Our ambition is to be a business with a commodity mix that is aligned with evolving customer demand in a decarbonising world.\n\nBut we cannot do it on our own. So we strive to create partnerships that solve problems and create win-win solutions with lower societal and environmental impact. The approach applies as much to large-scale, transformational innovation as to incremental everyday progress, such as our safety and operational performance.\n\nFatalities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2021: zero)\n\nWomen in our workforce\n\n22.9%\n\n(2021: 21.6%)\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\n$16.1bn\n\n(2021: $25.3bn)\n\nUnderlying EBITDA 2\n\n$26.3bn\n\n(2021: $37.7bn)\n\nAnd we are finding better ways to partner with Indigenous peoples and host communities.

Our focus is on growing our business while decarbonising, providing products to our customers that support the transition to a low-carbon economy and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders.\n\nMany of our products are essential for the energy transition: we expect this new source of demand, combined with traditional sources, to drive significant volume growth in our products over the coming decades. In developed markets, customer demand for low-carbon and recycled materials is growing with supply security top of mind. In developing economies, reliable access to raw materials for domestic processing is critical.

        "page_content": "For 150 years, we have been striving to find better ways - in how we face challenges, find solutions, celebrate our successes, and learn from our failures. Our strength and scale reflect the courage shown by past generations, and the curiosity of our current employees, who continue to shape important partnerships with companies, communities, and countries - constantly evolving our business and our products to support the world around us.\n\nWe have marked a wide range of milestones through our 150 years of operation; these are a few of the moments that shaped the Rio Tinto of today.\n\n## 150 years of Rio Tinto\n\n## 1873\n\n## Rio Tinto commences copper mining in Spain\n\nThe Rio Tinto Company was registered in London after a British-European investor group bought the Rio Tinto mines in Spain, first mined in Phoenician and Roman times. We introduced new processing facilities and techniques that transformed the operation, and by the turn of the century, we were producing 10% of the world's copper.\n\n## 2007\n\n## Becoming a global leader in aluminium\n\nWe acquired Alcan, becoming a global leader in aluminium, and further diversifying our portfolio. Through this deal, we also obtained access to water rights and renewable power through a vast network of hydropower facilities in Canada, a major competitive advantage to our smelting business. While Alcan was clearly a leader in green aluminium, the acquisition resulted in an unsustainable level of debt when the global financial crisis happened and left the company in a vulnerable financial situation.\n\n## 1929-1953\n\n## Exploring new lands\n\nWe looked beyond Spain's borders for growth opportunities, setting up a series of joint ventures to explore and develop mines, starting in 1929 with the great copper belt of what is now known as Zambia. Come 1952, our exploration team expanded into South Africa and Canada, and the following year Australia, resulting in new uranium mines in Canada and Australia.\n\n## 2000-2022\n\n## Shaping our portfolio\n\nAt the turn of the new century, we embarked on an acquisition and divestment programme, which simplified the business, focused the Group on large, low-cost mines and culminated in our divestment of our coal assets in 2018. We became the first major miner to cease coal production. We acquired North Ltd in 2000, significantly expanding our iron ore assets, including mines, rail and port capacity. And in 2006, we partnered with Ivanhoe Mines to construct and operate Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia. In 2022, we acquired full ownership of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, increasing our direct ownership in Oyu Tolgoi to 66%.\n\n## 2008-2019\n\n## Technology redefines the business\n\nIn an attempt to transform the efficiency and safety of the way we mine, we partnered with Komatsu to be among the first in the world to trial the world's first driverless haul trucks. This initiative set us on a path to become a global leader in fully integrated, automated mining. In 2019, together with our partner Hitachi, we launched the world's first fully autonomous, long-distance, heavy-haul rail network - AutoHaul TM .\n\n## 1955-1963\n\n## The red cliffs of Australia\n\nIn 1955, a geologist discovered bauxite in Queensland and commercial bauxite mining began at Weipa in 1963, where we still mine today.",

        "page_content": "## 1961-1973\n\n## The founding of our iron ore business in the Pilbara\n\nIn 1961, geologists set out across Western Australia to assess the iron ore prospects. By 1965, the signing of a long-term contract to supply the Japanese steel mills enabled us to develop our first iron ore mine in the Pilbara, and in 1966 we shipped our first iron ore to Japan. By 1973, we had started shipping to South Korea and China. Our partnerships with these countries endure today.\n\n## 2002\n\n## China supporting the iron ore boom\n\nThe rapid industrialisation of the Chinese economy and the emergence of China as a global economic power was a major catalyst for our iron ore business in the early 2000s. In 2002, we set up a joint venture with Baosteel Group to supply 10 million tonnes of iron ore per year over 20 years, supporting the expansion of our business in the Pilbara and marking our continuing and vital partnership with China.\n\n## 2018-2019\n\n## A step closer to carbon-free aluminium smelting\n\nIn 2018, we formed ELYSIS, in partnership with Alcoa and supported by Apple and the Governments of Canada and Quebec, which later delivered a disruptive technology that eliminates all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminium smelting process.\n\n## 1998\n\n## Tragedy sharpens safety focus\n\nA horrific disaster at our talc mine in Lassing, Austria, claimed the lives of ten members of our rescue team following a series of collapses. The profound impact of the Lassing disaster was a catalyst for major change in the way we manage safety. We had our first fatality-free year in 2019, with no fatalities since.\n\n## 2020\n\n## Juukan Gorge rock shelters\n\nOur destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters in Western Australia fell far short of our values and breached the trust placed in us by the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we operate. It is our collective responsibility to earn back the trust that has been lost, improve our internal practices and culture to minimise our impacts, and manage cultural heritage responsibly.\n\n## 1989\n\n## Securing copper and mineral assets\n\nWe were ready to focus solely on mining, so sold all oil and gas assets and set our sights on BP Minerals. We acquired Kennecott's Bingham Canyon copper and gold mine in Utah, US. The purchase also secured the RTIT Quebec Operations 1 in Quebec, Canada and interests in QIT Madagascar Minerals and Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa.\n\n## 1995\n\n## Becoming Rio Tinto\n\nIn one of the most significant events in our history, the RTZ Corporation PLC merged with ConZinc RioTinto of Australia (CRA) to form RTZ-CRA. In 1997, we changed our name to Rio Tinto plc/Ltd (dual listed), becoming one of the largest mining companies in the world.\n\n## 2021-2022\n\n## Creating a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace\n\nIn 2021, we commissioned an independent review of our workplace culture to better understand, prevent and respond to harmful behaviours across our operations. The review found disturbing cases of discrimination and sexual harassment in the business. We are now working to implement the 26 recommendations of the report, and to evolve our culture to create a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace.",

In recognition of this, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 225 US cents (2021: 417 US cents), taking total dividends declared to shareholders this year to $8 billion.\n\nMore broadly, Jakob Stausholm and his Executive team have led the Group out of a challenging period, with the foundations now being laid for us to become the global mining company of choice.\n\nA lot remains to be done. We must continue to focus on the pursuit of our four key objectives: becoming the best operator, having impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials, excelling in development and strengthening the Group's social licence. In particular, we must continue to strive for greater consistency in our operating performance. This year, we have secured a healthy pipeline of future growth projects Oyu Tolgoi (with the successful buyout of Turquoise Hill minority shareholders), Rhodes Ridge and Rincon, and the Western Range replacement project. These now need to be successfully developed, while we continue our efforts to realise other critical growth projects, such as Simandou, Resolution and Jadar.\n\nFinally, we must focus on embedding the important culture and leadership changes that are such critical enablers for achieving our strategic objectives and to creating the future organisation that we all wish to see.\n\n## Seizing opportunities\n\nSince joining as Chair, I have visited sites around the world and all of our hub offices, interacting with employees across all levels of the organisation. I have been amazed by the calibre of talent - from our engineers to our economists, from our ecologists to our explorers. There has been one common trait among everyone I have met - a focus on finding better ways of working and a determination to innovate.\n\nThe shift to electric vehicles and renewable power will require more copper, aluminium, lithium and high-quality iron ore to decarbonise society, but developing new mines is becoming more challenging. To excel in this future development, we must seek to partner with a strengthened social licence and to operate with impeccable ESG credentials. Strategically, we must think long term if we are to harness the right opportunities, while also keeping shorter-term opportunities and risks sharply in view.\n\nAlongside supplying the materials for the world's energy transition, we are aiming to reduce our own emissions by 50% by 2030 and to reach net zero by 2050. This a challenging set of targets but ones that we are determined to achieve. We are delivering this through a range of initiatives and partnerships that are helping us decarbonise our existing operations and secure green energy, as we support the development of low-carbon solutions to help our customers meet their own goals.\n\nWith access to more than four million hectares of land globally, we are looking to implement natural climate solutions on a significant scale. We also have the opportunity to be a leader in environment by finding better ways to manage water, care for species and rehabilitate land. These are areas where our drive to improve can bring significant social and local benefits.\n\n## Building a thriving culture\n\nI believe everything we aspire to achieve should be underpinned by our people feeling emotionally safe, empowered, included and respected. One of my priorities as Chair is to ensure that we create a work environment where everyone can be at their best.\n\nI commend Jakob and the Executive Committee for the care and courage shown in commissioning and openly sharing the external review of the company's workplace culture at the beginning of 2022. Since then, a great deal has been done to make positive change. The Board and I fully support the implementation of the 26 recommendations made in the Everyday Respect Report , which we are monitoring closely. We are working closely with Elizabeth Broderick, the former Australian Sex Discrimination Commissioner who conducted the report, on how we, as a Board, can help ensure progress and lead by example in embedding the culture changes that we all wish to see. We have also reinforced the Board and the Executive Committee's commitment in this area, by expanding our new Remuneration & People Committee's scope to include an ongoing focus on people and culture.\n\n## Incentivising the things that matter\n\nOne of the key learnings from the past few years is that how we achieve our strategy is just as important as what we achieve. As our strategy has evolved, so has the need for an appropriate incentive framework to better support it. In 2022, we undertook a review of our incentives and, from 2023, our Group short-term incentive plan (STIP), which applies to around 24,000 employees, will have a greater focus on how outcomes are achieved. By driving delivery of our four objectives in a manner consistent with our values and behaviours and which advance our culture change agenda, we are confident that we will see great progress towards our strategic ambitions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As travel restrictions began to ease in 2022, we stepped up meeting people in person, including regular dialogue with the Indigenous peoples of the land on which we operate, local communities, governments and, of course, our customers, suppliers and shareholders.\n\nWe also hosted three civil society roundtables, in Australia, Europe and North America. Engaging with civil society organisations is an important way for us to challenge ourselves to keep improving. One of the key topics of interest at this year's roundtables was the role that Rio Tinto can play in protecting biodiversity, as well as in the world's transition to a low-carbon future.\n\nI am encouraged by the progress our Communities and Social Performance teams have made this year, with new co-management agreements in place and improved ways of working to deliver better outcomes for Indigenous peoples. A highlight of 2022 was the creation of the Juukan Gorge Legacy Foundation as part of a remedy agreement reached with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation relating to the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in 2020. Earlier in the year, I was grateful to meet with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people for the first time and at a second meeting later in the year I heard how they feel our engagement and remediation have been progressing. As the leadership team continues to embed the values and new purpose across the business, I am convinced we will see even greater progress.\n\nThe Board also met with employees, through site visits, town halls and listening sessions. Feedback suggests that, although we need to continue to improve, people are optimistic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nabout the changes taking place, with good support for the new purpose and the Everyday Respect initiative. We are successful in attracting talented people, including more women, into Rio Tinto, but must now focus on retention.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the Board's engagement with our stakeholders, see pages 95-98.\n\n## Board changes\n\nWe have had some changes to the Board over the past year. Simon Thompson stepped down as Chairman in May 2022, and Hinda Gharbi retired from the Board at the conclusion of our annual general meeting in April. Our thanks go to Simon and Hinda for their outstanding service and contribution.\n\nIn 2022, we evaluated the mix of skills and experience on the Board, and concluded that we need to refresh our composition, with a particular focus on deepening our mining, operations and projects experience, as well as our renewable energy and sustainability capabilities. In December 2022, we announced the appointment of Kaisa Hietala as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 March 2023. Kaisa brings a deep understanding of renewables and sustainability from her experience in the resources industry, as well as broad commercial capabilities, and these are all qualities that will be invaluable as we work to ensure Rio Tinto thrives in a decarbonising world.\n\nSeparately, we have taken a fresh look at our governance arrangements to ensure that the Board and our committees are focusing our time on supporting the delivery of the Group's strategic objectives. This includes putting a greater emphasis on people and culture, on risk management and resilience capabilities, and on strengthening our social licence through stakeholder engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee my introduction to the Corporate Governance report on page 89.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs we enter 2023, we will need to maintain a keen eye on near-term opportunities and risks, while always creating sufficient time and space to capture key strategic opportunities as they emerge for the longer term.\n\nWithout doubt, there is considerable work ahead - to create a safe and empowering culture, to improve the consistency of our operational performance, to anticipate and respond to a shifting competitive landscape and to continue to strengthen our partnerships.\n\nBut as I look to the future, I am confident that we have all of the right ingredients in place great people, world-class assets, emerging technologies and new partnerships.\n\nAs we reach our 150 th anniversary this year, we have an opportunity to place the energy transition at the heart of our new strategy as we seek to diversify and extend our portfolio. This opportunity is now embodied in our new purpose: Finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs . And it is this new purpose that will drive the right decisions for our business, our shareholders, our other stakeholders and the environment.\n\nLet me end by thanking the leadership team and the many thousands of Rio Tinto employees, contractors and partners who delivered for the company and its shareholders during the year.\n\nDominic Barton Chair 22 February 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Chief Executive's Q&A\n\n## Q&A with Jakob Stausholm\n\n2022 highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnet cash generated from operating activities (2021: $25.3bn)\n\n$12.4bn\n\nprofit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto\n\n(2021: $21.1bn)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntotal dividend declared (2021: $16.8bn)\n\n## How did we perform in 2022?\n\nThis year has been all about progressing our strategy and delivering against our four objectives to build a stronger Rio Tinto for the long term. The strong foundations of our business - world-class assets, great people and strength of balance sheet - allowed us to achieve solid financial performance despite the challenging environment we faced. We definitely made progress in 2022, but there is lots more to do.\n\nMost importantly, 2022 was our fourth consecutive fatality-free year. But we continue to see serious incidents in our business and therefore we must continue to focus, every day, on strengthening our safety culture. This is about bringing together best practices from across the business and beyond to inform and improve our risk management and work planning. In terms of financials, we generated underlying earnings of $13.3 billion (2021: $21.4 billion) and net cash generated from operating activities of $16.1 billion (2021: $25.3 billion). Profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto was $12.4 billion (2021: $21.1 billion) and our balance sheet remains strong with net debt of $4.2 billion (2021: net cash of $1.6 billion). As a result, the Board has recommended a final ordinary dividend of 225 US cents per share, resulting in total shareholder returns declared this year of $8 billion. This represents a pay-out ratio of 60%, in line with our policy.\n\n## What was the thinking behind the new purpose, 'finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs'?\n\nDefining our purpose was an exciting process. We looked at what society needs and then considered our own strengths and found ten words that really capture our contribution to the world. It's partly in our DNA, and partly about setting the direction for the company to evolve. It speaks to our drive for both innovation and continuous improvement, while also emphasising how materials are produced. Consumers are looking for lower-carbon materials, which must be produced responsibly, and we are continuously seeking ways to do things better.\n\n## How can evolving our culture unlock improvements needed to make us the best operator?\n\nChanging our culture is key to achieving each of our four objectives. When people feel respected and valued, they feel empowered to be their best selves and bring their best ideas. For example, our Safe Production System (SPS) relies on this - unlocking the potential of our employees, their skills and expertise, and creating stable, predictable operations. I've been impressed by our progress in 2022, achieving a number of operational records, including a record second half performance across the Pilbara iron ore mine and rail system. We now have 30 deployments at 16 sites and 86 Kaizens (rapid problem-solving activities) completed or in progress. We are seeing excellent results. Where we have been deploying the SPS, we have sites that are safer, more engaged employees, and assets that are more productive. We will continue to deploy the SPS to more sites in 2023.\n\nMore broadly, we are embedding a change in mindset and behaviours throughout the organisation, with the implementation of the Everyday Respect Report recommendations being absolutely crucial to driving this change. Achieving culture change will take time, but we are heading in the right direction.\n\n## How are we progressing our objective to achieve impeccable ESG credentials?\n\nStarting with our social licence, for the past two years we have been changing the way we partner, especially with Indigenous peoples and the communities where we work. Moving to a model of co-management of land and waters, and improving our agreements, will deliver more enduring socioeconomic, heritage and environmental outcomes and, in turn, greater certainty for mine development. And we have continued to develop cultural competency across the Group to help us become a better partner.",

        "page_content": "'The early evidence of progress against each of the four objectives is heartening, not just in terms of our 2022 performance, but also in giving us confidence that we have a truly exciting improvement journey in the years to come.'\n\nIn terms of climate change, quite frankly we have not advanced our abatement projects as fast as we would like. But despite that our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 7% below our 2018 baseline. Our capital spend on decarbonisation was also lower than we anticipated in 2021. It is important to note that this is a multi-decade journey and today we have a more robust roadmap to our 2030 and 2050 targets.\n\nWe are ramping up our technical skills, building competencies and capabilities, and forming partnerships across our value chain to find solutions to some of the bigger challenges we are facing. We have set up six large abatement programmes focused on the decarbonisation challenges that cut across our product groups: repowering our Pacific Aluminium Operations, renewables, ELYSIS TM , alumina process heat, minerals processing and diesel transition. We have also established one additional programme to increase our investments in nature-based solutions projects and expect these to make a more significant contribution to our targets. Some of the technology we need to reach net zero by 2050 does not exist today, so we established the Office of the Chief Scientist and increased our yearly research and development target spend to $400 million. We know we can't solve these challenges alone, so we're also partnering with other organisations to find solutions. The ELYSIS partnership to develop emissions-free aluminium smelting technology is a good example of this.\n\n## Our objective to excel in development is all about growing in materials enabling the low-carbon transition. How did we perform in 2022?\n\nWe expect the energy transition will add as much as 25% in additional demand above traditional sources across our key products by 2035. That is why our strategy is about growing in the materials required to achieve the energy transition, such as copper, lithium and high-quality iron ore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA highlight this year was resetting our relationship with the Mongolian Government and successfully executing our first significant M&A in a decade through our acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. This doubled our interest in Oyu Tolgoi to 66%, a mine that is on track to be the fourth-largest copper mine in the world.\n\nWe progressed our Western Range and Rhodes Ridge iron ore projects in Western Australia, positioning us strongly to meet future customer needs. They are both exciting developments - Western Range represents our first co-designed mine with Traditional Owners, and the Rhodes Ridge deposits are among the largest and highest quality undeveloped resources globally.\n\nAt the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, we are working through all necessary permits and approvals in relation to the infrastructure. We have also hired critical roles with a significant focus on local Guinean businesses.\n\nIn lithium, we acquired the Rincon project in Argentina for $825 million. We have also approved $194 million to develop a small starter battery-grade lithium carbonate plant with a capacity of 3,000 tonnes per year and first saleable production in 2024. As part of this, we are progressing early works, including constructing a camp and airstrip. We also continue to believe that the Jadar lithiumborate project in Serbia can contribute to enhancing the electric vehicle supply chain ecosystem in Serbia. We are exploring options with all stakeholders on how to progress this world-class opportunity to the highest environmental standards.\n\n## Our fourth objective, strengthening our social licence, is ultimately judged by others. What have been some of your highlights this year?\n\nWe've been working hard to implement meaningful change in the way we partner with communities. Over the past 12 months we have signed new agreements with the Yindjibarndi and Yinhawangka people in Australia, and the Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation in Canada.\n\nMost notably, in November we signed an agreement with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people to create the Juukan Gorge Legacy Foundation as part of the remedy for the destruction of the rock shelters in May 2020. This is a significant step forward, but we know it will be a long journey to rebuild trust.\n\n## What is the focus of 2023?\n\nI am really excited about the momentum we're building. We have a clear purpose, an ambitious strategy, and I am convinced we have the best people in the industry. The early evidence of progress against each of the four objectives is heartening, not just in terms of our 2022 performance, but also in giving us confidence that we have a truly exciting improvement journey in the years to come.\n\nFor me, 2023 is all about making further progress against our strategy and delivering on our key projects. We will continue to empower and unleash the quality of our people through the SPS and develop both leadership and technical excellence. We will advance projects like Rincon and Simandou, and at Oyu Tolgoi we expect to reach sustainable production in the first quarter of the year. As we mark 150 years of Rio Tinto, we will reflect on our past and the role it has played in our evolution and in helping us live our purpose in the future. Our people are at the very centre of this over the next year we will continue our work to transform our culture and how we partner with our stakeholders. I want to thank our thousands of employees and contractors, host governments and communities, customers, shareholders and partners. Together, we're committed to finding better ways to deliver well into the next 150 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJakob Stausholm Chief Executive 22 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Strategic context\n\n## Our scenario approach\n\nWe use global scenarios in our strategy and capital allocation processes to stress test our portfolio and investment decisions under alternative macroeconomic settings. Our scenario framework focuses on two prevailing macro-level business concerns: the speed of global economic growth and the trajectory of climate action, each heavily influenced by global geopolitics and governance.\n\nConsistent with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, our central reference case commodity forecasts and valuations are informed by a blend of our two core scenarios (Competitive Leadership and Fragmented Leadership). These are used to derive critical accounting estimates and are included as inputs for impairment testing; estimating remaining economic life for units of production, depreciation and discounting; and closure and rehabilitation provisions. Further detail is provided in 'Impact of climate change on the Group' section to the financial statements on pages 152-155.\n\nWe use additional scenarios (including our Aspirational Leadership scenario, which is aligned with the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement) to further stress test decisions and assess potential risks to our portfolio.\n\n## Our two core scenarios\n\nCompetitive Leadership reflects a world of high growth and strong climate action post-2030, with change driven by policy and competitive innovation. A proactive reform environment encourages business innovation and helps boost investment and productivity. This allows global GDP to continue growing at near recent historical levels with an increasing contribution from India and other developing countries.\n\nFragmented Leadership represents a world where economic growth and climate action are constrained by ineffective policy and rising social and geopolitical tensions. In this world, investment in new technologies slows and their global adoption is highly inconsistent. This, combined with more significant climate damage, results in weaker long-term productivity growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our scenarios, methodology and portfolio implications, see our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.\n\nOur strategy is informed by a deep analysis of the interplay of global megatrends, explored through the lens of plausible scenarios. These set the context for our industry and underpin our portfolio choices and how we operate. Our success relies on our ability to strengthen our resilience to the physical, societal and economic effects of climate change and the energy transition, while building partnerships and capabilities that enable us to secure new opportunities.\n\n## Energy transition and climate action\n\nWhile global efforts to tackle climate change have continued, the long-term pledges made by governments and companies still fall short of what is required to limit the global temperature rise to below 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. In recognition of this, and faced with increasing societal demands, governments are creating new policies to support the development of low-carbon economies. These include the US's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).\n\nIncreasing electrification and renewable energy incentives will bolster demand for several commodities, including lithium, copper, aluminium and high-grade iron ore. Interventions by governments are becoming as important as traditional market forces for commodity trajectories and will have important implications for project economics and regional price premiums. New policies could help incentivise new mining projects and accelerate the deployment of large-scale renewable energy and firming solutions essential for steel and aluminium production.\n\n## Geopolitical tensions and global supply disruption\n\nThe compound effects of COVID-19 and ongoing geopolitical issues have resulted in major disruption to the global supply of goods and services. The onset of the Russia-Ukraine war resulted in extreme price volatility for fossil fuels and several metals, contributing to record inflation in some jurisdictions. The ongoing global energy crisis and growing concerns about an economic downturn have continued to erode trust in global institutions, fuelling a backlash against globalisation in some quarters. In addition, we have seen increasing regional tensions surrounding new climate policies as governments look to tackle climate change while addressing energy supply issues.\n\nSupply chain disruptions have helped support prices for several key products including iron ore, aluminium, copper and nickel, where Russia is a major global supplier. However, the mining sector has faced headwinds, including increased energy costs and ongoing mobility and procurement challenges, which have put pressure on margins across most commodities. Geopolitical tensions have also exacerbated concerns for critical mineral supply, with governments showing increasing support for new projects to help diversify and nearshore supply.\n\n## Evolving customer demands\n\nCustomers are becoming more ESG-conscious in their purchasing behaviours, taking into consideration a range of sustainability themes beyond carbon footprint, including biodiversity, water consumption, waste generation and social impact. This is helping to drive a holistic shift towards increasingly transparent, sustainable and circular value chains.\n\nMining companies will need to work closely with a range of stakeholders to improve their ESG metrics and attract new customers and partners. A key opportunity is in recycling, which could allow metal suppliers to supplement their low-carbon primary products with highly sustainable recycled materials to create unique commercial offerings for customers. Nature-based solutions could also provide new revenue streams, while creating opportunities for communities and helping drive emissions towards net zero.",

We aim to strengthen our resilience to changing market fundamentals and pursue new opportunities and partnerships that help deliver strong returns and growth options for our business, reduce our environmental footprint and aid our customers in their efforts to decarbonise.\n\n## Our strategy has three pillars\n\n## Accelerate the decarbonisation of our assets\n\nDue to the scale of our mining operations and processing activities we have significant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (30.3Mt CO 2 e). We are working with a range of stakeholders to find commercial and technology solutions to repower our assets, deploy large-scale renewables, scale up ELYSIS TM , decarbonise process heat and replace diesel across our portfolio.\n\n## Develop products and technologies that help our customers decarbonise\n\nOur Scope 3 emissions were 584Mt CO 2 e in 2022 - over 1% of the global total. We are working closely with our customers and others to develop more secure and sustainable value chains and accelerate the development of cleaner production pathways for our products. Processing of iron ore accounts for two-thirds of our Scope 3 emissions.\n\n## Grow in materials essential for the energy transition\n\nThe energy transition will create significant additional demand for our commodities, including copper, lithium and aluminium. We aim to grow in these commodities as well as in the production of high-quality iron ore. This iron ore will support the production of low-carbon steel required for infrastructure for the energy transition and ongoing urbanisation.\n\nWe will deliver our strategy through four objectives, which guide how we want to run our business: to be the best operator, to achieve impeccable ESG credentials, to excel in development and to strengthen our social licence. These essential components will help improve our productivity, reduce capital intensity and assist us in becoming a partner of choice for a range of stakeholders globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur culture is a key enabler of our strategic ambitions. It will guide us on the journey to best operator, make us a better partner and help us solve problems as we work towards net zero.\n\nBy building a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace, we can attract and retain curious people who care about their work and colleagues and are courageous about finding better ways to do things - this is how we will deliver on our purpose.\n\n## Best operator\n\nWe aim to improve our operational performance by identifying and replicating best practices across our portfolio and empowering our people to make positive changes.\n\n## Impeccable ESG credentials\n\nWe will strive to align our business priorities with society's expectations and ensure sustainability considerations are at the core of every decision we make.\n\n## Excel in development\n\nWe will expand and progress our pipeline of growth opportunities and build capabilities and partnerships to execute projects and establish a strong track record of capitalefficient delivery.\n\n## Social licence\n\nWe need to be humbler and more responsive, building meaningful relationships and partnerships with our stakeholders by listening, learning and respecting diverse perspectives.",

To help embed our values throughout the business, we updated our Code of Conduct in early 2023.\n\n## Care\n\nWe act with care by prioritising the physical and emotional safety and wellbeing of those around us.\n\nWe respect others, build trusting relationships and consider the impact of our actions.\n\nWe look for ways to contribute to a better future for our people, communities and the planet.\n\nOyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, Mongolia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are finding better ways to support and empower our people, which means creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable being themselves, has the courage to speak up if something is not right and listens to each other with care and curiosity.\n\n## Courage\n\nWe act with courage by showing integrity, speaking up when something is not right and taking decisive action when needed.\n\nWe are not afraid to try new things.\n\nWe respond positively in difficult situations and demonstrate commitment to achieving shared goals.\n\nGuided by our values, we are committed to building a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace.\n\nThere are elements of our culture today that we are proud of and want to amplify, such as our commitment to safety, teamwork and agility in times of change. But we know there is more to do in some areas, and we recognise that how we achieve is just as important as what we achieve.\n\nIn February 2022, we reported the findings and recommendations from the Everyday Respect Repor t, an independent review of our workplace culture that we commissioned to better understand, prevent and respond to harmful behaviours across our global operations. We know from the findings that we can do better as a company. We aspire to be a home for curious people who care about their work and colleagues and are courageous about finding better ways to do things. This starts with ensuring everyone feels safe, respected and included. Implementing the 26 recommendations from the report is one way we are evolving our culture, this was a primary focus for 2022 and it will continue in 2023.\n\nWe have accelerated some immediate actions:\n\n- -Building capable leaders. We have trained 91% of our leaders in the foundations of building psychological safety and moving from bystander to upstander, exceeding our target of 80% by the end of 2022.\n- -Creating safe and inclusive facilities. All sites have completed a self-assessment of their facilities, and unsafe areas such as locks, lighting and access to amenities have been updated. This work is ongoing and done in collaboration with our employees to make our facilities safe and more inclusive .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the Everyday Respect initiative, visit riotinto.com/everydayrespect.\n\n## Curiosity\n\nWe act with curiosity by inviting diverse ideas and collaborating to achieve more together than can be done alone.\n\nWe are continuously learning and creatively looking for better and safer ways of doing things.\n\nWe draw inspiration from others and the world around us.\n\n- -Providing a more people-centric response. We expanded the scope of work for the Business Conduct Office (BCO) and developed a discrete unit that will be responsible for delivering safe, confidential and caring support. For more information about the BCO and our confidential reporting programme myVoice, see page 74.\n\nWe want to play our part in eliminating harmful behaviours, and we are also working closely with industry bodies across the globe to implement changes and collectively evolve our industry.\n\nTo further support our culture journey, in 2022 we also:\n\n- - Updated our global minimum standard for paid parental leave to suit different family needs.\n- - Continued to increase the number of women in our workforce, from 21.6% to 22.9%.\n- - Developed, empowered and invested in our people through the Safe Production System and the Voyager development programme for senior leaders.\n- - Reviewed our incentives and performance management framework. From 2023, our performance management and incentives for around 24,000 people will be aligned to our strategy and culture journey, focusing on both how and what we deliver.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nabout our people, see pages 59-60.",

We are focusing on creating a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace where our people feel empowered and engaged. Guided by our values, we are evolving our culture: we are implementing the recommendations from the Everyday Respect Report, rolling out the Safe Production System, enhancing our safety maturity model, empowering our people, training our leaders and listening to employee feedback through our employee survey.

In the longer term, underlying ROCE also influences TSR, which is included in the long-term incentive plan (see pages 124-125).\n\n## Definition\n\nThis KPI refers to cash generated by our operations after tax and interest, including dividends received from equity accounted units and dividends paid to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries.\n\n## Relevance to strategy\n\nThis KPI measures our ability to convert underlying earnings into cash.\n\n## Link to executive remuneration\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities is included in the short-term incentive plan. In the longer term, the measure influences TSR, which is included in the long-term incentive plan (see pages 124-125).\n\n## Our performance in 2022\n\nUnderlying ROCE decreased 19 percentage points to 25% in 2022, reflecting the decrease in underlying earnings driven by lower iron ore prices, and an increase in capital employed due to capital expenditure and acquisitions.\n\n## Forward plan\n\nWe will continue to focus on maximising returns from our assets over the short, medium and long term. We will invest in value-accretive growth options for materials that will be privileged in a decarbonising world.\n\n## Our performance in 2022\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of $16.1 billion was 36% lower than 2021. This was primarily due to lower iron ore prices, higher energy and raw material costs partially offset by lower taxes paid.\n\n## Forward plan\n\nWe will focus on effectively delivering strong and resilient cash flows from our quality portfolio of assets throughout the cycle.",

While the business remained resilient, cyclical cost inflation accelerated, leading to pressure on margins. We experienced cost increases as a result of COVID-19, the commodity cycle and broad-based market inflation. Our focus has been to remain disciplined, leading to net cash generated from operating activities of $16.1 billion, underlying earnings of $13.3 billion and profit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of $12.4 billion.\n\nWe maintained our financial strength, ending the year with net debt of $4.2 billion, compared with a net cash position of $1.6 billion at the end of 2021, with the movement reflecting, in part, our acquisitions of the Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ) minorities and the Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina. This balance sheet strength enables us to run our business consistently and maintain investment, regardless of where we are in the cycle. We do not have a net debt target, but have a principles-based approach to anchor the balance sheet around a single A credit rating.\n\n## Disciplined investing for growth and decarbonisation\n\nWe will continue to invest consistently through the cycle, balancing near-term returns to shareholders with reinvestment for growth and de-risking future cash flows. Essential capital remains our priority for capital allocation. It includes sustaining capital to ensure the integrity of our assets, high-returning replacement projects and decarbonisation investment. This is followed by ordinary dividends within our well-established returns policy. We then test investment in compelling growth projects against debt management and additional cash returns to shareholders.\n\nIn 2022, we made some significant investments in growth with the $0.8 billion acquisition of Rincon and the $3.1 billion purchase of non-controlling interests in TRQ, giving us a 66% shareholding in the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, our largest growth project. Our exploration and evaluation spend also gathered momentum at $0.9 billion, with greenfield exploration mainly focused on copper and evaluation prioritised on those\n\nprojects where we expect near-term investment decisions. Capital expenditure decreased by 9% to $6.8 billion, reflecting a stronger US dollar and the successful commissioning of our Pilbara iron ore replacement projects in Western Australia.\n\nWe expect a disciplined increase in capital expenditure over the coming years as our growth projects accelerate and decarbonisation projects advance. This is critical to ensure we have the right portfolio to keep creating value for decades to come, to benefit from the energy transition.\n\n## 60% average payout on the ordinary dividend over the past seven years\n\nOur shareholder returns policy dates back to 2016. We have committed to returning 40% to 60% of underlying earnings on average through the cycle, with additional returns in periods of strong earnings and cash generation. Over the past seven years, we have paid out at the top end of the range, at 60% for the ordinary dividend, in each year.\n\nWe have remained very consistent with our shareholder returns policy, with the payout ratio giving us some flexibility with regard to the macro-economic environment. It remains a core part of our equity story, which we see as paramount for maintaining discipline. Our financial strength means that we can reinvest for growth, accelerate our decarbonisation and continue to pay attractive dividends through the cycle.\n\nFor 2022, we are returning 60% of underlying earnings to shareholders, which equates to a full-year ordinary dividend of 492 US cents per share, or $8.0 billion.\n\n## Energy transition drives additional long-term value\n\nWe foresee a significant uplift in new demand from the energy transition - adding as much as 25% over and above traditional sources of demand on a copper equivalent basis across our key products by 2035.\n\nDecarbonisation is therefore positive for our industry. Given that the world will need more aluminium, more copper, more high-grade iron ore and more lithium, this is where we are focusing our growth investments.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## $16.1 billion\n\n(2021: $25.3 billion)\n\nProfit after tax attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (net earnings)\n\n## $12.4 billion\n\n(2021: $21.1 billion)\n\nUnderlying earnings\n\n## $13.3 billion\n\n(2021: $21.4 billion)\n\nHowever, we will only invest in quality assets which give robust returns under a range of economic, geopolitical and carbon scenarios, creating a resilient portfolio with significant upside to the energy transition. We will continue to allocate our capital with great discipline and remain committed to attractive shareholder returns, underpinned by our resilient cash flows and the strength of our balance sheet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Peter Cunningham\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n22 February 2023\n\n25",

        "page_content": "- - $16.1 billion in net cash generated from operating activities, 36% lower than 2021, was primarily driven by price movements for our major commodities and a $0.5 billion rise in working capital, primarily due to elevated prices for raw materials in aluminium inventory. We also incurred some items of a non-recurring nature which were not representative of the underlying strength of the performance of the business. These comprised; higher tax payments (relative to profit) in 2022 as a result of a $1.1 billion (A$1.5 billion) final payment to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in respect of 2021 profits; $0.4 billion (A$0.6 billion) settlement with the ATO in respect of 12 historical years; and $0.4 billion of cash losses from currency hedges on our external dividends. At the end of 2022, we had no material outstanding tax payable on Australian profits.\n- -We made some significant investments in growth with the $0.8 billion acquisition of Rincon and the $3.0 billion 2 purchase of noncontrolling interests in TRQ (including transaction costs), giving us a 66% shareholding in the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine, our largest growth project. Our capital expenditure of $6.8 billion encompassed\n\n- $0.6 billion of growth capital, $2.2 billion of replacement capital, $3.9 billion of sustaining capital and $0.1 billion of decarbonisation spend. We funded our capital expenditure from operating activities and expect to continue funding our capital programme from internal sources, except for the Oyu Tolgoi underground development, which is project-financed.\n- - $11.7 billion of dividends paid in 2022, being the 2021 final ordinary and special dividends paid in April 2022 ($7.6 billion) and the 2022 interim ordinary dividend paid in September ($4.1 billion), including foreign exchange impacts.\n- - The above movements, together with disposals including the $525 million of cash received from the sale of the gross production royalty at the Cortez Complex in Nevada, USA (Cortez royalty), resulted in net cash 1 decreasing by $5.8 billion in 2022, and gave rise to net debt 1 of $4.2 billion at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings by product group\n\n|                                                                        | Underlying EBITDA   | Underlying EBITDA   |          | Underlying earnings   | Underlying earnings   |          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Year ended 31 December                                                 | 2022  US$m          | 2021  US$m          | Change % | 2022  US$m            | 2021  US$m            | Change % |\n| Iron Ore                                                               | 18,612              | 27,592              | (33) %   | 11,182                | 17,323                | (35) %   |\n| Aluminium                                                              | 3,672               | 4,382               | (16) %   | 1,472                 | 2,468                 | (40) %   |\n| Copper                                                                 | 2,376               | 3,969               | (40) %   | 521                   | 1,579                 | (67) %   |\n| Minerals                                                               | 2,419               | 2,603               | (7) %    | 849                   | 888                   | ( 4 )  % |\n| Reportable segment total                                               | 27,079              | 38,546              | (30) %   | 14,024                | 22,258                | (37) %   |\n| Other operations                                                       | (16)                | (28)                | (43) %   | (340)                 | (84)                  | 305 %    |\n| Inter-segment transactions                                             | 24                  | 42                  | (43) %   | 26                    | 19                    | 37 %     |\n| Central pension costs, share-based payments, insurance and derivatives | 377                 | 110                 | 243 %    | 374                   | 133                   | 181 %    |\n| Restructuring, project and one-off costs                               | (173)               | (80)                | 116 %    | (87)                  | (51)                  | 71 %     |\n| Other central costs                                                    | (766)               | (613)               | 25 %     | (651)                 | (585)                 | 11 %     |\n| Central exploration and evaluation                                     | (253)               | (257)               | ( 2 )  % | (209)                 | (215)                 | (3) %    |\n| Net interest                                                           |                     |                     |          | 138                   | (95)                  | (245) %  |\n| Total                                                                  | 26,272              | 37,720              | (30) %   | 13,275                | 21,380                | (38) %   |\n\nUnderlying EBITDA and underlying earnings are APMs used by management to assess the performance of the business, and provide additional information which investors may find useful. APMs are reconciled to directly comparable IFRS financial measures on pages 273 to 278.\n\n## Continuing to invest in greenfield exploration\n\nWe have a strong portfolio of greenfield exploration projects in early exploration and studies stages, with activity in 18 countries across seven commodities. This is reflected in our pre-tax central spend of $253 million in 2022. The bulk of this exploration expenditure was focused on copper projects in Australia, Colombia, Namibia, Peru, the United States and Zambia; diamonds in Angola; and heavy mineral sands projects in Australia and South Africa. Exploration is ongoing for nickel in Canada and Finland and in lithium across all regions, with opportunities emerging in the United States and Africa. Minelease exploration continued at Rio Tinto managed businesses, including Pilbara Iron in Australia, Diavik in Canada and Cape York bauxite operations in Australia.\n\n## Commentary on financial results\n\nTo provide additional insight into the performance of our business, we report underlying EBITDA and underlying earnings. The principal factors explaining the movements in underlying EBITDA are set out in this table.\n\n|                                               | US$m    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 2021 underlying EBITDA                        | 37,720  |\n| Prices                                        | (8,101) |\n| Exchange rates                                | 801     |\n| Volumes and mix                               | 606     |\n| General inflation                             | (1,478) |\n| Energy                                        | (1,169) |\n| Operating cash unit costs                     | (2,202) |\n| Higher exploration and evaluation expenditure | (171)   |\n| Non-cash costs/other                          | 266     |\n| 2022 underlying EBITDA                        | 26,272  |\n\n27",

        "page_content": "## Solid financial results impacted by significant movements in commodity prices\n\nWe saw significant movement in pricing for our commodities, amidst growing recession fears and a decline in consumer confidence.\n\nMovements in commodity prices resulted in a $8,101 million decline in underlying EBITDA overall compared with 2021. This was primarily from lower iron ore prices ($9,155 million) and lower London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices and a negative provisional pricing impact ($733  million).\n\nThis was partly offset by a price uplift for our Aluminium business ($886 million), driven by a first-half rise in LME prices, improved product premiums and higher alumina pricing, which fell away sharply in the second half. We have included a table of prices and exchange rates on page 344.\n\nThe monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to a Free on Board (FOB) basis was 25% lower on average compared with 2021.\n\nThe average LME price for copper was 6% lower, while the average LME aluminium price was 9% higher, compared with 2021. The gold price was flat compared with 2021.\n\nThe midwest premium duty paid for aluminium in the US averaged $655 per tonne, 12% higher than in 2021.\n\n## Weaker local currencies during 2022\n\nCompared with 2021, on average, the US dollar strengthened by 8% against the Australian dollar and by 4% against the Canadian dollar. Currency movements increased underlying EBITDA by $801 million relative to 2021.\n\n## Improvement in sales volumes and mix\n\nHigher sales volumes and changes in product mix across the portfolio increased underlying EBITDA by $606 million compared to 2021. This was mostly attributable to increased iron ore sales from the ramp-up of Gudai-Darri along with higher portside sales in China, and favourable value-added product premiums for our Aluminium business.\n\n## Impact of rising inflation and significantly higher energy prices\n\nAverage movements in energy prices compared with 2021 reduced underlying EBITDA by $1,169 million, mainly due to higher diesel prices for our trucks, trains and ships. In addition, rising general price inflation across our global operations resulted in a $1,478 million reduction in underlying EBITDA, including $0.2 billion for the impact of higher than expected inflation on closure provisions (for closed or fully impaired sites and environmental liabilities).\n\n## Disciplined focus on costs offset some of the marketlinked increases\n\nWe remained focused on cost control throughout the year, in particular maintaining discipline on fixed costs. However, a rise in our operating cash unit costs reduced underlying EBITDA by $2,202 million (on a unit cost basis) compared with 2021. This mainly reflected cyclical cost pressures from higher market-linked prices for raw materials, in particular in our Aluminium business. We also experienced fixed cost inefficiencies from lower volumes at our Pacific alumina refineries and at the Boyne aluminium smelter due to production disruptions. In addition, we increased resourcing in our iron ore business to support the ramp-up at Gudai-Darri and targeted investment in pit health and asset maintenance across the Pilbara.\n\n## Increasing our global exploration and evaluation activity\n\nWe increased our exploration and evaluation expenditure by $171 million, or 24%, to $897 million. This was mainly attributable to increased activity at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea and the Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina.\n\n## Non-cash costs/other\n\nMovements in non-cash costs, one-off and other items increased underlying EBITDA by $266 million compared with 2021. This mainly reflected the acquisition of the remaining 40% of Diavik in November 2021 (+$163 million), lower incremental COVID-19 costs (+$123 million), gain on asset sale at Kennecott (+$133 million) and lower charges to the income statement on updates to closure cost estimates relating to closed and legacy sites (+$166 million). This was partially offset by reduced capacity at the Kitimat aluminium smelter (-$329 million) as ramp-up activities progressed in 2022 following the strike which commenced in July 2021.\n\n## Net earnings\n\nThe principal factors explaining the movements in underlying earnings and net earnings are set out below.\n\n|                                                                            | US$m     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| 2021 net earnings                                                          | 21,094   |\n| Total changes in underlying EBITDA                                         | (11,448) |\n| Increase in depreciation and amortisation (pre-tax) in underlying earnings | (319)    |\n| Increase in interest and finance items (pre-tax) in underlying earnings    | (1,112)  |\n| Decrease in tax on underlying earnings                                     | 3,949    |\n| Decrease in underlying earnings attributable to outside interests          | 825      |\n| Total changes in underlying earnings                                       | (8,105)  |\n| Changes in exclusions from underlying earnings:                            |          |\n| Write-off of Federal deferred tax assets in the United States              | (820)    |\n| Movement in exchange differences and gains/losses on derivatives           | (683)    |\n| Gain recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada's project                | (230)    |\n| Loss on disposal of interest in subsidiary                                 | (105)    |\n| Movement in impairment charges net of reversals                            | 145      |\n| Movement in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)     | 793      |\n| Gain on sale of Cortez royalty                                             | 331      |\n| 2022 net earnings                                                          | 12,420   |\n\n28",

        "page_content": "## Depreciation and amortisation, net interest and finance items, tax and non-controlling interests\n\nThe depreciation and amortisation charge was $319 million higher than 2021, mainly due to an increase in capitalised closure costs in 2021 at a number of our Aluminium sites. Our capital base was also higher in Iron Ore, Copper and Minerals as a result of our investment activities. This was partially offset by a stronger US dollar against the Australian dollar.\n\nInterest and finance items (pre-tax) were higher mainly as a result of a $1,101 million increase in amortisation of discount on provisions, as higher inflation had an impact on the Group's closure and restoration/ environmental liabilities. The amortisation charge of $1,517 million (2021: $415 million) incorporates an estimate of inflation at the start of each six-month reporting period. At the end of each half year we update the underlying cash flows for the latest estimate of experienced inflation for the current financial year and record this as 'changes to existing provisions'. For operating sites this adjustment usually results in a corresponding adjustment to Property, plant and equipment, and for closed and fully impaired sites the adjustment is charged or credited to the Income statement. These income statement amounts are included within underlying earnings except for the re-measurement of provisions for legacy sites that were never operated by Rio Tinto.\n\nThe 2022 effective corporate income tax rate on pre-tax earnings, excluding equity accounted units, was 30.9%, compared with 27.7% in 2021. The effective tax rate on pre-tax earnings in Australia was 31.7% in 2022, compared with 30.7% in 2021. We reached agreement with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) on all tax matters in dispute. As part of this agreement, in August we paid the ATO additional tax of A$613 million for the period from 2010 to 2021. Over this 12-year period, we paid nearly A$80 billion in tax and royalties in Australia.\n\n## Items excluded from underlying earnings\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 in the United States may give rise to investment credits on some of our existing projects, with longer dated projects potentially becoming more favourable. However, it also includes a new Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax regime, which has led to the Group reviewing the carrying value of US Federal deferred tax balances. The resulting $820 million write down of Federal deferred tax assets has been excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of materiality.\n\nIn 2022, we recognised an exchange and derivative loss of $137 million. This includes losses of $373 million on revaluation of certain derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting. These include currency hedges relating to our external dividends, and exchange losses of $262 million on US dollar debt in non-US dollar functional currency Group companies, partly offset by $478 million of exchange gains on intragroup balances. These losses compared with a 2021 gain of $546\n\nmillion, giving rise to an unfavourable year-on-year movement of $683 million. The exchange gains are largely offset by currency translation losses recognised in equity. The quantum of US dollar debt is largely unaffected and we will repay it from US dollar sales receipts.\n\nDuring 2022, LNG Canada elected to terminate their option to purchase additional land at Kitimat, Canada. This resulted in a $106 million gain which includes the release of deferred income and receipt of a cancellation fee payment. During 2021, we recognised a $336 million gain on recognition of a new wharf at Kitimat that was built and paid for by LNG Canada. These gains have been excluded from underlying earnings consistent with prior years, as they are part of a series of material transactions unrelated to the core business.\n\nImpairment charges, net of reversals, decreased by $145 million compared with 2021. In 2022, we impaired the remaining full value of the Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia, as a result of reduced capacity and the high cost of energy from the coal-fired power station impacting economic performance. In 2022, we also completed the sale of the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project in Saskatchewan, Canada, which resulted in a reversal of previous impairments.\n\nThere is a detailed explanation of the impairment process on pages 165 to 168.\n\nIn 2022, we recognised $178 million in closure costs representing adjustments to the closure estimates relating to legacy sites where the disturbance preceded ownership by Rio Tinto, including inflationary increases to provisions for these sites in excess of the unwind of discount. This was $793 million lower than 2021 closure charges, which related to Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), Gove refinery and Diavik closure provision increases, and further increases at a number of the Group's legacy sites where the disturbance preceded our ownership.\n\nIn 2022, we completed the $525 million sale of a gold royalty which was retained following the disposal of the Cortez mine in 2008. The carrying value of the royalty at 31 December 2021 was $88 million, resulting in a post-tax gain of $331 million. This has been excluded from underlying earnings on the grounds of materiality.\n\n## Profit\n\nNet earnings and underlying earnings refer to amounts attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto. The net profit attributable to the owners of Rio Tinto in 2022 was $12.4 billion (2021: $21.1 billion). We recorded a profit after tax in 2022 of $13.1 billion (2021: $22.6 billion) of which a profit of $0.7 billion (2021: $1.5 billion) was attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\n## Net earnings and underlying earnings\n\nThe differences between underlying earnings and net earnings are set out in this table (all numbers are after tax and exclude non-controlling interests).\n\n|                                                                                                                               | Year ended  31 December  2022 US$m   | Year ended  31 December  2021 US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Underlying earnings                                                                                                           | 13,275                               | 21,380                               |\n| Items excluded from underlying earnings                                                                                       |                                      |                                      |\n| Impairment charges net of reversals                                                                                           | (52)                                 | (197)                                |\n| Gains recognised by Kitimat relating to LNG Canada's project                                                                  | 106                                  | 336                                  |\n| Loss on disposal of interest in subsidiary                                                                                    | (105)                                | -                                    |\n| Foreign exchange and derivative gains on net debt and intragroup balances and derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting | (137)                                | 546                                  |\n| Change in closure estimates (non-operating and fully impaired sites)                                                          | (178)                                | (971)                                |\n| Gain on sale of Cortez royalty                                                                                                | 331                                  | -                                    |\n| Write-off of Federal deferred tax assets in the United States                                                                 | (820)                                | -                                    |\n| Net earnings                                                                                                                  | 12,420                               | 21,094                               |\n\nOn pages 274 to 275 there is a detailed reconciliation from underlying earnings to net earnings, including pre-tax amounts and additional explanatory notes.

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet\n\nNet cash 1 reduced by $5.8 billion in 2022, resulting in a net debt 1 position of $4.2 billion at 31 December 2022. This reflected $11.7 billion returned to shareholders in the year, $3.0 billion 2 acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest of TRQ and $0.8 billion acquisition of the Rincon Lithium Project, partially offset by $9.0 billion of free cash flow and the $0.5 billion received from the sale of the Cortez royalty.\n\nOur net gearing ratio 1 (net debt/ (cash) to total capital) was 7% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: (3)%), see page 278.\n\nOur total financing liabilities excluding net debt derivatives at 31 December 2022 (see page 191) were $12.3 billion (31 December 2021: $13.5 billion) and the weighted average maturity was around 11 years. At 31 December 2022, approximately 77% of these liabilities were at floating interest rates (85% excluding leases). The maximum amount within non-current borrowings maturing in any one calendar year is $1.5 billion, which matures in 2024.\n\nWe had $8.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents plus other short-term cash investments at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $15.2 billion).\n\n## Provision for closure costs\n\nAt 31 December 2022, provisions for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were $15.8 billion (31 December 2021: $14.5 billion). The principal movements during the year were the result of a remeasurement of underlying cash flows, including the effect of inflation. This was recorded as an increase to mining properties for current operating sites ($0.5 billion) and as a charge to profit for legacy sites ($0.5 billion). Also contributing to the increase in the provision was amortisation of discount ($1.5 billion) which includes the effect of higher inflation in the year. These increases were partly offset by utilisation of the provision through spend (-$0.6 billion) and a weaker Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and South African rand against the US dollar (-$0.7 billion).\n\nOf the $15.8 billion in provisions, $11.6 billion relates to operating sites and $4.2 billion is for legacy sites. Remaining lives of operations and infrastructure range from one to over 50 years with an average for all sites, weighted by present closure obligation, of around 15 years (2021: 16 years).\n\nThe provisions are based on risk-adjusted real cash flows using a realrate discount rate of 1.5% to reflect obligations at the present value of cash flows on 31 December 2022 terms.\n\nIn 2023, we expect to utilise around $0.8 billion of the provisions as we advance our closure activities at Argyle, ERA, Gove alumina refinery and legacy sites.\n\n## Our shareholder returns policy\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining an appropriate balance between cash returns to shareholders and investment in the business, with the intention of maximising long-term shareholder value.\n\nAt the end of each financial period, the Board determines an appropriate total level of ordinary dividend per share. This takes into account the results for the financial year, the outlook for our major commodities, the Board's view of the long-term growth prospects of the business and the company's objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet. The intention is that the balance between the interim and final dividend be weighted to the final dividend.\n\nThe Board expects total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40% to 60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the cycle. Acknowledging the cyclical nature of the industry, it is the Board's intention to supplement the ordinary dividend with additional returns to shareholders in periods of strong earnings and cash generation.\n\n## 60% payout ratio on the ordinary dividend\n\n|                                                                 | 2022 US$ bn   | 2021 US$ bn   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Ordinary dividend                                               |               |               |\n| Interim                                                         | 4.3           | 6.1           |\n| Final                                                           | 3.7           | 6.7           |\n| Full-year ordinary dividend                                     | 8.0           | 12.8          |\n| Payout ratio on ordinary dividend                               | 60 %          | 6 0   %       |\n| Additional returns                                              |               |               |\n| Special dividend announced in July 2021, paid in September 2021 | n/a           | 3.0           |\n| Special dividend announced in February 2022, paid in April 2022 | n/a           | 1.0           |\n| Total cash returns to shareholders declared*                    | 8.0           | 16.8          |\n| Combined total as % of underlying earnings                      | 60 %          | 7 9   %       |\n\nWe determine dividends in US dollars. We declare and pay Rio Tinto plc dividends in pounds sterling and Rio Tinto Limited dividends in Australian dollars. The 2022 final dividend has been converted at exchange rates applicable on 21 February 2023 (the latest practicable date before the dividend was declared).

        "page_content": "## Innovation through collaboration\n\nFor 150 years, we have been looking for new and better ways of doing things. This drive for continuous improvement is at the core of our purpose, but we cannot do it on our own. Together with our partners, we work on inventing new processes and technologies that can make mining safer, more sustainable and more efficient.\n\nMany of the challenges that lie ahead - from decarbonising our operations to improving productivity - will need new technologies and approaches, some of which have not yet been developed. Nurturing an innovative culture will be essential to helping us meet these challenges.\n\n## Working safer and smarter\n\nWhile empowering our people to find more efficient ways of working, we always treat their health and safety as our most important priority. In 2022, we introduced several new technologies to help us work safer and smarter. For example, we are trialling agile autonomous haul trucks together with Scania at our Channar operation in Western Australia's Pilbara region. We use these driverless vehicles in a simulated load and haul cycle environment, and they offer a range of potential safety, productivity and decarbonisation benefits. Channar is the first active site for these vehicles, with plans for a future transition to electric-powered vehicles.\n\nWe are also trialling battery-powered electric vehicles underground at our Kennecott operations. As well as offering significant productivity and decarbonisation opportunities, these vehicles also protect the health and safety of our people by minimising exposure to potentially dangerous diesel emissions and particulates underground. We will use the lessons we learn at Kennecott as we continue these trials on other sites in 2023.\n\nWe are also partnering with other suppliers, including Komatsu, Caterpillar and Volvo, to progress options for electrified vehicles, with further trials to take place in the coming years. In parallel, we are also working to reduce emissions from our fleet today using biofuels. In 2022, we began trials of renewable diesel at our Boron and Kennecott operations.\n\nWe are also focusing on learning and implementing lessons from our own pockets of excellence. In 2021, we launched the Safe Production System (SPS) to improve how we operate our assets, manage performance and help our people innovate. Through SPS, we are drawing on data more efficiently to understand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Look inside a mine of the future TM\n\nAutonomous drills, water carts and fuelling units are just a few examples of how innovation is shaping our iron ore operations at Gudai-Darri in Western Australia, our most technologically advanced mine yet. Learn more on our website about how we are partnering with global leaders in technology to ensure Gudai-Darri remains at the pioneering edge of mining well into the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nvisit www.riotinto.com/news/stories/look-inside-future-mine.\n\nasset health, maintenance scheduling and bottleneck solutions. We have started to see improved production efficiency, safety and engagement at the sites where we have deployed SPS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout SPS, see our website.\n\nOur Pioneer Portal, used to source innovative solutions to current business challenges, continued to deliver new ideas. In 2022, we launched six new challenges through the portal, focused on developing our people, reducing our environmental footprint, recovering value from our water, and progressing our work towards net zero. We received more than 200 submissions from across the world, resulting in 20 new partnerships underpinned by more than $40 million in research and development (R&D) funds, significantly reducing our discovery and development cycles.\n\n## Product innovation\n\nWe have continued our focus on applied innovation and R&D to address technical barriers that may help unlock new orebodies or significantly reduce environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts. These include:\n\n- -Copper: advancing commercialisation opportunities for our proprietary Copper Heap Leach technology via the Nuton TM Venture and a range of existing product group and exploration deployment options.\n- -Rincon: developing process technical support for progression of our operations, including a focus on water recovery and recycling and process optimisation.\n- -Aluminium: progressing ELYSIS, our joint venture with Alcoa, supported by Apple and the Governments of Canada and Quebec. ELYSIS is developing a breakthrough technology that eliminates all direct\n\ngreenhouse gases from the aluminium smelting process. Construction of the first commercial-scale prototype cells of ELYSIS TM inert anode technology is underway at our Alma smelter, and they are expected to become operational in 2023.\n\n- -Green steelmaking: development of the innovative BioIron TM process and hydrogenbased steelmaking, and creating a deeper understanding of Pilbara ore characteristics for performance in a green steelmaking world.\n- -Technology leveraging: fast-tracking ideas from our R&D network. Driving R&D ideas and delivery for growth, closure and ESG priorities with a specific focus on resolving technical barriers within critical metals extraction, future net zero flowsheets, mineralised carbon sequestration, dry stack tailings, zero carbon ilmenite smelting, dry processing and hydrogen-based processing.\n- -Capability investments: planning to add battery materials and mineralised carbon sequestration testing facilities.\n\n## Accelerating the net zero transition\n\nWe cannot realise a decarbonised world without significant progress in technology solutions. Partnering with suppliers, industry and other organisations to reduce emissions, as well as growing and developing new markets, remain key components in our decarbonisation journey. Through these partnerships, we are switching to renewable power, electrifying processing and, where possible, running electric mobile fleets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout how we are working to decarbonise the steel and aluminium value chain, see our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.",

Where do you think we need to focus our future efforts?\n\nOur job is to find solutions for the big challenges across our business. These include health and safety, ESG, carbon abatement, productivity, and growth in critical metals and minerals. We play an important role in introducing new science, technology and expertise to solve problems and identify opportunities; accelerating delivery and facilitating technology and R&D solutions; and collaborating with our product groups to build our internal skills and create an environment where R&D can flourish. We will continue to focus on these areas in 2023.\n\n## Through an R&D lens, what critical metals and minerals are we focusing on for the future?\n\nOur products are critical to the energy transition. We will need more aluminium and copper as we electrify the world and replace fossil fuels, and this will also drive steel growth. Other minerals and metals will be required to supply the emerging technologies of the energy transition. Battery systems require lithium and nickel; fuel cells require scandium, cerium, zirconium and yttrium; green hydrogen electrolyzers need iridium, ruthenium, and titanium; flow batteries need vanadium; our 5G phones need gallium and indium; electric vehicles need neodymium and praseodymium; and next generation solar panels will need tellurium. We are focusing on resetting the carbon footprint of today's products; valorising waste or extracting critical minerals in our waste streams; and growing copper, lithium and other battery minerals. We have already had some success: at Kennecott we have extracted tellurium, at Sorel-Tracy, we have extracted scandium and we are finding more opportunities to extract other critical minerals and find uses for our wastes.\n\n## Some of our new initiatives and partnerships in 2022\n\n- - We have set up a new China Technology and Innovation Centre (CTIC) to harness China's leading expertise in research, technology and innovation to help solve some of our operational and business challenges.\n- - We are exploring carbon storage potential with a team of climate innovation and research leaders. This three-year project, backed by the US Department of Energy's ARPA-E innovation challenge, will explore new approaches to safely and permanently store carbon as rock.\n- - We have become a member of the Australian Remote Operations for Space and Earth organisation, to support our development of new flowsheets for critical minerals.\n- - We have become a member of the MIT Future Energy Systems Initiative, the MIT Industrial Liaison Programme, and the MIT Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Programme in Western Australia in partnership with Woodside.\n- - We are partnering with BHP on new tailings technology that could significantly increase water recovery from mine tailings.\n\nThrough our venture capital fund, we have invested in technology and start ups to help solve critical business challenges. These include:\n\n- -Lumo Analytics: rapid characterisation of exploration drill core using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.\n- -TerraCO 2 : supplementary cementitious materials from copper tailings to lower the carbon dioxide emissions of cement and concrete production.\n\n## What is our biggest challenge with the energy transition?\n\nSpeed. The energy transition will require a herculean effort from governments, society and industry to pull this off. An average mine takes eight years of permitting before it can be brought onstream. We also need to transform our flowsheets so that the supply we bring onstream does not have a disproportionate social and environmental cost - the technologies required for this still need much work. We need to create whole supply chains to support these efforts.\n\nWe know we cannot do this alone, and we need to bring the outside world in. This is a crucial time to partner with universities, companies and our competitors to create a lower carbon future and bring in new ideas and technologies as well as development partners to build and install infrastructure in our operations.\n\n## Who are some of these partners and what do they specialise in?\n\nThere are many examples, so I will just touch on what we are doing with start up companies and universities. We created a small venture capital fund to invest in start ups, and we are impressed with the science and technologies being explored. Some of these concepts sound a bit like magic, but to give you a snapshot they involve pulling CO 2 out of the air, low-carbon cementitious products, using biomass as a reductant, aluminium ion batteries and using renewable power to convert water into hydrogen. We have formed several partnerships with universities.\n\n## Where do you see our biggest opportunity?\n\nWe are researching, developing and implementing so many new technologies to supply the minerals we need for the energy transition as well as reducing the carbon, waste and water footprint of our operations. This may result in new business streams in CO 2 capture and hydrogen, and the sale of what we once thought of as waste, as products.\n\n- -CarbonCapture Inc. : direct air capture technology to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\n- -Aymium: production of high quality, low impurity BioChar to support the net zero CO 2 reduction projects for ilmenite smelting.\n- -Electric Hydrogen: low-cost green hydrogen production to decarbonise iron and titanium smelting, alumina calcination and steel making.\n- -ElectraLith: electrically-driven filtration process to extract lithium from brine.\n- -NanoOne: innovative cathode materials manufacturing for batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage.",

Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment; capitalised evaluation costs; and purchases less sales of other intangible assets.\n- 4.  Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nWe achieved a number of operational records across the mine and rail system in the second half of 2022, due to operational improvements and the ramp-up of Gudai-Darri. In the year, we safely commissioned our Pilbara projects, despite challenging conditions with COVID-19, labour and supply chain disruptions. The focus now moves to the next tranche of mines starting with Western Range.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $18.6 billion was 33% lower than 2021, due to lower prices ($8.8 billion), following the 25% drop in the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines adjusted to an FOB basis. Higher sales volumes were achieved from our portside operations in China, which improved underlying EBITDA by $0.6 billion. We also increased resourcing to support the ramp-up at Gudai-Darri and targeted investment in pit health and asset maintenance across the Pilbara.\n\nThis additional investment, together with rising input prices, including diesel price escalation and labour, resulted in 2022 Pilbara unit cash costs of $21.3 per tonne (excluding COVID-19 costs of $0.4 per tonne). This compared with $18.6 per tonne in 2021 (excluding COVID-19 costs of $0.5 per tonne).\n\nOur Pilbara operations delivered an underlying FOB EBITDA margin of 68%, compared with 76% in 2021, largely due to the change in the iron ore price.\n\nWe price the majority of our iron ore sales (77%) by reference to the average index price, for the month of shipment. In 2022, we priced approximately 10% of sales with reference to the prior quarter's average index lagged by one month with the remainder sold either on current quarter average, current month average or on the spot market. We made approximately 72% of sales including freight and 28% on an FOB basis.\n\nWe achieved an average iron ore price of $97.6 per wet metric tonne on an FOB basis (2021: $132.3 per wet metric tonne) across our product suite. This equates to $106.1 per dry metric tonne, assuming 8% moisture (2021: $143.8 per dry metric tonne), which compares with the monthly average Platts index for 62% iron fines converted to an FOB basis of $109.8 per dry metric tonne (2021: $146.9 per dry metric tonne). The 3% lower realised price compared to the Platts index was due to lower average grades, partially offset by higher premiums for lump products.\n\nSegmental revenue for our Pilbara operations included freight revenue of $2.2 billion (2021: $2.7 billion).\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of $14.0 billion was $5.2 billion lower than 2021, with lower pricing partly offset by a monetisation of working capital. Free cash flow of $11.0 billion was $4.1 billion lower than 2021 due to the factors above, partially offset by a $1.0 billion reduction in capital expenditure to $2.9 billion following completion of brownfield mine replacement tie-in projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Last year, we continued to strengthen our partnerships with local communities and Traditional Owners, and made substantial progress in securing the future of our Pilbara business.'\n\n## Simon Trott\n\nChief Executive, Iron Ore\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead the full interview with Simon on our website.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nPilbara operations produced 324.1 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 272.9 million tonnes), 1% higher than 2021. Shipments of 321.6 million tonnes (Rio Tinto share 270.8 million tonnes), in line with 2021, included 35.5 million tonnes of lower grade SP10 products, 11% of shipments, on a 100% basis (2021: 11% of shipments).\n\nPerformance improvements continued across the system and we achieved a number of operational records in the second half across the mine and rail system. System inventories at the end of December were healthy, including strong blasted stocks, mine stocks and port stocks.\n\nOur iron ore portside sales in China were 24.3 million tonnes in 2022 (14.0 million tonnes in 2021). At the end of the December, inventory levels were 7.8 million tonnes, including 5.5 million tonnes of Pilbara product. In 2022, approximately 80% of our portside sales were either screened or blended in Chinese ports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 32-33.",

This reduction includes improvements in processing efficiency, increased use of hydroelectric boilers in refining instead of natural gas boilers, and reduced aluminium production at the Kitimat smelter, which continues to ramp up after a strike in 2021. The 2022 emissions intensity of our managed Atlantic smelters, powered by hydroelectricity, was 2.21Mt CO 2 e per tonne of aluminium. Our Vaudreuil alumina refinery has one of the lowest carbon footprints of any metallurgical alumina refinery in the world today.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nabout our decarbonisation efforts in the Aluminium product group, see our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.\n\n## $3.7bn\n\nUnderlying EBITDA (2021: $4.4bn)\n\n## 21.1Mt\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (equity Mt CO 2 e) (2021: 21.7Mt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSegmental revenue (2021: $12.7bn)\n\n15,000\n\nEmployee numbers (2021: 14,000)\n\n## Safety\n\nIn 2022, we continued to progress in our safety maturity journey, expanding our focus on contractors and integrating health and environment into the daily leadership rituals. Our Pacific assets significantly improved their all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) to a best-ever of 0.27, while a difficult year at Kitimat contributed to an AIFR in the Atlantic of 0.43, for an overall AIFR of 0.35 in 2022 compared to 0.33 in 2021. The number of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) in our business remained steady in 2022 (29), and we remain committed to reducing these risks. The work programme we commenced in 2021 to address overhead crane asset maintenance continued into 2022, and the number of PFIs relating to falling objects has reduced by 47% compared to 2021. We will be integrating the learnings from the 2022 safety maturity model assessments to strengthen our front-line risk assessment and critical risk management programme, as well as our Safe Production System to reduce fatality risk, prevent injuries and stabilise our operations. The occupied building programme helped remove over 2,000 of our workforce from buildings with exposure to process hazards in our business. This programme is a significant step forward for process safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nabout our global health and safety initiatives, see pages 57-58.",

Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment; capitalised evaluation costs; and purchases less sales of other intangible assets. It excludes equity accounted units (EAUs).\n- 2.  Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nStrong pricing in the first half fell away sharply in the second, which, together with rising energy and raw materials costs, led to a significant margin squeeze on our Aluminium business and a 16% decrease in underlying EBITDA for the year as a whole. Underlying EBITDA margin fell nine percentage points, but remained robust for the year at 29%.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $3.7 billion benefited from higher product premiums for primary metal in addition to the stronger pricing environment for primary metal and alumina in the first half. However, this was offset by higher coal prices and costs for key materials such as caustic soda, coke, pitch and anodes, leading to an increase in cash costs for alumina and primary metal. We achieved an average realised aluminium price of $3,330 per tonne, 15% higher than 2021 ($2,899 per tonne).\n\nAverage realised aluminium prices comprise the LME price, a market premium and a value-added product (VAP) premium. The cash LME price averaged $2,703 per tonne, 9% higher than 2021, while in our key US market, the Midwest premium duty paid, which is 57% of our volumes (2021: 55%), increased by 12% to $655 per tonne (2021: $584 per tonne). Our VAP sales were stable at 50% of the primary metal we sold (2021: 50%) and generated product premiums averaging $431 per tonne of VAP sold (2021: $230 per tonne).\n\nOur conversion of underlying EBITDA to cash remained relatively strong, with net cash generated from operating activities of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $1.7 billion.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nBauxite production of 54.6 million tonnes was 1% higher than 2021, despite equipment reliability issues at Weipa and Gove in Australia.\n\nWe shipped 38.0 million tonnes of bauxite to third parties in 2022, 1% higher than 2021. In 2022, segmental revenue for bauxite increased 9% to $2.4 billion this includes freight revenue of $635 million (2021: $462 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'2022 has been a year of transition for our Aluminium business. We sustained investment to strengthen the health of our assets, and announced several growth projects including AP60, Alma's billet centre and early stage expansions in recycling.'\n\n## Ivan Vella\n\nChief Executive, Aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead the full interview with Ivan on our website.\n\nAlumina production of 7.5 million tonnes was 4% lower than 2021. The refineries in the Pacific (Yarwun and Queensland Alumina Limited) were impacted by a range of challenges in 2022, including unplanned outages and equipment reliability issues. COVID-19 absenteeism impacted production in early 2022 but eased in the second half. Production at the Vaudreuil refinery in Quebec remained stable.\n\nAs the result of Queensland Alumina Limited's (QAL) activation of a step-in process following sanction measures by the Australian Government, we have taken on 100% of capacity for as long as the step-in continues. We are using Rusal's 20% share of capacity under the tolling arrangement with QAL. This additional output is excluded from our production results as QAL remains 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal.\n\nAluminium production of 3.0 million tonnes was 4% lower than 2021, due to reduced output at our Kitimat smelter in British Columbia, Canada and Boyne smelter in Queensland, Australia. The rate of pot restarts at Kitimat picked up in the fourth quarter and Boyne smelter cell recovery efforts continued on plan. Recovery at both smelters is progressing, with full ramp-up expected to be completed during the course of 2023. All of our other aluminium smelters continued to demonstrate stable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 32-33.",

The decrease in emissions was mainly driven by the closure of the coal-fired power plant at Kennecott in 2019, with the balance of power met by the utility with commensurate renewable energy certificates. Escondida also completed its repowering in 2021, sourcing green power for its operations. In 2022, we considered long-term sustainable green power solutions, and how to address emissions from diesel haulage with ongoing trials and studies.

It excludes EAUs.\n- 4.  Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings (product group operations) excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nUnderlying EBITDA was down 40% to $2.4 billion, with $0.7 billion of the reduction a result of lower copper prices, particularly in the second half of the year. An anticipated decrease in by-product sales volumes (particularly lower gold in concentrate at Oyu Tolgoi), rising cash costs, higher energy prices and an increase in exploration and evaluation expenditure also impacted EBITDA in 2022. Underlying EBITDA margin remained strong at 49%.\n\nOur copper unit costs, at 163 cents per pound, increased by 81 cents, largely driven by the decline in by-product credits, together with rising input and higher labour costs, following the implementation of new labour laws in Mongolia and a new five-year collective bargaining agreement at Kennecott.\n\nWe generated $1.4 billion in net cash from operating activities, a 48% decrease on 2021, from the same drivers as underlying EBITDA, together with a smaller increase in working capital compared to 2021.\n\nNegative free cash flow of $0.3 billion reflected the significant investment of $2.0 billion in our projects, an increase of 26% on 2021. This mainly related to the ongoing development of the Oyu Tolgoi underground project, underground growth projects at Kennecott and the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nMined copper production, at 521 thousand tonnes, was 6% higher than 2021 due to higher grades at Kennecott and Escondida, partly offset by lower grades and recoveries at Oyu Tolgoi as a result of planned mine sequencing.\n\nThe 4% increase in refined copper production to 209 thousand tonnes mainly reflected a furnace failure in 2021 at Kennecott which resulted in the smelter being offline for the majority of the fourth quarter of 2021. Unplanned maintenance was required in the fourth quarter of 2022 in our anode furnaces, leading to extended downtime and continued poor anode production.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi underground project\n\nA comprehensive agreement was reached with the Government of Mongolia on 25 January 2022, resetting the relationship between the partners, increasing the value the project delivers for Mongolia, and allowing underground operations to commence.\n\nIn 2022, Rio Tinto and the Government of Mongolia remained focused on supporting Oyu Tolgoi to reach the sustainable production milestone, and continuing progress on the remaining measures contained in Mongolian Parliamentary Resolution 103.\n\nAt the end of 2022, a total of 19 drawbells had been fired. Drawbell progression accelerated as a result of improvement initiatives implemented by the Oyu Tolgoi teams, bringing projected first sustainable production from Panel 0 forward to the first quarter of 2023 (previously first half of 2023).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'2022 has been a year of achievements. In January we reached an agreement with the Government of Mongolia, started the undercut at Oyu Tolgoi and completed the acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources in December. In Guinea, we signed the infrastructure joint venture with our Chinese partners and the Government to unlock Simandou.'\n\n## Bold Baatar\n\nChief Executive, Copper\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead the full interview with Bold on our website.\n\nAt the end of December, shafts 3 and 4 sinking had reached 378 metres and 507 metres below ground level respectively. Operational safety sinking pauses have caused some delays against the 2022 reforecast 5 to shaft sinking. Final depths required for shafts 3 and 4 are 1,148 and 1,149 metres below ground level respectively. Construction of conveyor-tosurface works continued with civil scope of works completed and other contractors mobilised to site.\n\nStudy work for Panels 1 and 2, which are required to support the ramp-up to 95,000 tonnes of ore per day, remains on track to be completed in the first half of 2023. It will incorporate any ventilation impacts due to the shaft 3 and 4 delays as a result of COVID-19 restrictions and reprioritisation of the mobilised workforce over the course of 2022.\n\nOn 16 December, we completed the acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ) for consideration of approximately $3.1 billion 6 , simplifying ownership of the Oyu Tolgoi mine, significantly strengthening our copper portfolio, and demonstrating our long-term commitment to the project and Mongolia. We now hold a 66% direct interest with the remaining 34% owned by the Government of Mongolia through Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi. This is allowing us to focus fully on strengthening our relationship with the Government of Mongolia and moving the project forward with a simpler and more efficient ownership and governance structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 32-33.\n\n- 5.

On 17 November 2021, Rio Tinto's interest in Diavik increased from 60% to 100%. Production and financials reflect this from 1 November 2021.\n\n- 4.  Underlying return on capital employed (ROCE) is defined as underlying earnings (product group operations) excluding net interest divided by average capital employed.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn 2022, we benefited from strong market conditions for titanium dioxide pigment and borates, partially offset by a weaker market for iron ore pellets and concentrate, albeit off record levels. We also saw higher diamond prices compared with 2021, following a pandemic-related build up of demand and low inventory levels.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA of $2.4 billion was 7% lower than 2021, primarily due to inflationary pressures, energy price increases and Rincon evaluation costs. This was partially offset by prices and higher EBITDA in relation to the increased ownership in Diavik.\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities of $1.5 billion was 6% higher than 2021, while free cash flow of $0.8 billion was 7% higher, reflecting a higher EBITDA cash conversion supported by lower dividends paid to holders of non-controlling interests at Iron Ore Company of Canada.\n\n## Review of operations\n\nProduction of iron ore pellets and concentrate at IOC was 6% higher than 2021 due to the successful deployment of the Safe Production System (SPS) at the concentrator, which was completed in the year. Record performance metrics were achieved in the year, including monthly records for concentrate production and total material moved in the second quarter. Planning for SPS deployment at the pellet plant commenced in December.\n\nTitanium dioxide production of 1.2 million tonnes was 18% higher than 2021 due to community disruptions at Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa in 2021, and continued improved performance of operations at Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations, Canada. Nationwide loadshedding of electrical power caused production constraints at RBM in late 2022.\n\nBorates production was 9% higher than 2021, with strong production rates, higher grades and improved equipment reliability.\n\nOur share of carats recovered was 21% higher than 2021, from our increased share of production since taking 100% ownership of Diavik in November 2021, partly offset by lower carats recovered due to lower grades.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our capital projects and future growth options, see pages 32-33.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We're working hard in the critical minerals space.

To optimise the process and recoveries, we also continue to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate from raw brine from the existing pilot plant operating at site. We are now advancing detailed studies for the full scale of operation and progressing exploration activities to further understand Rincon's basin and brine reservoir. We continue to engage with communities, the province of Salta and the Government of Argentina to ensure an open and transparent dialogue with stakeholders about the works underway.",

We are the primary interface with markets, customers and suppliers local, regional and global - through a network of over 20,000 active suppliers and almost 2,000 customers.\n\nAs the key interface to the market, our Commercial team works very closely with our customers and suppliers. We generate insights and opportunities to unlock the full commercial potential across our value chains, always striving to find better ways to provide the materials the world needs.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nIn 2022, we recorded zero fatalities and a 0.14 all-injury frequency rate (AIFR), compared to 0.07 for 2021. As we continue to navigate COVID-19 impacts, we have maintained our strong focus on critical risk management and prevention programmes across areas of greatest exposure.\n\nWe continue to work on our safety performance within our maritime fleet of 17 owned, and more than 230 contracted, vessels. Although we had no fatalities on our managed operations in 2022, tragically, there was a fatality on one of the non-managed marine vessels and, in a separate incident, another mariner suffered a permanent disabling injury. We are determined to improve maritime safety for our industry and we are working closely with our shipping partners, industry associations and other mining companies.\n\n## Customer partnerships\n\nIn our mission to find better ways to provide the materials the world needs, we partner with customers to work towards our shared goal of enabling the world's transition to a low-carbon future. In 2022, some initiatives included:\n\n- - Signing a separate memorandum of understanding (MoU) with both the Ford Motor Company and Volvo Group, each of which leverages our advantage as a one-stop multi-commodity supplier for sustainable products and solutions in the low-carbon transition. Ford will also explore becoming the foundational customer for our Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina to support its production of electric vehicles.\n- - Strengthening our low-carbon product offering with aluminium produced by ELYSIS TM emissions-free smelting technology, used by Apple (in their iPhone SE), and Corona Canada (in Canada's first specially marked, low-carbon aluminium cans).\n- - Leveraging START TM , our blockchain technology, to provide over 110 customers with 14 key ESG metrics.

As the largest shipper by tonnage in the world, we have a role to play. We are actively exploring partnerships to achieve our commitment to have net zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030, while taking actions to reduce emissions through efficiency initiatives and alternative fuels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nvisit www.riotinto.com/news/stories/decarbonising-the-high-seas.\n\nconsumers can see how products were made from the mine to their hands and make more informed choices on what they buy.\n\n- - Signing a separate MoU with both Shougang Group and Salzgitter Flachstahl, and continuing significant partnerships with Nippon Steel Corporation, BlueScope, and Baowu to develop low-carbon solutions for the steel value chain. We have also successfully proven the effectiveness of BioIron TM , a low-carbon iron-making process using raw sustainable biomass and microwaves.\n\n## Supplier partnerships\n\nIn the areas where we operate, we work hard to partner with and develop local businesses so they can share in our success. In 2022, we increased our spend with Indigenous suppliers in Australia by 40% from 2021 to A$565 million.\n\nWe also actively seek partnerships with our suppliers to reduce our own emissions. In 2022, we have:\n\n- - Continued our partnership with Scania to develop smaller and more agile autonomous haul trucks. In April 2022, we launched new trials on Scania's 40-tonne-payload autonomous mining trucks and quickly reached a key milestone of driverless operation in a simulated load and haul cycle environment. These trucks will require less energy and have a smaller infrastructure footprint.\n- - Signed an MoU with Volvo Group to work towards decarbonising our operations through piloting Volvo's sustainable autonomous hauling solutions.\n- - Joined the First Movers Coalition, a global initiative to help commercialise zero-carbon technologies by harnessing purchasing power and supply chains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our decarbonisation initiatives, see our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.\n\n## Snapshot of the year\n\n## $55.6 billion\n\nGroup consolidated sales revenue\n\n(2021: $63.5bn)\n\n2,600\n\nsea voyages\n\n2,100\n\ncontracts under management (2021: 2,100)\n\n## $20.7 billion\n\nin contestable spend globally (2021: $17.9bn)\n\n106,000\n\nshipments by rail, truck and containers\n\n## A$565 million\n\nspent with Indigenous suppliers in Australia, an increase of 40% from 2021 (2021: A$400m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincrease in spend with Chinese suppliers from 2021\n\n(2021: 44%)",

In 2021, we committed to reduce our CO 2 emissions intensity in shipping by 40% by 2025, five years ahead of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) deadline. To date, we have achieved a 30% intensity reduction in conventional fuel use from an IMO 2008 baseline through operational and technical measures such as weather routing, schedule optimisation and vessel modifications.\n\nWe have a year-long biofuel trial underway and we recently received the first of nine dual-fuelled liquified natural gas-powered vessels that we are introducing into our fleet. We continue to support new technologies and industry collaborations that will contribute to the industry's low-carbon transition, including through our strategic partnerships with the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping and the Global Maritime Forum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our shipping decarbonisation efforts, see our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.\n\n## Commercial insight and outlook\n\nEconomic growth and commodity demand started positively in 2022 as the world continued its recovery from the pandemic downturn. However, the large supply shock brought about by the war in Ukraine led to energy security concerns and exacerbated inflationary pressures, while a resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns and outbreak in China affected business activities and consumer confidence. High inflation prompted many countries, led by the US, to aggressively tighten monetary policy to re-establish price stability. These risks are carried over to 2023, and the global economy is expected to slow further. China's economic recovery from COVID-19 remains volatile, while the Chinese Government provides support to stabilise the economy, especially in the infrastructure and real estate sectors.\n\n## Iron ore\n\nFollowing three consecutive years of growth to a 2021 all-time high, iron ore demand simultaneously contracted in China and the rest of the world for the first time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Chinese property market slump continued to worsen, while extended COVID-19 restrictions impacted China's steel demand, exerting downward pressure on prices. There were also headwinds to ex-China iron ore demand, which was negatively impacted by sharply higher energy and raw materials costs to steel producers. Iron ore prices were more resilient and market fundamentals tighter than consensus expectations because the demand weakness was offset, and at times outweighed, by even lower supply.\n\nCombined shipments from major producers were effectively unchanged year-on-year in 2022, but remained below the volume delivered in 2018. Meanwhile, a combination of price-related and other external factors reduced overall seaborne supply. These included small-scale, high-cost producers who discontinued operations when prices declined below break-even points; supply disruptions due to the war in Ukraine; and India's decision to impose export tariffs on iron ore. Despite the introduction of a range of supportive policies and growth targets, China's domestic iron ore production also declined year-on-year in 2022 following a number of safety accidents and the imposition of operating restrictions.\n\n## Aluminium\n\nThe aluminium price rose in the first quarter of 2022 to a multi-year high, on expectations of stronger demand outlook and Russian aluminium supply cuts, both of which eventually did not materialise. The price then fell to its low point in the third quarter as fears of a global economic slowdown set in, and Chinese aluminium production rose on restarts and commissioning of new capacity. Chinese aluminium domestic demand also weakened due to COVID-19 restrictions, especially in the building and construction sector. However, the aluminium price stabilised in the fourth quarter as a result of a high level of smelter curtailments in Europe given high energy costs, and curtailments in Southern China given drought conditions and low hydropower levels.\n\nGlobal aluminium inventories remained low and the market deficit provided support to the aluminium price. Elevated carbon raw material and energy prices resulted in the industry facing a significant margin squeeze in the second half of 2022.\n\n## Copper\n\nAfter a record quarterly average price was reached in the first quarter of 2022, copper prices trended down from late April, as a wave of uncertainty surrounding the global economy and China's COVID-zero policy weighed on the prospects for copper demand. The average price in the third quarter was the lowest quarterly average since the fourth quarter of 2020. Global visible copper cathode inventories fell to multi-year lows, providing support to prices.\n\nMine supply growth, while remaining positive, stalled in 2022 due to issues such as water availability, geological and geotechnical challenges, and slower project ramp-ups contributing to a higher level of disruptions to production. Mine supply growth is expected to return over the 2023 to 2024 period, as committed projects get underway after earlier delays.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Commercial is the key interface between our assets and the markets, our customers and suppliers.

Nevertheless, prices were supported by tight global high-grade supply. Inventories remained low in 2022 but are expected to grow in 2023. Structural factors relating to orebody depletion remain favourable for high-grade TiO 2 feedstock and zircon markets.\n\nLithium prices remained elevated on strong demand. The electric vehicle market continues to experience strong growth, supported by government policies.\n\nThere was strong buying activity for borates in 2022 due to persistent supply tightness, resulting in prices closing the year at a decade high.\n\nIn diamonds, prices started 2022 with strong growth but have cooled amid weakening demand. Global diamond supply remains stable, which is resulting in some inventory accumulation through the supply chain.",

To do this, our priorities and performance must align with society's expectations, which are constantly evolving. So each year we complete a sustainability materiality assessment to understand which issues and topics matter most to, and have the greatest impact on, our stakeholders and our business.\n\nWe gather information on sustainability topics and their impact from internal and external stakeholders and employees via interviews, surveys, and reviews of publicly available materials. We ask them what is important now, and what they think will be important in five to ten years. The insights we gather through this process also guide our approach to sustainability and how we report externally.\n\n## What is important now\n\nOur internal and external stakeholders are broadly aligned on the four most important sustainability topics. Climate change is the most important issue and includes concerns about emissions reduction and how resilient and adaptable our business is to cope with climate-induced change. Respecting human rights; cultural and heritage site management; and health, safety and wellbeing are other highly material topics. For our business, the safety and wellbeing of our people remains our highest priority (see page 57). Business integrity, governance, and local community relations are important topics as we continue to build trusting relationships with our partners, employees and host countries.\n\n## Lower materiality\n\n## Medium materiality\n\nHigher materialityMateriality to Rio Tinto\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What will be important in the future\n\nOur internal and external stakeholders feel that climate change will only continue to increase in importance over the next decade, as will geopolitical uncertainty, the impact of technology, respecting human rights, business integrity and governance, supply chain transparency and end-to-end materials management. Other emerging critical topics include water management due to the reliance of local communities and mining operations on an increasingly scarce resource, and biodiversity due to the increasing impacts of climate change. Managing all these well will be integral to our social licence to operate.\n\n## Reporting our performance\n\nOur sustainability materiality assessment records the threshold at which an issue or topic becomes important enough for us to report on externally. The importance of a topic is based on the significance of its impact on stakeholders. A sustainability materiality assessment differs from financial materiality, which may use financial metrics or other quantitative analyses to determine what would be considered a significant or material impact.\n\nAs a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), we commit to reporting on our sustainability performance against Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and implementing the ICMM Performance Expectations (PEs).\n\nThe ICMM Mining Principles framework focuses on the implementation of systems and practices related to a broad range of sustainability areas. In line with the ICMM's requirements, all 29 Rio Tinto managed operating and refining assets completed an ICMM PEs self-assessment before 30 September 2022. A self-assessment was also completed for Rio Tinto Corporate. These assets met the requirements in the areas of ethical business practice, decision making and stakeholder engagement.",

        "page_content": "## Community engagement and social investment\n\nEffective communities and social performance (CSP) is fundamental to our business. Without the support of the communities where we live and work, we cannot operate. We aim to contribute to a shared future and positive legacy by developing lasting relationships with people, learning about and supporting their goals and aspirations, avoiding or mitigating adverse impacts, and respecting different cultures and connections to lands and waters.\n\nWe are finding better ways to work with communities and Indigenous peoples, particularly in how we protect heritage. We are moving to a model of co-management of land and waters, and we are updating our agreements to deliver more enduring socioeconomic, heritage and environmental outcomes. This, in turn, delivers greater certainty for mine development.\n\nOur CSP teams span our entire business and work in partnership with communities to understand how the work we do affects their lives, culture and heritage. By doing so, we can optimise benefits and reduce negative impacts, both for local communities and our business. Our teams include people who have a range of expertise, from archaeologists, anthropologists, social scientists and economic development experts to human rights specialists and operational leaders. While these teams lead our technical activities, our social licence is the responsibility of all employees. Everyone has a role to play in our engagement with, and contribution to, host communities and society more broadly.\n\nOur CSP and site teams are also starting to work with Indigenous communities to explore opportunities for them to participate in our climate initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our climate initiatives, see our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n## Strengthening social performance\n\nWe continue to strengthen our social performance governance, capacity and capability. In 2022, we launched our revised Communities and Social Performance Standard. It applies to all managed operations globally and will help us work thoughtfully, responsibly and transparently. It provides clear direction on what success looks like and the minimum standard expected across our global operations.\n\nIn 2022, we also launched the 2022 to 2027 Group CSP vision, goal and strategic framework, which will guide our activities over the next five years and help improve our performance. Our CSP vision is to respect and enable communities to realise their goals and aspirations and create long-term shared benefits.\n\nWe continue to build internal capability and collaboration across our teams working in CSP, Indigenous Affairs and Cultural Heritage. In 2022, we held two global conferences in Brisbane and Montreal for more than 260 CSP employees to explore complex technical issues and share good practice and learnings. These conferences also offered the opportunity to engage with civil society organisations, investors and academia on emerging CSP trends and practice. As we evolve our approach to co-design and co-management, we continue to listen to the wealth of knowledge that resides both inside and outside our business.\n\n## QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM)\n\nIn 2022, QMM worked together with national and local authorities, representatives of the communities and Traditional Owners to address complaints raised by members of the local communities through a grievance management process. Throughout the year, the parties continued to work together to find equitable and sustainable solutions and we will continue to work closely with the community on these issues in 2023. Despite the challenges at QMM, we are implementing initiatives to strengthen\n\nour collaboration with the community. One example is our village nursery project, which generates income for the community that is supporting the rehabilitation of the area surrounding the Mandena mine. In 2022, QMM invested over $550,000 to support rehabilitation activities, producing 300 tonnes of compost and providing 1,500,000 seedlings used for commercial tree planting, ecological restoration, greening of the area around Mandena and an offset plantation near the future mining lease in Ambatoatsinana. Community associations are the input suppliers, and some community members are also employed. More than 400 households have benefited from QMM's rehabilitation activities. In addition, QMM will increase its spending on its Corporate Social Responsibility Policy over the next three years to implement development projects in full collaboration with the communities and for the benefit of all local community members.\n\n## Resolution Copper project, Arizona, US\n\nAt our Resolution Copper project in Arizona, we continue to strengthen relationships with local communities and Native American tribes by deepening our engagement and partnership support.\n\nWe recognise the enduring historical connection Native American tribes have with the land at, or near, the proposed mine and we have partnered with the Tonto National Forest Service and Native American tribes to develop a programme to train tribal members in archaeological surveys and to help us identify sites of special significance to tribes. For more information, see resolutioncopper.com\n\nThe project is going through comprehensive and independent social and environmental regulatory reviews. The US Forest Service (USFS) published the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in January 2021. In March 2021, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) directed the USFS to retract the FEIS, which allowed the agency to undertake further review and consultation.\n\n## Communities and social performance targets\n\nIn 2022 we finalised a new suite of CSP targets, following the end of our previous target reporting period (2016-2021). The new targets will help us monitor progress towards the core objectives of our CSP Group strategy. We have transitioned from having individually set and defined local asset targets to common global targets, which will allow us to see progress across the Group as well as for individual assets. Our assets will continue to maintain local targets and metrics, developed in consultation with local communities, in addition to the global targets. Reporting will evolve over the next 12 months.\n\n| Communities and social performance targets 2022-2026                                                                           | Reporting status                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| By 2026, all sites to co-manage cultural heritage with communities and  knowledge holders.                                     | Progress will be evaluated through a co-management maturity  assessment currently in development for reporting from 2023. |\n| Year-on-year increase in contestable spend sourced from suppliers local to  our operations.                                    | Baseline included in the  2022 Sustainability Fact Book  for: - Rio Tinto Group                                           |\n|                                                                                                                                | - Product groups                                                                                                          |\n|                                                                                                                                | Progress against target reported annually from 2023.                                                                      |\n| By 2026, 70% of total community investment to be through strategic, outcomes- focused partnerships.                            | Progressive reporting through roll-out of the social investment  strategy and framework in 2023.                          |\n| By 2024, 100% of employees in high human rights risk roles to complete yearly  job-specific and general human rights training. | Progressive reporting with 2022 focus on training development  and role mapping.                                          |\n| By 2026, 100% of employees to complete yearly general human rights training.                                                   |                                                                                                                           |",

In addition to implementing environmental and social impact mitigation measures, our teams are working with local communities to enhance social infrastructure, deliver livelihood restoration initiatives and build community resilience.\n\nRecognising the cumulative impacts that will occur as a result of the development of Simandou, we are also working with our infrastructure and joint venture partners to ensure the consistent application of internationally recognised environmental and social performance standards across the entire project footprint. We are also working towards raising local capacities to maximise local content. Engaging with local entrepreneurs and investing in training and development of local capacities is key to optimise benefits to our host communities.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi, Mongolia\n\nWe focus on long-term sustainable development in Mongolia, increasing transparency in our business processes and building trust with local communities through community investment and local employment. In 2022, local employment at Oyu Tolgoi increased by 25% from January to September as a result of a comprehensive recruitment process and local talent development.\n\nSince 2015, Oyu Tolgoi has made a yearly contribution of $5 million to a Development Support Fund (DSF) - administered jointly by Oyu Tolgoi and the community - for community programmes and projects in the Umnugovi aimag. In 2022, after reaching $38.9 million, the fund invested in constructing a community school, a kindergarten, and a health care centre, increasing accessibility to quality educational and healthcare services for community members and creating more than 480 permanent jobs. The DSF also funded the Gobi History and Nature Museum, which opened in May 2022. It has already benefitted tourism in the region by attracting more than 28,000 people, and it is playing an important role in protecting and promoting Mongolian cultural heritage.\n\nWe continue to engage with local communities through the Khanbogd Tripartite Council (TPC). In 2022, we focused on herder sustainable livelihood, student scholarships and pastureland water access.\n\n## Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin\u00e9e SA (CBG), Guinea\n\nCBG is a bauxite operation in Guinea owned by Halco Mining Inc. (51%) and the Guinean Government (49%). Halco is a consortium comprised of Rio Tinto (45%), Alcoa (45%) and Dadco Investments (10%). Rio Tinto participates on the boards of Halco and CBG, with representation on various shareholder oversight committees. Through our Board and committee roles, we monitor and support CBG's approach to environmental protection, community issues and human rights. We are aware of the concerns regarding access to\n\nland and water, and the pace of livelihood restoration programmes as well as concerns regarding CBG's stakeholder engagement. In 2022, sustainability advisory committees at Halco and CBG levels met regularly, strengthening our oversight and providing support to CBG for the improvement of CBG's social and environmental practices, including for the development of an ongoing human rights due diligence process. Both the Halco and CBG advisory committees are closely following CBG's response to a complaint made to the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO). The mediation process facilitated by the CAO has conducted seven sessions in 2022 and through a collaborative approach the parties made important progress towards an agreement on the improvement of community access to water. Halco continues to participate in the mediation process as an observer, alongside the IFC.\n\n## Panguna mine, Bougainville, Papua New Guinea\n\nThe Panguna mine was operated by Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL), majority-owned by Rio Tinto, for 17 years from 1972 until 1989, when operations were suspended due to a civil war, which lasted until 1998. In 2016, Rio Tinto transferred its 53.83% majority shareholding in BCL to the Autonomous Bougainville Government (ABG) and the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Government for no consideration, enabling the ABG and PNG to hold an equal share in BCL of 36.4% each.\n\nIn September 2020, the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) filed a complaint against Rio Tinto on behalf of 156 Bougainville residents with the Australian National Contact Point (AusNCP) regarding the Panguna site.\n\nIn 2021, as an outcome of the AusNCP engagement, a joint committee of stakeholders, the Panguna Mine Legacy Impact Assessment Committee, was formed to oversee a detailed independent assessment of the Panguna mine to identify and better understand the environmental and human rights impacts of the mine. The Committee is chaired by an independent facilitator with representatives from the ABG, the Independent State of PNG, clan leaders and landowners, local communities, Rio Tinto, BCL and HRLC. It has met regularly since its formation.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee commissioned the Panguna Mine Preparatory Phase Report to inform priority areas for the Impact Assessment. Completed in 2022, the report identified risks of potential failure of the levee at the former Main/Pump station, and potential flooding events along the Kawerong and Jaba river. On behalf of the ABG, Tetra Tech Coffey completed on-the-ground investigations in October 2022 and will present findings to the ABG who will determine next steps.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee selected and endorsed Tetra Tech Coffey to complete phase 1 of the independent environmental, social and human rights Legacy Impact Assessment. The Legacy Impact Assessment began in December 2022 and will provide all parties with a clearer understanding of the impacts, so that together we can consider the best way forward.\n\n## Jadar lithium-borates project, Serbia\n\nWe continue to believe that the Jadar lithiumborates project in Serbia can contribute to enhancing the electric vehicle supply chain ecosystem in Serbia. We continue to explore options with all stakeholders on how to progress this world-class opportunity to the highest environmental standards.\n\n## Group-wide COVID-19 fund\n\nIn 2021, we committed $25 million to help the communities where we live and work respond to the pandemic. Our assets led the implementation of the fund, supporting grassroots communities across three pillars: response, recovery, and resilience. The remaining funds were allocated in April 2022 to support communities in Madagascar, Mongolia, Serbia and South Africa. More information is available on our website.\n\n## Social contribution\n\nSupporting economic opportunities for our host communities and regions is a key priority for us and we strive to employ local people, buy local products and engage local services. In 2022, our total voluntary global social investment was $62.6 million, covering a wide range of social and economic programmes. In 2022, we spent $2.7 billion with suppliers local to our operations, which is 14.5% of our total contestable spend.\n\n## 88 Indigenous rangers\n\nacross 12 Pilbara Traditional Owner groups will be supported to deliver cultural land management, through our contribution of A$11.8 million over five years towards Ranger Programs.\n\n## Humanitarian support\n\nthrough $5 million donated to humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. We also contributed A$271,530 through our global employee appeal.\n\n## Residents of 10 towns\n\nin the Shire of Ashburton and City of Karratha in the Pilbara region of Western Australia will realise improved social outcomes over the next ten years through our A$75 million contribution.\n\n## Indigenous history\n\nwill be preserved through a two-year archaeological partnership with the Cheslatta Carrier Nation in Canada, to better understand the history of Indigenous communities and human migrations.\n\n## 1,000 people\n\nin remote rural communities will have access to mobile health care for the first time, through our contribution of $375,000 to Clinic Mobile des Oubli\u00e9s, a Guinean social enterprise.\n\n## 550,000+ students\n\nin elementary and high schools in Quebec will have access to a free homework helpline and learning website through our contribution of C$1 million over three years.\n\n## Culturally safe care\n\nfor mothers and children will be made available to First Nations and Inuit patients and families at Sainte-Justine through our C$500,000 donation.",

Significant updates since this report are summarised below under three areas of interest: relationships, governance and process, and leadership and inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee our 2022 Communities and Social Performance Commitments Disclosure Report on our website.\n\nIn 2023, we will repeat the feedback process with Traditional Owners in the Pilbara. This will provide a three-year longitudinal perspective on our relationships. In parallel, we will undertake a project to design and pilot a community feedback process for host communities where we operate globally.\n\n## Relationships\n\nWe have changed the way we engage with Indigenous communities. We are progressively working more closely in partnership with Indigenous peoples across our operations to preserve and protect cultural heritage. We are moving to a model of co-management to ensure Indigenous voices are heard as part of our decision making.\n\n## Remedy agreement with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation\n\nIn November 2022, we agreed with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation to create the Juukan Gorge Legacy Foundation as part of a remedy agreement relating to the destruction of the rock shelters at\n\nJuukan Gorge in the Pilbara region of Western Australia in May 2020. Financial support will be provided to the Traditional Owner-led foundation to progress major cultural and social projects, including a new keeping place for storing important cultural materials. The agreement forms part of our commitment to remedy and rebuild the relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee our website.\n\n## Updated agreement with the Yindjibarndi people\n\nAs part of our commitment to modernise our relationships with Traditional Owners, in November 2022, we signed an updated agreement with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation. The agreement aims to provide better social and economic outcomes for future generations and reflects our commitment to create opportunities for Yindjibarndi people to participate in our operations. The agreement also includes support for Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation to develop community, commercial and cultural projects and programmes to fulfil its aspirations of self-determination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee our website.\n\n## Pilbara Cultural Land Management project\n\nAs part of our A$11.8 million investment over five years into Ranger programs in Western Australia, we announced a partnership with the Pilbara Cultural Land Management Project (PCLMP) in October 2022. The PCLMP will enable 12 Pilbara Traditional Owner groups to take part in training programmes to help develop tools that support cultural, heritage and environmental mapping, monitoring and management. The project will provide greater employment opportunities and ongoing social and cultural benefits. For more information, see our website.\n\nWe are also investing in developing and diversifying individual Ranger Programs across the Pilbara, partnering with Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, Karlka Nyiyaparli Aboriginal Corporation and Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation. The Aboriginal-led Ranger Programs provide connection to culture, opportunities for healing and strengthening families, and holistic support to achieve generational change.\n\n## Working with Indigenous communities in Canada\n\nWe continue to collaborate with Indigenous groups in Canada to implement agreements. We have 11 active long-term impact benefits/ participation agreements, and three potential agreements are in discussion. Our agreements include areas such as training and employment procurement, land and water management, joint environmental monitoring and community investment. We are also working in partnership with Indigenous communities to look at how we protect and preserve cultural heritage.\n\nAt our Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories, we are working with Indigenous partners to develop criteria for water quality to ensure that water is healthy and safe from a western science perspective and from a traditional cultural use perspective. This initiative values both western science and traditional knowledge and it will be evaluated equally by the Wek'\u00e8ezh\u00eci Land and Water Board and the regulator. It is part of a co-management regulatory regime to ensure future traditional use of the local land and water. In the northern part of British Columbia, we have announced a significant archaeological research project together with the Cheslatta Carrier Nation. The project will excavate sites of remarkable cultural and historical significance that could date back more than 10,000 years.\n\n## Economic contributions (US$ million)\n\n|                                                      | 2022    | 2021     | 2020    | 2019    | 2018    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Profit after tax for the year                        | 13,076  | 22,575   | 10,400  | 6,972   | 13,925  |\n| Underlying earnings                                  | 13,275  | 21,380   | 12,448  | 10,373  | 8,808   |\n| Underlying earnings per share (US cents)             | 819.6   | 1,321.1  | 769.6   | 636.3   | 512.3   |\n| Net cash generated from operating activities 1       | 16,134  | 25,345   | 15,875  | 14,912  | 11,821  |\n| Capital expenditure 2                                | (6,750) | (7,384)  | (6,189) | (5,488) | (5,430) |\n| Net (debt)/cash                                      | (4,188) | 1,576    | (664)   | (3,651) | 255     |\n| Consolidated sales revenue                           | 55,554  | 63,495   | 44,611  | 43,165  | 40,522  |\n| Employment costs                                     | (6,002) | (5,513)  | (4,770) | (4,522) | (4,728) |\n| Payables to governments 3                            | (9,313) | (12,789) | (8,224) | (7,175) | (7,217) |\n| Amounts paid by Rio Tinto                            | n/a 4   | (13,334) | (8,404) | (7,635) | (6,575) |\n| Amounts paid by Rio Tinto on behalf of its employees | n/a 4   | (1,486)  | (1,353) | (1,284) | (1,342) |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "In the Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region of Quebec, we announced the signing of an agreement with Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation in December 2022. This agreement - named Kuessilueu, which means 'the wind is turning' in Nelueun - is the start of a collaborative process that will bring Pekuakamiulnuatsh and Rio Tinto representatives together in a co-designed approach to identify priorities and recommendations on governance, jobs and training, business opportunities, cultural heritage, environment, partnerships, and energy transition. The agreement will involve a large group of people and aims to create a movement, with each participant becoming an agent of change in their respective area. As part of this agreement, an Indigenous awareness programme will be launched for our employees in the region.\n\n## Governance and process\n\nDuring 2022, we continued to revise our standards, systems and processes to ensure we are working responsibly to avoid and minimise impacts and risks to our operations, people and communities.\n\n## Australian Advisory Group\n\nWe have established an Australian Advisory Group (AAG) to provide guidance on current and emerging issues, and better manage policies and positions that are important to both Australian communities and our broader business. The group continues to refine its scope and procedures for providing high-quality advice to the Chief Executive Australia and the Executive Committee.\n\n## Our cultural heritage risks\n\nWe have now operationalised the set of controls that manage our cultural heritage risks, with an emphasis placed on understanding the control performance at a local level. Our global Communities and Social Performance Area of Expertise continues to provide subject matter advice and support to our assets to strengthen the risk assessment processes across our business.\n\n## Independent cultural heritage management audit\n\nIn 2020, we engaged Environmental Resources Management (ERM) to undertake an independent cultural heritage management audit across all our sites. Phase one of the audit was completed in mid-2022 and focused on 20 audits across our Australian assets. Field work for phase two was completed in December 2022 and focused on 17 audits across our non-Australian operations.\n\nPhase one of the audit found that the changes introduced over the past two years have improved on-ground management. For example, a number of assets globally are progressing projects with community partners to document intangible cultural heritage values. This includes methodologies such as constellation mapping and training on new methods for recording oral histories. The report identified four areas for improvement: managing water as a cultural resource, managing artefacts, integrating data, and continuing to build our team of experienced cultural heritage practitioners.\n\nA summary of audit findings from phase one and two will be released at the end of the first quarter in 2023. Based on the recommendations, we will then work on a response plan in consultation with our cultural heritage teams and cultural heritage knowledge and rights holders.\n\n## Leadership and inclusion\n\nWe are evolving our culture to encourage a mindset and behavioural shift at all levels of our organisation. We have a programme of work in progress that focuses on advancing respect for the peoples and cultures on whose land we live and work, which links closely to the work we are doing as part of the Everyday Respect initiative.\n\nWe continue to increase the number of Indigenous leaders in our business and develop our cultural competency. Reducing the barriers for Indigenous employees in our business and increasing cultural intelligence will help us become a better operator and a more inclusive workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nsee page 59.\n\nIn October 2022, we launched an internal protocol for the use of Indigenous cultural and intellectual property in Australia to ensure we follow appropriate processes when commissioning or reproducing Indigenous design or artwork within our business and engaging in Indigenous art and design projects. This will continue to be rolled out throughout 2023.\n\n## Truth and reconciliation in Canada\n\nWe continue to create learning opportunities for our people in Canada to raise awareness about the history, culture and rights of Indigenous peoples. During National Indigenous History Month, we held a series of events focusing specifically on Indigenous women. In September, we celebrated National Truth and Reconciliation Day and hosted a panel focusing on tangible ways to promote reconciliation and create a more inclusive and culturally safe work environment.\n\n## Addressing employment barriers in Canada\n\nIn addition to raising awareness, we have been focusing on identifying and addressing some of the recruitment opportunities and barriers for Indigenous peoples, and particularly Innu First Nations candidates. We prioritised eastern Canada in 2022 and took a number of actions. We established employment and training committees in partnership with Indigenous job placement agencies and we revised our recruitment process, including hiring criteria, pre-employment checks and verification processes. These changes resulted in 31 new Indigenous hires.\n\n## Indigenous participation\n\nIn 2021, our Iron Ore product group developed an Indigenous participation strategy to attract and develop Indigenous employees and promote a culturally safe working environment. Throughout 2022, we continued to make significant progress. We have:\n\n- - Enhanced our recruitment processes.\n- - Updated our employment programme to remove obstacles to employment and provide training and development opportunities for Indigenous peoples.\n- - Delivered a training programme to increase the cultural knowledge of non-Indigenous employees.\n- - Implemented an Indigenous participation dashboard to ensure leaders are enabled to make informed choices on improvement initiatives.\n- - Enhanced our Indigenous Talent Review programme, which in 2022 saw 23 participants from a cohort of 151 promoted to roles of Supervisor or above.\n\n## Indigenous leadership in Australia As at end of 2022\n\n46\n\nIndigenous leaders in our workforce (A-H band) (November 2020: 6)\n\n## 39%\n\nWomen in our Indigenous leader cohort (A-H band)\n\n## 1,549\n\nIndigenous employees in our workforce (equivalent to 6.6%)\n\n## 87%\n\nCultural connection programme participation among A-E leaders\n\n## 16%\n\n## Indigenous graduates in cohort\n\n(26 graduates in total)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 94\n\nIndigenous professionals participating in our cultural onboarding programme\n\n## 17\n\nIndigenous leaders graduating from RioInspire (Emerging Indigenous Executive Leaders)",

        "page_content": "## Health, safety and wellbeing\n\nCaring for one another is one of our values it is part of who we are and the way we work, every shift, every day. Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nWe have now exceeded four years without a fatality. Although this is an important milestone, it is not one we take for granted. While we recognise the commitment made by all our employees and contractors to make us a safer company, we continue to believe all incidents and injuries are preventable and focus on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks.\n\nAlthough we had no fatalities on our managed sites in 2022, we are saddened by the loss of a mariner on board a non-managed chartered vessel, and a permanent disabling injury suffered by another mariner in a separate incident, also on a non-managed chartered vessel. We remain determined to improve maritime safety for our industry through a multi-year programme to identify, manage and eliminate risks in the marine supply chain.\n\nWe continue to see serious incidents at our own operations. Our main risks relate to falling objects, fall from height, and vehicles and driving.\n\nOur all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) remained stable at 0.40, compared to 2021. We continue to see a disparity between the number of injuries among employees and contractors, so we remain focused on including contractors in our safety culture.\n\nCritical risk management (CRM) remains our primary fatality elimination tool by helping ensure that critical controls are in place and working where there is a fatal risk. In the last year, we continued to simplify our critical risk content, particularly for risks of rail impact or collision, mooring and drowning.\n\nTo address risks related to vehicles and driving, in late 2021 we made significant changes to the Group procedure for mass transportation, a component of our vehicles and driving Group standard. These changes included the mandatory implementation of in-vehicle monitoring systems, and fatigue and distraction technology in all buses we operate, as well as increased safety feature requirements for vehicles purchased after January 2022. To tackle risks associated with falling objects, in the last year we also worked to improve the asset integrity of overhead cranes across our operations.\n\nIn 2023, we will re-focus our attention on CRM to address the frequency of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs) across all critical risks. We will work to enhance the quality and impact of verifications - used for checking that the right critical controls are in place for each task - and we will use the data we collect to understand early trends, so that we can intervene before incidents occur.\n\nAcross our business, our commitment remains on advancing our safety culture. The safety maturity model (SMM), introduced in 2019, was enhanced in 2022 to provide our leaders and their teams with clear guidance on managing health and environment risks, as well as on integrating contractors in a way that helps keep them safe. We also directed our efforts towards better understanding the felt experience of our workforce and the effectiveness of safety rituals.\n\nTo help leaders understand and apply the SMM enhancements, we ran a series of 'teach-in' sessions covering the key changes, including maturity indicators (systems, symbols, behaviours and felt experience), the importance of mindsets in supporting behaviour and culture change, and the critical steps in the assessment process, including scoring. We also evolved our assessor training programme to reflect these enhancements, as well as to improve assessors' understanding of the model and consistency in its application.\n\nAs a result of the enhancements we introduced to the SMM, we also stepped up the requirements for what defines each level of safety maturity across our business. With the inclusion of health, environment and contractors, we have reset our expectations on how to lead for both physical and psychological safety, while also caring for the environment.\n\nAlthough we know this will be a multi-year journey, we are encouraged by the results of the 2022 assessments, which deepened our understanding of the safety culture at each site. In addition, feedback received from site teams confirmed that the assessments provided actionable insight into where to focus to become a safer workplace.\n\n## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nMental health is a core part of our safety culture. We have a responsibility to support the wellbeing of our people, beyond the traditional areas of health and safety, and we are committed to creating a work environment that is free from psychological harm.\n\nWe understand that our employees' mental health can be impacted by psychosocial risks at work, so we continue to strengthen our psychosocial risk management. To support an environment where everyone feels safe, respected and included, we are progressing all 26 recommendations from the Everyday Respect Report , with a focus on training leaders in building psychological safety and becoming upstanders, rectifying any unsafe facilities and building plans to make our facilities more inclusive, and providing a more people-centric response to support those impacted by harmful behaviours and disrespect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the Everyday Respect initiative, see page 16.\n\nWe are a member of the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) Psychosocial Risk Management Working Group, chaired by MCA and industry partners, to improve the understanding and management of psychosocial risk within our industry.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our work to help leaders recognise psychosocial hazards; assess the risks; and implement, evaluate and monitor effective controls, just as for any other health or safety risk. We also continued embedding our mental health framework to raise awareness of mental wellbeing, reduce stigma and increase the capacity of our leaders to recognise and support individuals experiencing mental illness.\n\nAligned with our commitment to give our employees the tools and skills they need to support their mental health, we continue to provide and promote the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP), our mental health toolkit and our global Peer Support Programme, which includes more than 1,500 peer supporters worldwide. We also support our people through our domestic violence support programmes, which cover 100% of employees.\n\nWe continued to support global mental health campaigns such as R U OK? Day and World Mental Health Day. In October 2022, we held our mental health week to support mental wellbeing in the communities where we operate and encourage our people to look out for one another. We ran a programme of activities that included our first-ever global calls dedicated to mental health. The full communications programme reached employees via leader and peer supporter conversations, Yammer posts, intranet articles and a combination of four live and recorded webinars on topics such as resilience and the connection between mental health and menopause. We further encouraged conversations by sharing employees' stories and experiences with mental health, and having senior leaders and members of our Executive Committee share their personal reflections and commitment to mental health.\n\n## Our safety maturity model\n\nMuch of the success of our safety culture is a result of the implementation of our SMM, now in its fourth year. The SMM, as our blueprint for safety, brings together the best practices from across our business in leadership and engagement, learning and improvement, risk management and work planning. Together, these practices define how we can lead for physical and psychological safety. Since implementing the model, we have evolved our focus from verifying systems and rituals to assessing the impact of the model on people's mindsets. We believe all our employees and contractors should feel that they can work without injuring themselves, speak up and make decisions to keep themselves safe. We have evolved the SMM accordingly, including the way we train our assessors and perform assessments at our sites.",

        "page_content": "## Occupational health\n\nIn 2022, we recorded a higher number of new occupational health illnesses compared to the previous year, with 69 (2021: 61 1 ), in line with our increased focus on medical assessments. These assessments are a key requirement in ensuring and maintaining our employees' fitness for work, addressing legislative requirements and managing risk profiles. In the last year, we began work to standardise and simplify such assessments to help improve our health performance.\n\nWe also ran two workshops for our global health practitioners to share learnings, best practice and recent technology developments.\n\nIn 2022, we continued the post-pandemic return to normal for occupational and industrial hygiene sampling. This includes analysis of noise, airborne particulates, gas and other contaminants that can lead to adverse health effects for our employees and contractors. We also reinstated our health surveillance audiometry, spirometry and biological monitoring - to proactively identify potential occupational illnesses.\n\nThe data collected over 2022 allows for semi-quantitative assessments of risk and identifies areas where we can implement or enhance control measures. Each product group worked on identifying projects within their assets which, with the support of the Areas of Expertise, will be designed, developed and implemented to reduce exposures for our employees and contractors.\n\nWe also updated and simplified our guidance notes on Occupational Exposure Limits and Occupational Hygiene Statistics to simplify these processes. This will help our teams manage and report hygiene risks.\n\nRecognising the need to improve the transparency and detail of our health data, we performed a Group Internal Audit in 2022. We are now implementing the audit recommendations by working to improve the reporting of our data. These recommendations include reviewing gaps in guidance, updating our existing guidance to address these gaps, re-training our health practitioners and improving the available consolidated reports to enable further insights.\n\nRe-doubling our efforts on delivering products that safeguard the environment, health and safety of our communities and end-consumers, we brought together colleagues from our product groups, Health, Environment and Commercial teams to develop a roadmap for future-proofing our product stewardship.\n\n## HSES transformation\n\nThe Health, Safety, Environment and Security Transformation Programme, implemented across five sites, is simplifying the way we work and increasing the value we get from the information we collect, ultimately making our business safer. We are piloting the core modules at Bell Bay and Dampier Port in Australia, and Boron in the US. At SaguenayLac-St-Jean in Quebec, Canada, we are piloting three of the environment modules: air, water and greenhouse gas. Global deployment of the core modules will start in 2023.\n\n- 1.

We continue to monitor the situation and follow safety precautions to reduce exposure to the virus and protect our people, contractors, their families and the communities where we operate. We also continue to offer support to those impacted by COVID-19, including long COVID and any psychological impacts.",

        "page_content": "## Talent, diversity and inclusion\n\nOur culture is a key enabler of our purpose. It will make us a better partner and allow us to attract and retain the people we need to unleash the full potential of our business. We are finding better ways to support and engage our people, which means creating an environment where everyone feels comfortable being themselves, has the courage to speak up if something is not right and listens to each other with care and curiosity.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nAt the beginning of the year, we reported the findings and recommendations from an independent review of our workplace culture to better understand, prevent and respond to harmful behaviours across our global operations. The Everyday Respect Report proposed 26 recommendations, all of which we are implementing. This is just one way we are evolving our culture to create a safe, respectful and inclusive workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the immediate actions we have taken in response to the Everyday Respect Report , see page 16.\n\n## Continuing to listen and learn\n\nTo help us understand how our people feel about the company and our direction, we conduct two annual Group-wide employee engagement surveys. Close to 36,000 employees participated in our latest survey in October 2022, and our employee satisfaction score (eSAT) 1 improved from 71 in 2021 to 73. The feedback shows that the changes we are making are moving us in the right direction.\n\nEvolving a culture takes time and commitment. Continuing to focus on the evolution of our culture will remain a key priority for everyone in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our work to evolve our culture, see page 16.\n\n## Building an inclusive and diverse workforce\n\nHaving an inclusive and diverse workforce is a competitive advantage. It will enable us to find better ways to do things and ensure that we reflect the communities where we work.\n\nIn 2022, we extended our family-friendly policies by updating our global standard for paid parental leave to meet differing family needs, ensuring that all new parents are eligible for 18 weeks minimum paid parental leave.\n\nWe have been working on increasing the representation of Indigenous employees in our business and ensuring they have a stronger voice. In 2022, we partnered with the Australian Graduate School of Management at the University of New South Wales to deliver the RioInspire programme (formally known as the Emerging Indigenous Executive Leaders programme). The programme has been tailored to focus on developing executive-ready Indigenous leaders who will have an influential role in shaping the future of our business. The first group of Rio Tinto Indigenous leaders completed the globally recognised, six-month programme in April 2022.\n\nWe continue to focus on the representation of women across all levels in our business. In 2022, we increased the representation of women in our workforce from 21.6% to 22.9%. We hired 2,982 women in the last 12 months, an 18% increase on 2021.\n\nWe continued to evolve our award-winning graduate programme in 2022 and recruited our biggest cohort yet with 265 graduate roles. Of these, 53.2% were women and 36% were from nationalities where we are building new businesses 2 . In Australia, 15% of the graduate intake (up from 10% in 2021) and 2.2% of our vacation student programme (down from 15% in 2021) were Indigenous.\n\n## Developing our people\n\nWe continue to invest in our people. Through the Safe Production System (SPS), we are empowering people to develop and share sustainable, best-practice solutions to define how to work safely and optimally. In 2022, our focus has been on upskilling our people with technical knowledge on best practices and encouraging the right mindsets and behaviours to better engage our people. To set us up for a continued successful and rapid rollout of SPS in 2023, we have now trained 20 Mindset and Behaviour Coaches and 218 Change Partners, and certified 61 leaders in SPS deployments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout SPS, see page 34.\n\nWe know leaders play a critical role in shaping our culture. In 2022, we continued to invest in personal leadership development through the Voyager programme. And as at 31 December 2022, more than 300 senior leaders have experienced the Voyager journey.\n\nWe have also expanded our technical expertise and now have 130 people formally recognised as a technical RioExpert TM through our RioExcel TM programme. And in partnership with LinkedIn Learning, we launched an online energy and climate change curriculum for employees who want to understand more about how they can contribute to reducing both Rio Tinto's and their personal carbon footprint.\n\n- 1. eSAT (employee satisfaction) is a measure of how happy employees are to work at Rio Tinto (average score).\n- 2.  Identifying with a nationality is not mandatory. More than 48% of our graduates have not formally reported a nationality.\n- 3.  Women % increase is 1.37% rounded to 1.4%.\n- 4.  myShare, our global employee share plan.\n\n## Ensuring equality through pay equity\n\nEnsuring that employees with similar skills, knowledge, qualifications, experience and performance are paid equally for the same or comparable work is intrinsically linked to our commitment to inclusion and diversity.\n\nOur equal pay gap, the primary lens we use when assessing gender pay, measures the extent to which women and men employed by our company in the same location and performing work of equal value receive the same pay. In 2022, we further reduced our equal pay gap compared to 2021, which is now 1% in favour of men.\n\nGender pay gap is a measure of the difference between the average earnings of women and men across the Group (excluding incentive pay), regardless of role, expressed as a percentage of men's earnings. In 2022, our gender pay gap was just over 1% in favour of women, consistent with previous years.\n\nWe are committed to eliminating any residual pay inequities based on gender or other non-legitimate dimensions of difference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our commitment to pay equity, see our website riotinto.com/payequity\n\n## 52,000\n\nworkforce of employees and contractors, an increase of 9.8% since 2021 (47,000), excludes non-managed operations.\n\n## 11,062 new hires\n\nof which 4,317 were contractors becoming permanent employees (2021: 7,895 new hires of which 3,098 were contractors).\n\n## 22.9% women\n\nin our workforce, an increase of 1.4% 3 since 2021 (21.6%).

We are working on improving our human rights performance, strengthening a range of areas to help prevent our involvement in adverse human rights impacts, and providing for, or cooperating in, remediation when we identify that we have caused or contributed to harm.\n\nIn 2022, we revised our Human Rights Policy to advance our human rights performance in line with our business objectives and values and to meet external commitments and emerging regulatory requirements. The updated policy reflects emerging human rights areas including just transition, human rights defenders and human rights due diligence. It also reiterates our commitment to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the IFC Performance Standards, the UN Global Compact's ten principles, the Maritime Labour Convention, the ICMM Mining Principles, and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (Voluntary Principles).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our security and human rights work programme, see our annual Voluntary Principles Initiative Report , published on our website.\n\nOur Group Internal Audit (GIA) team reviewed the design of our modern slavery controls and presented summary observations and opportunities to the Sustainability Committee in October 2022. The internal audit identified opportunities to enhance management of third-party risks across non-financial domains (including modern slavery); to improve governance over the management of modern slavery risk; and to further improve Board visibility of modern slavery disclosures. This was part of a three-year phased approach to provide assurance across our human rights programme. We will implement the actions from the internal audit during 2023, and will continue to work with GIA to provide further assurance over our human rights governance framework.\n\nObtaining feedback from stakeholders, including receiving complaints or registering grievances, is a vital part of our human rights approach. Our stakeholders have access to myVoice, our confidential, anonymous and independently operated whistleblowing programme, through which human rights grievances can be reported.\n\n## Salient human rights issues\n\nConsistent with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, we acknowledge and respect Indigenous peoples' connection to lands and waters and commit to demonstrate progress towards, or achievement of, Free, Prior and Informed Consent of affected Indigenous communities across all phases of the asset lifecycle.\n\nAligned with the UNGPs, we continue to mature our processes and systems. For example, we identify the priority human rights issues that could severely impact people through our activities or business relationships. These issues, listed below, consider our operational footprint, value chain and external contexts and remain unchanged from 2021:\n\n- - Land access and use\n- - Indigenous peoples' rights\n- - Security\n- - Inclusion and diversity\n- - Community health, safety and wellbeing\n- - Workplace health and safety\n- - Labour rights (including modern slavery)\n- - Climate change and just transition (respecting human rights while transitioning to a low-carbon economy).\n\nIn 2022, several assets, including Simandou, Oyu Tolgoi and those in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia undertook risk assessments to review their priority human rights issues. These assessments provide assets with a more complete understanding of their risk context and are an important part of our commitment to implement the UNGPs. This work will continue into 2023.\n\n## Our business relationships\n\nIt is important that we address our potential involvement in human rights harm that may occur through relationships with our suppliers, customers and joint venture partners. We engage and collaborate with our business partners to advance respect for human rights in line with international standards, the UNGPs and our values.\n\nUsing a risk-based approach, we pre-screen potential business partners on human rights and require suppliers (including subcontractors) to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes respect for human rights.\n\nMore than 17,000 business partners completed baseline screening in 2022, and over 200 were escalated for human rights review, which is approximately a 60% increase compared to 2021. Our Commercial team also held conversations about human rights with several strategic suppliers at supplier relationship meetings.\n\nModern slavery provisions are included in our standard global supply contract and purchase order terms and conditions, as well as our marine chartering contracts. During 2022, we updated human rights considerations in our Supplier Code of Conduct and contributed to updating our Code of Conduct - The Way We Work, which was launched internally in February 2023. In 2023, we will perform a more detailed review of the Supplier Code of Conduct to further clarify our expectations of suppliers on human rights and other matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our human rights and modern slavery approach, see our annual Modern Slavery Statement on our website.\n\n## Capacity building on human rights\n\nIn 2022, we enhanced our in-house human rights expertise by establishing a dedicated human rights team within the Communities and Social Performance Area of Expertise.\n\nHowever, we also believe everyone in the business has a role to play in implementing our commitment to respect human rights.\n\nOur employees and contractors develop a better understanding of human rights issues through general and targeted training. In 2022, our training objectives were to demystify human rights and identify ways to integrate and operationalise human rights. We hosted 39 human rights workshops for our teams in Ethics and Compliance, the Business Conduct Office, Marine, Communities and Social Performance, as well as joint venture partners and other relevant stakeholders. We also launched an online learning module to raise awareness about modern slavery. This module is compulsory for our Commercial, Legal, Ethics and Integrity, and Communities and Social Performance Area of Expertise teams, but it is available to everyone in the business. Training feedback results indicated that over 90% of participants now understand what modern slavery is, how to report a concern and what we are doing to address risks.\n\nOur Marine team continued to develop their Seafarer Welfare and Safety Programme, which included dedicated human rights training for more than 108 marine officers and 77 seafarer crew members in the Philippines and India.\n\nWe have summarised our human rights training records in the 2022 Sustainability Fact Book .\n\nWe also participated in a number of collaborative human rights initiatives in 2022 and continued our external engagement with peers, civil society organisations, governments and others to help inform our approach to human rights management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout how we engaged with our key stakeholders, including civil society organisations, see pages 55-56.",

Among other initiatives, we focused on minimising the risks and the environmental footprint of our operations and working on our Climate Action Plan. We rehabilitated 16 square kilometres of land, and to help us reduce our carbon footprint, we set up a new team of specialists focusing on nature-based solutions.

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nThe low-carbon transition is at the heart of our business strategy. We are focused on growth in the materials that enable the transition, decarbonising our operations and partnering with our customers to decarbonise our value chains. Our operational emissions targets are ambitious: to reduce emissions by 15% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, reaching net zero by 2050. Our targets cover more than 95% of our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are aligned with 1.5\u00b0C pathways.\n\nThe Board approves our overall strategy, our policy positions and our Climate Change Report . The Board sets the 2025, 2030 and 2050 emissions targets and monitors performance against the targets and operational resilience. The Chair of the Board is responsible for our overall approach to climate change. The Board and the Risk Management Committee provide oversight of our principal risks and the Audit Committee monitors the overall effectiveness of our system of risk management and internal controls.\n\nThe Principal Risks and Uncertainties section in this report considers both physical climate risks and low-carbon transition risks. The Chief Executive is responsible for delivering the Climate Action Plan approved by the Board. Our approach to climate change and target execution considerations integrates risk management, portfolio reviews, capital investments, annual financial planning and government engagement.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nIn 2022, we worked towards our Climate Action Plan that our shareholders approved in a non-binding resolution at our annual general meetings. The low-carbon transition is complex: developing the technologies and implementing the major projects needed to decarbonise our business will take time. In 2022, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 30.3Mt CO 2 e (31.0Mt in 2021). This reduction of 7% below our 2018 baseline is primarily the result of switching to renewable power at Kennecott and Escondida in prior years, as well as lower than planned production from Kitimat and Boyne Smelter in 2022. We did not advance the actual implementation of our abatement projects as fast as we would have liked last year, so our capital expenditure on decarbonisation projects was $94 million, lower than we anticipated when we set our targets. Challenges have included late delivery of equipment, resourcing constraints impacting study progress, construction and commissioning delays, and project readiness.\n\n## Our '6+1' abatement programmes\n\nIn response, we established six abatement programmes, with dedicated people, to focus on the decarbonisation challenges that cut across our product groups: repowering our Pacific Aluminium Operations, renewables, ELYSIS TM , alumina process heat, minerals processing and diesel transition. We are building capability and gaining a deeper understanding of our decarbonisation challenge (both constraints and opportunities),\n\nand our related operational expenditure increased to approximately $140 million in 2022. As a result, we are better placed to deliver the complex and large-scale structural changes to our energy system needed to achieve our 2030 target.\n\nWe are progressing work towards 1GW of renewable power in the Pilbara. In 2022, we installed the first 34MW at Gudai-Darri and are planning investments of $600 million for solar, storage and transmission to deliver a further 230MW solar power and 200MWh storage from 2023 to 2026. Once fully operational, this will displace approximately 30% of our gas usage. In other locations, power purchase agreements can be a better option for us and in 2022 we signed a 130MW solar power purchase agreement for Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa.\n\nOur Pacific Aluminium Operations are in coal-based power grids and account for 28% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. A formal market Request for Proposals (RFP) was undertaken in June 2022 to support the development of large-scale wind and solar power to supply power to the Boyne smelter through the Queensland grid by 2030. This smelter requires 960MW capacity of reliable power to operate, which equates to at least 4GW of quality wind and solar power capacity with firming. We continue to work with the Queensland Government and energy providers to design a renewable energy solution for this smelter.\n\nOur Processing Centre of Excellence focuses on decarbonising our harder-to-abate operations in alumina, iron ore pelletisation and titanium dioxide. In 2022, we agreed to partner with the Government of Canada to invest $537 million (C$737 million) to reduce emissions by up to 70% at the Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations. This work supports technological innovations, including BlueSmelting TM , a new ilmenite smelting technology that allows us to reduce and eventually eliminate the use of coal in the process. We also continued our studies with the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and Sumitomo Corporation on the role of hydrogen in alumina refining.\n\nOur experience with our abatement projects and progress tracking suggests there will be delays, and that we will require greater use of offsets to achieve our 2025 target. We established one additional programme to increase our investments in nature-based solutions projects. If done well, these projects can play a substantial role in addressing carbon emissions and biodiversity loss, while also providing benefits to local communities. Our people working on these '6+1' programmes, along with our substantial investments in technology development, will drive the innovation and solutions needed to accelerate our low-carbon transition and ensure the long-term resilience of our business.\n\n## Decarbonising our value chains\n\nOur Scope 3 emissions were 584Mt CO 2 e in 2022 - over 1% of the global total. This is primarily from our customers in Asia processing our iron ore into steel and bauxite into aluminium, so our level of control is limited. Our approach to Scope 3 emissions balances ambition, pragmatism and our level of agency: it is focused on our most significant sources and is grounded in actions where we can have impact. While it is clear that we have a key role to play, we do not set an overall Scope 3 emissions target as we have limited ability to directly influence the production processes of our customers or their customers.\n\nIn 2022, we increased our engagement with nearly all our direct iron ore and bauxite customers and worked with them to optimise their current operations and to develop the low-carbon technologies needed to reduce emissions across our value chains. It is encouraging that this issue remains very high on the agenda when we meet our customers.\n\nAn inevitable structural shift toward green steel is underway. In the short term, the industry is predominantly focusing on blast furnace optimisation and we are working closely with customers to support their ambitions. In the medium term, the industry will move towards cleaner processing routes such as Direct Reduced Iron - Electric Arc Furnace (DRIEAF). Steelmakers will increasingly value higher grade ores with less impurities that are more energy efficient to process. Therefore, we are working in partnerships with customers, technology providers, universities and others to develop low-carbon technologies to process our iron ore into steel. This includes exploring DRI pathways using hydrogen and sustainable biomass. We are also working on options to beneficiate and upgrade our Pilbara ores to be better suited to low-carbon steel making technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Learn more\n\nabout these partnerships in our 2022 Climate Change Report at riotinto.com/climatereport.\n\nOur total Scope 3 emissions from shipping and logistics were 8.8Mt CO 2 e. Our shipping emissions intensity was 30% below our 2008 baseline, putting us on track to meet the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) decarbonisation goal of a 40% reduction in shipping emissions intensity by 2025, which is five years ahead of the IMO deadline.",

Please see GHG Emissions Methodology sheet for details of our approach to reporting Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions. Note that our 2022 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline do not include the additional equity share of the Oyu Tolgoi mine that was purchased in mid-December 2022. Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by Rusal. However, as a result of QAL's activation of a step-in process following the Australian Government's sanction measures, Rio Tinto is currently entitled to utilise 100% of the capacity at QAL, but paying 100% of the costs for as long as that step-in continues. Our 2022 equity emissions and our 2018 baseline include QAL emissions on the basis of Rio Tinto's 80% ownership. In 2022, the additional emissions associated with the step-in were 0.53Mt. Rusal has commenced proceedings challenging the validity of the step-in and the sanctions regime may change over time, such that the duration of the step-in remains uncertain. Historical Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been restated to reflect improvements in data quality.\n\n- 1. Historical information for copper equivalent intensity has been restated in line with the 2021 review of commodity pricing to allow comparability over time.\n- * We retired 10,000 offsets in 2022 as part of a trial carbon offset iron ore cargo with a steel producer in China.

We manage risk to minimise adverse environmental impacts from our operations and to sustain our shared ecosystems, planet and natural resources for future generations. In July 2022, the United Nations recognised 'the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment' as a human right, further underlining our responsibilities to people and the planet.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nAs a forum member of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), we are preparing to pilot the prototype risk management and opportunity disclosure framework at our Simandou site in Guinea. This framework will help businesses with the transparency and management of naturerelated risks. We continue to provide feedback on the framework through our membership of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). We are also refreshing our approach to managing nature-related risk and developing a pathway to increasing our disclosures in line with TNFD.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our nature-related disclosures, see our 2022 Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.\n\nWe have also strengthened our approach to environmental risk management by developing a shared language and a standardised set of controls, and ensuring we are assessing the full breadth of potential environmental impacts in a consistent way across our business.\n\nAs part of the Health, Safety, Environment and Security Transformation Programme, we have continued to develop and implement the environment modules, with the 'air' and 'water' modules in use at our Saguenay-Lac-SaintJean operations in Quebec, Canada. The programme will improve how we manage our environmental data, allowing us to use this information to support our decision making, meet the growing demand for transparency, and set meaningful targets for continuous improvement in environmental performance.\n\nWe have also worked to ensure that environmental management is consistent and embedded across all processes in our business and through the lifecycle of our operations. To support our assets in managing their environmental performance, we incorporated environmental risk ownership and performance measurement into the safety maturity model (SMM), which focuses on leadership behaviours in the field and critical risk management.\n\nWith our product groups, Health and Commercial teams, we started developing a roadmap for future-proofing our product stewardship to ensure that we continue to deliver products that safeguard the environment, health and safety of our communities and end-consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water\n\nWater is a shared resource critical to sustaining biodiversity, people and economic prosperity. Increasingly disrupted weather patterns and more extreme weather events due to climate change, and a growing world population, mean efficiently managing water is more important than ever.\n\nThe way we think about water and manage associated risks reflects the diversity of our operations and geographic locations. A small proportion of our assets operate in waterscarce regions, while others must remove excess water to allow safe mining operations. These are examples of the many potential risks we manage across the lifecycle of our diverse operations.\n\nWe share water with the communities and nature surrounding our operations, so we aim to avoid permanent impacts on water resources by carefully managing the quality and quantity of the water we use and return to the environment. This means balancing the needs of our operations with those of the local communities and ecosystems. We do this while considering the impact of climate change, already felt in the level of rainfall and water security at some of our operations. We understand this responsibility extends beyond the life of our operations.\n\nTo address this complexity, we adopt a catchment-level approach to developing potential solutions and managing our risks and impacts within our operations. We use baseline water stress as determined by the World Resource Institute to identify operational catchments of most concern.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nvisit our website www.riotinto.com/water\n\n## Exploring\n\n## nature-based solutions\n\nIn 2022, we launched a new team of specialists focused on nature-based solutions, who will explore and invest in high-quality projects that implement internationally accepted social and environmental safeguards and contribute to reducing our carbon footprint. As part of this work, we will partner with host communities and other local stakeholders to learn from them and jointly find ways to improve the resilience and protect the biodiversity of land in and around our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nsee our website.",

        "page_content": "## Group water risk profile (% of managed operations)\n\nTo manage our water impacts, we first need to understand the specific risks at more than 50 operating sites, as well as our overall Group impacts. To do this, we have developed a water risk framework that considers:\n\n- - Water resource\n- - Quality and quantity\n- - Dewatering\n- - Long-term obligations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLow risk\n\nModerate risk\n\nHigh risk\n\nVery high risk\n\nNot applicable\n\nWe use this framework to identify, assess and manage water risks. This comprehensive approach extends beyond our mandatory reporting obligations and allows us to have relevant conversations about water risks internally and with stakeholders in the communities where we operate. In 2022, we continued to embed the last component of the framework - the Group water control library - which describes all controls identified to manage our water risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water resource\n\nIs there enough water available for both environment and community needs, and our operational use?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water quality and quantity\n\nDoes the way we manage water on site, or discharge excess water, cause environmental impacts or operational constraints?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dewatering\n\nDoes the removal of water from the operational areas of our sites impact regional aquifers or our mine plans?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Long-term obligations\n\nDo our operational activities generate long-term or ongoing obligations related to water?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n## Our water balance\n\nOur Group water balance outlines where water was withdrawn from, discharged to, recycled or reused, and consumed at our operations.\n\nThe reported categories correlate with the requirements of the ICMM, Minerals Council of Australia and Global Reporting Initiatives.\n\nWe also report on our aggregated water balance for sites in waterstressed areas. We assess baseline water stress using the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas mapping tool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nsee the 2022 Sustainability Fact Book at riotinto.com/sustainabilityreporting.\n\nThe water resource risk at Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia is assessed as moderate, even though it is located in the Gobi Desert. Oyu Tolgoi sources its water requirements from a deep water supply, the Gunii Hooloi aquifer, a 150-metre deep resource holding around 6.8 billion cubic metres of non-drinkable saline water. Oyu Tolgoi uses this water source efficiently with water recycling and conservation practices implemented across the operation.\n\nOur QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM) operation in Madagascar operates in a highly sensitive area from a water, broader environment and community perspective. The discharges from our operation have the potential to impact receiving water quality and, therefore, the water quality risk is assessed as high. We are working to improve management activities on site, including our ability to more accurately measure our water discharge quality, and the deployment of a dedicated water treatment plant to adjust the discharge pH.\n\nImpacts associated with dewatering and water supply activities in the Pilbara are recognised as a very high risk for our business. Returning water to the aquifers impacted by our mining activities in a controlled manner is the focus of a number of studies. We are working with Traditional Owners on water management.\n\nWe may sometimes generate impacts that we are required to manage over the long term, such as post-closure pit lakes in the Pilbara, or potential seepage from our waste rock or tailings facilities in our aluminium and copper sites. Our systems and standards aim to ensure that risks are identified early and managed appropriately and responsibly throughout the asset lifecycle.\n\n## Our water withdrawals\n\nOur total operational withdrawals for 2022 were 1,119 GL, a 4% increase compared with 2021. Freshwater, or category 1 quality, withdrawals accounted for 432 GL or 39% of this total, which remains consistent with our 2021 withdrawals. Freshwater is generally suitable for consumption with minimal treatment required. Where possible, we aim to minimise our extractions from water sources of this quality.\n\nTotal discharges for 2022 were 638 GL, a 3% reduction compared with 2021. Total water recycled or reused for 2022 was 328 GL, a 6% increase over our 2021 performance.\n\nOur Group water risk profile shows the level of exposure against each of the four risk categories. Most of our water risks sit in the 'low' to 'moderate' range. There are some in 'very high' and 'high' categories for each. Regardless of the level of risk, we apply rigorous standards and processes to manage them.",

We recognise our responsibility to effectively mitigate the impact of our operations on nature, and we are mindful of our own dependence on healthy ecosystems to run a successful business.\n\nHealthy natural environments with functioning ecosystems are key to climate resilience. They also provide important services to the communities where we operate and our business. We are committed to protecting biodiversity and our ambition is to achieve no net loss. This means striking a balance between negative impacts on biodiversity and positive outcomes achieved through mitigation.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nWe continue to assess the sensitivity of our planned activities using combined global datasets of threatened species and conservation and protected areas, developed by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP WCMC). This helps inform our risk-prioritisation of assets in areas of high biodiversity, including exploration and project sites, and supports our allocation of resources. In 2022, we enhanced the resolution of our assessments with\n\n## Land\n\nWe are temporary custodians of the land on which we operate, and we aim to rehabilitate the land as soon as it becomes available.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nIn 2022, we rehabilitated 16 square kilometres of land, mostly at our bauxite mines in Australia, mineral sands mines in South Africa and Madagascar, and at our iron ore mines and exploration areas in the Pilbara, Western Australia. In the southern Gobi Desert in Mongolia, following successful rehabilitation of the Oyu Tolgoi to Khanbogd Soum old dirt road, we relinquished around 50 hectares of land, returning the land back to its original use of grazing by the local herders.\n\n## Waste\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nWaste and residues from our operational activities are key areas of environmental risk management. In 2022, we continued to focus on managing potential contamination from these sources. This included working to remove all use of PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in fire-suppression systems at our sites by the end of 2022. Although we removed the use of PFAS in the majority of these systems, in some instances this transition will not be completed until 2024\n\nimproved geo-spatial data for our assets, ensuring the protection of sensitive areas in proximity to our activities.\n\nAs a founding partner of UNEP WCMC's 19-year-old Proteus Partnership, and aligned with our drive to build our internal capability, we continued to deliver biodiversity training to employees across the business. In 2022, we prioritised QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), Simandou and our Commercial team in China to receive biodiversity training, which we delivered in their respective languages.\n\nWe continue to innovate to help us become better environmental stewards. At QMM and Simandou, we have begun assessing the feasibility of using new environmental DNA technology to help us understand the full scope of species in and around our operations, allowing for more tailored and effective mitigation measures. In 2023, we are looking to expand this approach according to our sites' risk prioritisation. At our Weipa operations in Australia, we trialled machine learning to help us with monitoring by replicating human identification of the endangered Palm Cockatoo, freeing up resources for increased conservation work.\n\nThrough the development of our environmental risk control libraries, we are also strengthening how we plan for and implement progressive rehabilitation.\n\nIn 2022, our land footprint - total disturbed area - was 3,810 square kilometres, an increase of 75 square kilometres compared to 2021. This includes all disturbances to our operating assets and activities, such as exploration activities, smelters, mines and supporting infrastructure.\n\nOur rehabilitation teams partner with research centres and universities to refine rehabilitation approaches and improve outcomes. In 2022, as a forum member of the Australian-led Cooperative Research Centre for\n\nat the earliest. This is due to delays in starting the retrofit or overhaul of major pieces of infrastructure, as well as challenges in sourcing alternative fluorine free substances for use in fire-suppression systems in some jurisdictions.\n\nAt some of our long-life assets, we continually evaluate past waste management practices that have led to a need for remediation in the present. For example, in 2022, we remained focused on finding additional ways to transform waste and by-products from our aluminium operations into materials for use in the construction and agricultural sectors.\n\nWe also invested C$2.67 million to support the Saguenay Fjord Ecosystem Research Group in Quebec, Canada, which brings together researchers and professionals from INREST 1 , Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi, and Universit\u00e9 Laval. The group will document and understand the factors that influence the Saguenay Fjord ecosystem, which is both a unique natural ecosystem and a crucial waterway for the economy of the SaguenayLac-Saint-Jean region and the province of Quebec. This knowledge will help keep our shipping operations running in a way that is safe for the Saguenay ecosystem.\n\nIn 2022, we completed an independent review of the monitoring programmes of our highpriority biodiversity sites, which included ensuring that management plans and actions adequately address risks to nature.\n\nAt the Simandou project in Guinea, and drawing on data collected over the last decade, in 2022 we continued updating our baseline assessments. In the second quarter of 2023, we will publish the revised Environmental and Social Impact Assessment.\n\nTransformations in Mining Economies (CRC TiME), we contributed to the coordinated investment into innovative research that addresses the complex challenges underpinning mine closure and relinquishment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our closure work, see page 71.\n\nWe also completed several trials using satellitederived data to determine if we could measure rehabilitation performance at a global scale, while at the same time complementing the monitoring data collected locally. In addition, 16 of our operations completed rehabilitation trials to improve seed germination, erosion and topsoil quality.\n\nWe have assets with chemically reactive mineral waste risks, which we manage by conducting independent reviews to assess the effectiveness of our risk management programmes and identify areas for improvement. In 2022, we conducted reviews at Yarwun in Australia, Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, and at Kennecott, Boron, Resolution Copper and the Ridgeway closed site in the US.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout tailings, see page 71.",

        "page_content": "## Air quality\n\nClean air is critical for the health of our host communities and the surrounding ecosystems. We are working to improve air quality management, focusing on emissions of particulate matter and gases from our operational activities, including mining, materials handling, processing and transportation. The potentially hazardous emissions we monitor at operations are:\n\n- - sulphur oxides (SOx), mainly at our aluminium and copper smelters\n- - nitrogen oxides (NOx), mainly from burning fossil fuels\n- - gaseous fluoride emissions from aluminium smelters\n- - respirable particulate emissions (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ), very fine particles from mining and processing operations and from burning fossil fuels.\n\nOur emphasis is on reducing emissions at source by upgrading equipment to use the best available technologies, adding air pollution control equipment, and using renewable energy or alternative feed material where possible. Our air quality management programmes include monitoring, sampling at source, incident tracking and risk assessments.\n\nMany of our assets have multi-year air quality improvement projects in place. For example, at our Boron operations in California, US we updated a boiler to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides emitted. At our Pilbara Iron Ore operations, in a region prone to high dust emissions, we created a working group to improve our dust management. The group developed and implemented new controls and improved the dust management systems.\n\nFor example, at the West Angelas mine, we installed a new dust collector which reduced respirable dust (PM 10 ) emissions by 59%.\n\nIn some instances, we did not comply with permissible emission limits. For example, in April, at our Arvida plant in Saguenay-LacSaint-Jean, Quebec, Canada our continuous monitoring system indicated that we exceeded the monthly emission limit for dust and fluoride in pot rooms. This had no adverse impact on air quality, and we remained compliant with our daily and annual limits. We investigated, made adjustments to comply with the emission limit and resumed compliance the following month.\n\nWith the evolution of climate and our operating conditions, we are focusing on prevention to make sure that we understand evolving conditions and how we can adapt our operations.\n\n## Operational environment overview\n\n|                                                                 | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Significant environmental incidents 1                           | 0      | 3      | 0      | 0      | 0      |\n| Fines and prosecutions - environment ($'000) 2                  | 109.8  | 7.4    | 27.4   | 19.0   | 284.7  |\n| Land footprint - disturbed (cumulative square kilometres) 3     | 3,810  | 3,735  | 3,630  | 3,627  | 3,595  |\n| Land footprint - rehabilitated (cumulative square kilometres) 3 | 522    | 494    | 490    | 489    | 485    |\n| Mineral waste disposed or stored (million tonnes)               | 973    | 1,005  | 987    | 905    | 886    |\n| Non-mineral waste disposed or stored (million tonnes)           | 0.76   | 0.65   | 0.47   | 0.28   | 0.27   |\n| SOx emissions (thousand tonnes)                                 | 66.2   | 70.2   | 75.7   | 79.0   | 84.2   |\n| NOx emissions (thousand tonnes) 4                               | 64.4   | 62.3   | 65.2   | 64.3   | 62.0   |\n| Fluoride emissions (thousand tonnes)                            | 2.35   | 2.36   | 2.27   | 2.34   | 2.61   |\n| Particulate (PM10) emissions (thousand tonnes) 5                | 181.7  | 142.3  | 143.2  | 131.5  | 136.2  |\n\n- 3.

        "page_content": "## Mining and metals practices\n\n## Tailings\n\nWe engage with stakeholders throughout the lifecycle of our tailings storage facilities, from design to closure. We also collaborate closely with external bodies to improve the way tailings are managed across our industry.\n\nWe manage 95 tailings storage facilities (TSFs) across our global assets. There are a further 43 non-managed TSFs. Altogether, there are 57 active TSFs, 39 are inactive and 42 are closed. There have been no external wall failures at any of our TSFs for more than 20 years.\n\nWe work through technical committees and joint venture relationships to support leading practice in tailings management. Our full tailings disclosure is available on our website riotinto. com/tailings and we periodically update the list of TSFs to reflect operational and ownership changes, including changes due to the transition to closure or remediation obligations for legacy assets and reclassification of facilities. Our list also includes links to TSFs managed by our joint venture partners.\n\nOur facilities are regulated and permitted and have been managed for many years to comply with local laws, regulations, permits, licences and other requirements. Tailings management has been included in the Group risk register since 2010, and our Group safety standard for tailings and water storage facilities has been in place since 2015. Our internal assurance processes verify that our managed TSFs operate in accordance with this standard, which we updated in 2020.\n\nOur operational TSFs have emergency response plans - tested through training exercises in collaboration with stakeholders such as local emergency services - and follow strict business resilience and communications protocols.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\nIn December 2022, we updated previously disclosed information on our global TSFs. All facilities were assigned a consequence classification in accordance with the regulatory or industry body that oversees tailings in each region or jurisdiction. Additional technical data from updated downstream impact assessments, required under the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and our own internal standard for tailings and water storage facilities, resulted in a modification to hazard classifications of some facilities. Consequence classifications are not ratings of the condition of a facility or the likelihood of failure; instead, they rate the potential consequence if the facility were to fail.\n\nSince the launch of GISTM in August 2020, we have continued work on our implementation plan. We have completed a gap analysis against our internal tailings management, environment, and communities and social performance standards, and developed improvement plans to close identified gaps. We are working towards having all TSFs with a potential consequence rated 'extreme' or 'very high' in conformance with GISTM by August 2023, with all remaining facilities in conformance by August 2025.\n\n## 90+\n\nlegacy assets managed within our portfolio\n\n## 38\n\nof our assets have asset closure strategies in place\n\nWe played an active role in the ICMM tailings working group in 2022, which published key guidance materials to support the safe, responsible management of tailings with the goal of eliminating fatalities and catastrophic events.\n\nThese include:\n\n- - The Tailings Reduction Roadmap, which provides strategic direction on how to accelerate the development and adoption of technologies to reduce tailings production.\n- - The Tailings Management Good Practice Guide, which provides guidance on good governance and engineering practices to support continuous improvement in tailings management.\n- - The Good Practice Guide training materials, designed to build awareness and capability in good governance and tailings engineering practices.\n\nIn 2022, we also:\n\n- - Conducted multi-disciplinary risk assessments for all our 'very high' and 'extreme' consequence facilities.\n- - Continued to support the Future Tails partnership, a collaboration between Rio Tinto, BHP and the University of Western Australia (UWA). In 2022, the Graduate Certificate in Tailings Management at UWA had 106 enrolled students from 12 countries in micro-credentialled units. Two PhD candidates also commenced their research programmes in 2022.\n- - Partnered with BHP on tailings filtration solutions at very high throughputs for copper operations, which supports our goal of increasing water recovery and recycling.\n- - Continued to regularly convene the Tailings Management Committee with our designated Accountable Executives, which provides coordinated governance of tailings management practices across the Group.\n\n## Closure\n\nThrough safe and responsible asset closure, we are working to deliver shared benefits for host communities, employees and investors; positive ESG outcomes; and innovative solutions that minimise long-term liabilities. We do this in partnership with our stakeholders, embedding closure considerations throughout the lifespan of our assets - in the way we design, build, run, close and transition them.\n\nAs temporary stewards of the land where we operate, we partner with our stakeholders to develop a shared vision for the future of the lands and host communities. Balancing environmental, financial and social considerations, we look for opportunities associated with progressive closure, remediation and repurposing, and, where appropriate, long-term monitoring and maintenance.\n\nAt the end of 2022, closure provisions on our balance sheet totalled $15.8 billion (2021: $14.5 billion).\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n## Argyle diamond mine\n\nWe continue to close the Argyle diamond mine in Western Australia. In 2022, we completed the high-reach demolition of structures and processing equipment on site and progressed reprofiling and rehabilitation works. We are engaging with Miriwoong and Gija Traditional Owners on how to best support and expand meaningful participation as we progress closure activities.\n\n## Gove refinery and residue disposal areas\n\nWhile mining continues at our Gove bauxite operations in the Northern Territory in Australia, we are implementing progressive closure activities, including the decommissioning and demolition of the refinery and progressive capping of the bauxite residue disposal areas. In 2022, we completed the relocation of essential services, including electrical and water, from the refinery footprint to begin safe demolition. This work supports the security of services for the town of Nhulunbuy post closure.\n\n## Ranger uranium mine\n\nEnergy Resources of Australia (ERA) is rehabilitating the Ranger uranium mine in the Northern Territory, Australia. We are committed to the successful rehabilitation of Ranger to a standard that will establish an environment similar to the adjacent Kakadu National Park, a World Heritage site. We acknowledge the Traditional Owners, the Mirarr people's, consistent opposition to developing the Jabiluka uranium deposit and restate our full support for ERA's commitment that the deposit would never be developed without the Mirarr people's consent. Our utmost priority and commitment is to the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area in a way that is consistent with the wishes of the Mirarr people.",

        "page_content": "Following ERA's announcement of cost and schedule overruns in February 2022, we sought to work constructively with ERA's Independent Board Committee (IBC) to find a funding solution to meet its rehabilitation obligations. This included engaging for several months on an interim entitlement offer that was deferred by the IBC in July 2022 when its proposed terms failed to obtain major shareholder support.\n\nIn October 2022, ERA's IBC resigned as directors of ERA to allow for the introduction of new perspectives to address the rehabilitation costs.\n\nWhile a funding solution for the rehabilitation is being identified and agreed by new ERA Independent Directors, we agreed to amend an existing A$100 million credit facility to assist ERA with its management of immediate liquidity issues.\n\nTogether with ERA and other key stakeholders including the Mirarr people, we supported the recent amendments to the Atomic Energy Act 1953 (Cth), which will allow rehabilitation activities at Ranger to extend beyond the previously legislated timeframe of January 2026.\n\n## Legacy assets\n\nWe manage over 90 legacy assets in nine countries. Where appropriate, we rehabilitate these sites and work with local stakeholders to transition them to their next use. For example, at Mount Rosser in Jamaica, an inactive bauxite reside storage facility, we have covered 95% of the site with vegetation, seeing a diverse and sustainable mix of plant species all using a top-soil-free rehabilitation method. We progressed rehabilitation at Pohatcong, a packaging site in New Jersey, US by completing in-situ thermal remediation to treat and eliminate contaminates in soil. In France, we completed our post-mining obligations at Le Thoronet, a former bauxite mine, and handed back the site to the French authorities for monitoring and maintenance.\n\nWe continue to work in partnership with the French Ministry of Ecological Transition to further restore the site and create a diverse space with public hiking trails set to open in 2023.\n\nWe continued work on our GISTM compliance plan, and in 2022, we strengthened our knowledge of legacy sites.\n\n## Strengthening our approach\n\nWe completed six asset closure strategies in 2022, now in place for 38 of our operations. These strategies create a progressive vision for future land use after our operations cease and focus on opportunities to reduce closure costs and risks over the asset lifecycle. All of our operating sites have closure plans. We review these plans regularly to align with stakeholder expectations and to incorporate lessons learned from other closure projects. At operations with joint ownership structures, we work in partnership with other asset owners to ensure closure is considered throughout asset design, planning and operations.\n\n## Working in partnership\n\nSuccessful closure needs to align with the expectations of host communities and governments. We are developing new approaches to engagement, such as co-creation of the future use and landform, co-execution and co-governance. To achieve this, we are working with host communities, including Indigenous partners, on rehabilitation, revegetation and long-term monitoring at many sites.\n\nWe look for opportunities across our portfolio to contribute to decarbonisation efforts for the communities where we operate. For example, at our Gove bauxite operations, we are working to introduce solar power into the grid to support sustainable power for the region beyond mining.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe partner with universities, governments and other organisations to find opportunities to repurpose and reprocess mineral and industrial waste, improve treatment and valorisation of mining-influenced waters, and explore the social aspects of mine closure.\n\nFor example:\n\n- - We joined the Mining Microbiome Analytics Platform project to identify microbes that could help the industry mine and remediate sites more sustainably. For more information, see our website.\n- - Through our joint venture partnership with Regeneration Enterprises, we developed partnership strategies on re-mining and remediation of two legacy assets. We have engaged key technology, research and development, and ecological partners in our closure work.\n- - We joined the National Alliance for Water Innovation, a public-private partnership that brings together a team of industry and academic partners. The team examines the critical technical barriers and research needed to radically lower the cost and energy of desalination to secure an affordable, energy-efficient and resilient water supply for the US economy.\n- - We continued engagement in partnership with the Gove Peninsula Futures Reference Group (GPRFG) to plan for a sustainable future for Nhulunbuy and the Gove Peninsula post-mining for the benefit of Yolngu land owners, local communities and businesses. Members include the Gumatj and Rirratjingu Traditional Owners, the Northern Land Council, the Northern Territory Government, Australian Government and Rio Tinto. Learn how the GPRFG is supporting a positive transition on their website govefutures.nt.gov.au\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout closure provisions and financial statements, see page 182.\n\n## The slow journey from red mud to green plants\n\nA once-barren area that for decades was the collection point for red mud, which is waste related to bauxite processing, Mount Rosser in Jamaica is now an area of increasing plant and animal diversity. It is replete with lessons about ecology, chemistry, botany, relationships with local communities, and the importance of steadfast perseverance. Above all, this decades-long remediation project demonstrates that progress is possible even when there is no easy solution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more\n\non our website.",

Sometimes this requires courage, which is one of our three values.\n\n## 2022 progress\n\n## Business integrity\n\nDuring 2022, we delivered several compliance programme improvements to ensure we continued to be in line with our current business integrity risks. We are exposed to reputational, financial and non-financial risk through the actions of third parties we engage with. We are updating our Third-Party Risk Management programme so we can optimise risk assessments, processes, systems and tools, and improve integration with other associated business processes. We are also managing our risk exposure to economic sanctions, monitoring new sanctions and continuing our ongoing assessment of our supply chains.\n\nIn 2022, we focused on how we monitor key fraud controls. We conducted a fraud risk assessment and reviewed the current measures we have in place to prevent and detect fraud risk. This will help us better understand the root causes of fraud and how we can improve our response.\n\nWe also updated our data privacy standard, which sets out the minimum requirements for how to collect and process personal data. Our monitoring now covers requirements of the data privacy programme.\n\n## Annual training\n\nWe know that our reputation as a business that acts ethically and with integrity depends on the actions and decisions we make every day. We empower our people to seek guidance when faced with an ethical or business integrity dilemma - both to prevent incidents from occurring, and to protect them and others from harm. To help our workforce navigate grey areas and spot business integrity red flags, we have developed an online training course that challenges them to make ethical decisions through a number of interactive scenarios. Our online business integrity induction training provides all new joiners with an introduction to ethics and compliance as well as the tools they need to recognise and understand business integrity risks. In addition to online training, the Ethics and Compliance team provides ongoing targeted face-to-face sessions on key risk areas including bribery and corruption, data privacy and competition.\n\n## 24,857 employees\n\nundertook compliance training in 2022\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nIn early 2023, we launched our updated Code of Conduct - The Way We Work , which is available on our website at www.riotinto.com. Our Code of Conduct will work as a central tool in reshaping our culture and it demonstrates what living our values of care, courage and curiosity should look like. The code sets out our commitment to conducting business with integrity and provides clarity about the behaviours we expect and why responsible business conduct matters. The new code is broader in scope than our previous code and reflects changes in both internal and societal expectations regarding business conduct. It will help our people reflect on the potential impacts our decisions may have on the business and others. Updates to our Code of Conduct will be made available on our website pursuant to relevant laws and regulations.\n\n## myVoice, our confidential reporting programme\n\nWe have continued to develop our confidential reporting programme myVoice, which is designed to help our people voice concerns about potential misconduct or improper behaviour. Our care for our people and our desire to understand contributing factors for misconduct sit at the core of this programme.\n\nThe Business Conduct Office (BCO) is working to increase transparency and improve how we capture learnings from the myVoice programme by expanding the team to include a reporting and governance function. We continue to see an increase in reporting and we believe this means that more people are feeling comfortable to share their concerns. In 2022, we received 1,459 reports through the myVoice programme channels. Of these cases, 63% were substantiated, including 77 cases which were reports received in 2021.\n\nThe BCO is currently implementing two key recommendations from the Everyday Respect Report that was released in February 2022. We are setting up a discrete unit of experts who will support and care for our people who have been impacted by harmful and disrespectful behaviours. The team will also be available to support leaders and human resources professionals in how to respond, and other people who have been affected by those behaviours. Separately we are also redesigning our investigation process to make sure it is trauma-informed, caring and people-centred.\n\nThe BCO reports to our Chief Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate Affairs; the Board; and the Global Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout the Everyday Respect initiative, visit riotinto.com/everydayrespect.\n\n## myVoice* case activity\n\n|                                       | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of reports                     | 1,459  | 1,246  | 748    | 805    | 679    |\n| Number of reports per 1,000 employees | 28.1   | 26     | 16.3   | 17.9   | 14.3   |\n| Substantiated claims (%)              | 63%    | 51%    | 42%    | 34%    | 34%    |\n\n- * myVoice (introduced in 2021), replaced the programme formerly known as Talk to Peggy or Speak-OUT.",

        "page_content": "## Emerging risks\n\nEmerging risks are highly uncertain by nature. As a company, we are exposed to many complex and sometimes interrelated risks, due to the number of commodities we produce and our global footprint. We track leading indicators of emerging risks and their likely impact on us and the communities where we operate. We proactively analyse the impact of these risks through plausible scenarios of the interplay of the global megatrends, as outlined in the Strategy section on page 12.\n\nWe are impacted by growing geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty that could potentially impact global growth and affect market volatility and sentiment.\n\nCyber-security attacks have become more destructive. An emerging area of exposure for the business is the rapid digitalisation and transformation of operational technology environments.\n\nClimate change and the low-carbon transition continues to provide both upside and downside uncertainties for us. We address these uncertainties under our principal risks 2, 3, 4 and 12 detailed in the following pages. We closely monitor and assess the impact of climate change through scenarios; see pages 152-153. Our 2022 Climate Change Report outlines our current and future initiatives and partnerships, and how we aim to work together to meet our Scope 1 and 2 targets and Scope 3 goals.\n\n## Longer-term viability statement\n\nDelivering our strategy depends on our four objectives: to be the best operator; to achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials; to excel in development; and to strengthen our social licence. Our business model supporting our strategy is underpinned by the quality of our assets, the capabilities of our people, our operational and sustainability performance, innovative partnerships, and disciplined capital allocation. For more information about our strategy and business model, see pages 13-17.\n\nOur business planning processes include modelling a series of macroeconomic scenarios and using various assumptions that consider internal and external factors. As part of our robust risk management framework, we closely track, monitor and mitigate principal risks to our business plan.\n\n## Viability assessment process and key assumptions\n\nThe assumptions underlying our business plan and macroeconomic forecast have the greatest level of certainty for the first three years. Our longer-term viability assessment examines the first five years (2023-27) of the business plan. This allows for a detailed analysis of the potential impacts of risks materialising in quick succession in the first three years, and enables us to further stress test the business plan for risk materialising towards the end of the time period, although with less certainty. This allows our Directors to assess the Group's capacity to exercise financial levers available in both the three-year and five-year time frames to maintain our viability.\n\nThe Principal risks and uncertainties section outlines risks that could materially affect our performance, future prospects or reputation. For the viability assessment, we have considered our principal risks that could severely impact the Group's liquidity and solvency.\n\n## Assessment of viability\n\nOur longer-term viability assessment considers the following principal risks and key assumptions.\n\n## Principal risk A - 'Remaining competitive through economic cycles or shocks'\n\nScenario assumptions: Continued elevation of supply-side pressure and sharp interest rate rises triggers stagflation and liquidity crises in developing economies. A housing crisis leads to positive but low growth in China. Commodity prices experience large negative pricing shocks in 2023, sustained through to 2027.\n\nPrincipal risk B - 'Preventing fatalities, permanent disablements, and illness from a major hazard or safety event' or 'Preventing material business disruption and/or data breaches due to cyber events'\n\nScenario assumptions: Occurrence of a singular catastrophic event resulting from a major cyber-security breach or operational failure, such as a tailings and water storage facility failure, extreme weather event or underground or geotechnical event resulting in multiple fatalities, cessation of operations and significant financial impacts. We have assumed two such events occur within the assessment period, in 2023 and 2026.\n\n## Principal risk C - 'Delivering on our growth projects'\n\nScenario assumptions: Materialisation of a risk impacting our ESG credentials (such as 'building trusted relationships with Indigenous peoples' and 'building trusted relationships with communities') and our ability to deliver our growth strategy. We have assumed an impact on our near-term key projects and considered available alternatives. The assumed financial impact is in addition to any non-financial impact, such as reputational damage to the Group or disruption to the culture and way of life of the communities where we operate.\n\nWe quantify the expected financial impact of each risk based on internal macroeconomic and business analysis, as well as internal and external benchmarking on similar risks.\n\nThe first five years of our business plan have been stress tested for each risk to assess the impact on the Group's longer-term viability, including whether additional financing facilities would be required. In addition to liquidity and solvency, the assessment also considered other financial performance metrics, as well as dividend payments. These metrics are subject to robust stress tests and reverse stress tests.\n\nThe most severe scenario, albeit unlikely, considers the financial impact of all three risks materialising at the start of the assessment period, followed by a second major hazard or cyber event occurring towards the end of the five-year period. Without management action, this scenario would create both an immediate and prolonged severe impact, resulting in the Group's free cash flow performance over the assessment period being materially impacted.\n\nWe have a suite of management actions available to preserve resilience through the assessment period, including accessing lines of credit, reducing organic and inorganic growth capital expenditure, and raising capital. Our financial flexibility could potentially be limited during the peak of the crisis. The viability of the Group remained sound under all tested scenarios.\n\nWe have also conducted reverse stress testing by assessing the impact of reducing price levels, and we have concluded that the Group remains viable in the very low probability of prolonged price declines across all commodities.\n\nFour factors underpin the resilience of our business model:\n\n- - The competitive position and diversification of our commodities portfolio.\n- - The disciplined capital allocation framework and commitment to prudent financial policy.\n- - The payout shareholder return policy, which is based on earnings and is, therefore, more sustainable.\n- - The focus on achieving impeccable ESG performance and strengthening our social licence, which allows for growth and maintaining access to debt capital and bank loan markets.\n\nConsidering our current position and the robust assessment of our principal risks, the Directors have assessed the Group's prospects over the next five years (until 31 December 2027) and reasonably expect that we will continue to operate and meet our liabilities as they fall due over that period. However, in the long term, two principal risks with long-dated consequences could potentially have a material impact on our viability:\n\n- - Growing our iron ore business to meet the demand for green steel.\n- - Leaving a positive legacy for future generations, by embedding closure considerations throughout the lifespan of our assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nsee pages 81 and 86.",

By definition, they involve subjective judgments and depend on changes in our internal and external environments. While we deploy preventative and mitigative controls to reduce the likelihood of risks occurring, and manage potential impacts, some inherent risks to our business remain. These include natural disasters, where there is limited capacity in the international insurance markets to transfer such risks. We closely monitor these threats and develop business resilience plans. We also seek to bring an equal level of rigour and discipline to our managed and non-managed joint ventures as we do to our wholly-owned\n\nassets, through engagement and influence, in line with applicable laws. The timeframe of our principal risks is within five years unless explicitly stated otherwise. The principal risks, uncertainties and trends outlined in this report should be considered forward-looking statements and are subject to the cautionary statement on page 347.\n\nThis year, we have reframed our principal risks in the context of our overarching strategic objectives: to be the best operator; to achieve impeccable environmental, social and governance (ESG) credentials; to excel in development; and to strengthen our social licence.

We are working on building a workplace where all our people are trusted and empowered to be their best selves and help drive change.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nBest operator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nOur values inspire our people to contribute in ways that align with our purpose and strategic direction, enabling us to build a workplace where everyone feels safe, respected and included.\n\n## Threats\n\nAs societal expectations are changing, and higher standards are placed on organisations, we must ensure that we are consistently displaying and living our values. Without change or action, our ability to attract and retain partners and talented people will be negatively impacted. The trust from host communities and countries may also be weakened, limiting our operating licence and growth opportunities.\n\nIn February 2022, we released the findings and recommendations from an independent review of our workplace culture ( Everyday Respect Report ). The findings in this report also aligned with the recommended actions coming from the Parliament of Western Australia's Inquiry into Sexual Harassment in the Mining Industry, released in June 2022. Both reports highlighted the scale of change required in our business and across the resources sector.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Group Executive Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe embarked on a culture change programme led by the refresh of our values in 2021. We have accelerated this work in 2022 through the Everyday Respect task force. In 2022, we also updated our Code of Conduct - The Way We Work (launched in early 2023), to be clearer and more comprehensive. It acts as the blueprint for our key principles, sets out our commitments to stakeholders and clarifies how we expect our people to behave.\n\nTo help our leaders and teams live our values, we have:\n\n- - Launched our updated purpose and values, supported by internal communications and leadership training.\n- - Launched several Everyday Respect task force workstreams to address sexual harassment, bullying and racism in our workplace; built safe and appropriate facilities; and encouraged caring, humancentred responses to disrespectful and harmful behaviours.\n- - Improved our internal whistleblowing programme, myVoice, which is open to employees and external stakeholders to report on behaviour inconsistent with our values and Code of Conduct.\n- - Introduced behavioural training for leaders to encourage care and respect.\n\n## 2. Achieving our decarbonisation targets competitively\n\nClimate change continues to be at the heart of our strategy, and our ability to deliver on our objectives hinges on achieving our Scope 1 and 2 targets between now and 2050. Finding a balance between our ESG commitments and our need to invest for growth will support us in leaving a positive legacy and delivering superior shareholder returns while remaining competitive.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nImpeccable ESG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nDecarbonising our assets can enhance our competitive advantage and embed a culture of energy efficiency that could benefit our host communities. Renewable energy projects will likely provide energy in excess of our needs at certain times, improving the availability of renewable energy in the communities where we operate.\n\nWe are also in a strong position to be the leading supplier of green materials to support the energy transition in North America due to a range of beneficial factors, such as our government partnerships, deep technological capability, advanced critical minerals research, competitive energy access and port infrastructure.\n\n## Threats\n\nDelays in priority initiatives will threaten our Scope 1 and 2 target delivery and our ability to respond proactively and competitively. Our ability to successfully engage and partner with governments and other external parties to achieve grid decarbonisation is a fundamental uncertainty, particularly for our 2025 targets as we continue to develop our pipeline of decarbonisation projects. The rate of progress towards our targets could expose us to reputation and litigation risks.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nOur 2026 to 2030 target delivery relies on abatement from technologies still in the research and development phase.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Risk Management Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Committed $7.5 billion in capital expenditure to the delivery of our targets through six large abatement programmes (including 95% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions) focused on renewables (including 1GW in the Pilbara, 130MW at Richards Bay Minerals and 4GW at our Pacific Aluminium Operations), ELYSIS, process heat (Yarwun, Queensland Alumina Limited) and diesel, supplemented by nature-based solutions and offsets.\n- - Prioritised carbon abatement projects based on five key elements: value, materiality of abatement, maturity of emission reduction, competitiveness versus internal and external benchmarks, and alignment with the net zero 2050 target.\n- - Established a dedicated team (Rio Tinto Energy Development) to support the delivery of large-scale renewable solutions (primarily wind and solar) that are required across our major energy regions.\n- - Set up a dedicated Energy and Climate Change Centre of Excellence, currently focusing on assessing our exposure to physical climate change risks and capability uplift throughout the organisation.\n- - Developed several innovations including establishing the Office of the Chief Scientist; dedicating more than 500 employees to research and development across Canada, France, Australia and the UK; and establishing an Innovation and Technology Centre in China to partner with universities, governments, research laboratories and startups.\n- - Continued to address our Scope 3 emissions by supporting our customers in their decarbonisation journey (see our 2022 Climate Change Report for details), providing low-carbon products (such as aluminium from ELYSIS) and reducing our CO 2 emissions intensity in shipping by 40% by 2025 (currently over 30% to date).\n- - Joined partnerships to develop a zero-carbon fleet; for example, we are piloting battery-powered trucks with Komatsu in 2025 and Caterpillar in 2026.",

Additionally, as studies and projects progress, they are susceptible to changes in technical requirements, approvals, societal expectations, or underlying commercial or economic assumptions that could impact economic viability.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nThe Oyu Tolgoi underground expansion, and increasing approval time frames in the Pilbara and in projects including Simandou, Resolution Copper, Jadar, Rincon and Winu.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Investment Committee, the Ore Reserves Steering Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Focused on excelling in development to deliver inorganic and organic growth by increasing alignment across the Group. We have leveraged our in-house capabilities better (including our Exploration teams, technical Centres of Excellence, Business Development team, the Battery Materials team, and Specialised Projects and Studies division).\n- - Focused on our ambition to invest up to $3 billion per year of growth capital expenditure, which includes energy transition commodities, such as copper, battery materials, high-grade iron ore and critical minerals (rhenium, tellurium, scandium, selenium).\n- - Broadened our scope to include higher-risk jurisdictions and targets, and considered minimum viable projects that can grow and create optionality or are a strategic fit.\n- - Introduced a stage-gate approval process that included progress monitoring to ensure capital discipline for projects.\n- - Ensured robust ESG and human rights due diligence during merger and acquisition assessments and in new country entries.\n\n## 4. Growing our iron ore business to meet demand for green steel\n\nSteel decarbonisation will affect the value of iron ore. We have an opportunity to unlock business value by optimising our iron ore product strategy, partnering with technology providers and universities, and innovating with our customers to meet future demand for green steel.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nBest operator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nWe are working with our customers, universities and technology providers to develop and test technologies that will realise value from our Pilbara Ore. Some examples of current active partnerships include Baowu, Nippon Steel Corporation, POSCO, BlueScope, Shougang Group, Australian National University and Nottingham University. More information about our partnerships is available on our website.\n\n## Threats\n\nThe iron and steel process routes required to decarbonise the steel industry may not favour our Pilbara low- and mid-grade ores, impacting the competitiveness of the Iron Ore portfolio. The transition of the steel value chain towards net zero will need new technologies and extensive industry transformation.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Steel Decarbonisation Steering Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Adjusted our Iron Ore portfolio to bring high-grade ore to the market (for example, our Simandou project).\n- - Established the Steel Decarbonisation team to identify and develop technical and commercial options through strong partnerships across the steel value chain with projects focused on:\n- - Improving existing processes, such as blast furnace optimisation.\n- - Pilbara ore characterisation and beneficiation through partnerships with a number of universities.\n- - Partnerships with customers to develop and test new technologies suitable for Pilbara ore (such as BioIron TM ).",

Remaining competitive through economic cycles or shocks\n\nWe aim to remain competitive, preserve resilience and maintain access to debt capital and bank loan markets by having cost-competitive assets, a diversified commodities portfolio, a strong balance sheet, prudent financial policies and strong ESG credentials.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nBest operator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nFavourable market conditions and strong internal capital discipline allow us to leverage our balance sheet strength, enabling us to invest in growth opportunities, pay down debt and enhance returns to shareholders. We may convert a greater proportion of our resources to reserves through operational efficiencies, deployment of new technologies or improved understanding of our orebodies. An emerging opportunity is the potential to leverage our strong ESG credentials as the number of ESG-focused investors grows.\n\n## Threats\n\nA deteriorating economic and political environment could lead to cost inflation, falling commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting profitability), trade actions (increased tariffs, retaliations and sanctions), and governments' exerting more control over their natural resources by changing contractual, regulatory or tax measures. This could impact our key markets, operations or investments.\n\nFailure to secure mining approvals, replenish reserves, capture the benefits of new technologies or a material reduction in commodity price may reduce the volume of existing reserves and the future conversion of resources to reserves in the required timeframe.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Financial Risk Management Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Implemented the Safe Production System (SPS), which is helping us transform how we operate our assets, better manage performance and empower our people. SPS will help us consistently deliver outstanding safety and production results, and improve our asset and equipment reliability and maintenance (for example, at our Boyne Smelter and Kitimat).\n- - Maintained and assured compliance with the Group's Resources and Reserves Standard through our Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence, which also monitors KPIs to track variation from expected asset production plans.\n- - Kept capital discipline in line with a strong investment-grade credit rating, including investment governance processes, and maintained a strong balance sheet and a payout Shareholder Returns Policy that adjusts returns through the cycle. In addition, we are diversifying funding sources in different capital markets and shelf programmes, and we continue to maintain and renew the revolving credit facility.\n\n## 6. Withstanding impacts of geopolitics on our trade or investments\n\nGeopolitics has the potential to increase trade tensions and undermine rule-based trading systems and possible trade actions (increased tariffs, retaliation, sanctions) that impact our key markets, operations or investments. It may limit any benefits of being a multinational company with a global footprint and may expose us further to these risks. Any presence in politically unstable countries exacerbates this risk.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nBest operator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nBy working closely with governments on balanced domestic policy proposals that bring long-term economic and social benefits for the country, we can also support growth and investments for our business. In addition, global geopolitical re-alignments include the creation of new strategic alliances between countries that could create partnership and growth opportunities, such as the security of critical minerals supply.\n\n## Threats\n\nA deteriorating economic and political environment could lead to falling commodity prices (reduced cash flow, limiting profitability), trade actions (increased tariffs, retaliations and sanctions), and governments' exerting more control over their natural resources by changing contractual, regulatory or tax measures. This could impact our key markets, operations or investments.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nA highly uncertain and unstable global macro environment, including Indo-Pacific tensions and the indirect impacts of the war in Ukraine, can impact our business. Rising energy costs across Europe could potentially affect demand in the region, which in turn would impact our aluminium and minerals markets in Europe.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Financial Risk Management Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Continued to diversify our portfolio of commodities (focusing on green alternatives and minerals), markets and jurisdictions to reduce exposure to specific geopolitical events. Some recent examples include our acquisition of the Rincon Lithium Project in Argentina and development of the Simandou high-grade iron ore project in Guinea.\n- - Established a fully resourced External Affairs function to closely monitor the political and geopolitical environment to identify possible opportunities for the Group through engagement with governments, civil society organisations, industry associations and international bodies.\n- - Implemented the updated new country entry Group procedure and focused on cross-functional, real-time engagement.\n- - Implemented the new sanctions standard and export control procedure to mitigate against potential breaches of economic sanctions and trade controls. We monitor the political environments where we operate and engage with the government in those areas.\n- - Secured a capability to settle and receive renminbi (RMB), including management of central bank digital currency (CBDC) transactions to mitigate the potential impact of trade tensions on key Chinese customers' access to credit and USD.",

Attracting, developing and retaining people with the requisite skills\n\nOur ability to achieve our business strategy depends on attracting, developing and retaining a wide range of internal and external skilled and experienced people.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nBest operator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nInvesting in critical skills and supporting internal career pathways will result in enhanced productivity, innovation and business resilience. Increasing investment in local employment will also support our social licence to operate. And developing partnerships, including with joint ventures, can also help us access future talent.\n\n## Threats\n\nLacking the right capability may result in our business experiencing delays or underperformance. Tight labour markets and entry into new countries result in heightened competition for critical skills; for example, in climate change, energy, decarbonisation, technical mining and processing skills, and community relations. Changing societal expectations place pressure on our brand as an employer, and require us to become better at communicating who we are and what we stand for.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nSince the pandemic, talent is less inclined to relocate, and our reliance on local or national recruitment is therefore increasing, which significantly reduces the market size for sourcing talent.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Board.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Focused on critical roles and expertise in decarbonisation.\n- - Continued to monitor the global talent market, and developments and trends, including talent mobility.\n- - Focused on talent management and planning across our global assets and looked for critical technical capabilities.\n- - Undertaken our bi-annual People Surveys to track engagement, and updated our engagement strategy and retention modelling.\n- - Developed Group-wide employee value propositions tailored by labour market and talent segment to help us retain and attract talent.\n- - Launched a talent acquisition strategy, targeting multiple labour markets and a diverse range of skills.\n- - Continued to focus on local trainee programmes, our global graduate programme, and strategic partnerships with universities and other future skills development partnerships.\n\n## 8. Building trusted relationships with Indigenous peoples\n\nOur partnerships with Indigenous peoples play a material role in our ability to operate. A breakdown in these relationships could impact our business and our reputation. By building respectful and enduring relationships with Indigenous partners and communities, we remain committed to finding better ways to move forward with the communities that host us.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nSocial licence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nWe have the opportunity to work closely with Indigenous peoples to realise long-term socioeconomic, cultural and environmental benefits. Our capacity to deliver value to host communities and Indigenous peoples of the lands and waters on which we operate supports our current and future growth plans; for example, in the Pilbara, in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, and with our existing partnerships at the Iron Ore Company of Canada and at BC Works.\n\n## Threats\n\nMining activities could strain relationships with Indigenous peoples, particularly where actual or perceived damage of significant cultural values (cumulative or acute) occurs without consultation and consent. This could result in a loss of trust and could impact our social licence to operate. This was evident after the destruction of two ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara region in 2020 and the impact it had on the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nOur Resolution Copper project and the modernisation of agreements in the Pilbara.\n\n## Risk oversight\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Sustainability Committee.\n\n## Management's response\n\nWe have:\n\n- - Demonstrated our commitment to building long-term trusted relationships, such as establishing the Juukan Gorge Legacy Foundation with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura Aboriginal Corporation, and co-designing an approach to protect significant social and cultural heritage values as part of our proposed development of the Western Range iron ore project in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.\n- - Implemented an integrated cultural heritage management system and embedded social considerations in approvals and decision-making processes at all levels of the organisation.\n- - Built cultural responsiveness and competence (including for cultural heritage) across our leadership teams and workforce.\n- - Strengthened consultation, meaningful engagement, and free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) processes.\n- - Set clear guidance on how we should conduct our business, no matter where we work or where we are from, through our updated Code of Conduct - The Way We Work (launched in early 2023), communities and social performance standard, and Human Rights Policy.\n\nDetailed updates on our progress on the commitments we made after the destruction of the rock shelters at Juukan Gorge are outlined on page 55 and in the 2022 Communities and Social Performance Disclosure Report .",

Preventing fatalities, permanent disablements, and illness from a major hazard or safety event\n\nNothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and communities. The mining industry is inherently hazardous, with the potential to cause illness or injury, damage to the environment and disruption to communities. Our objective is first and foremost to have zero fatalities. We believe all incidents and injuries are preventable, so our focus is on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks.\n\nStrategic alignment\n\nBest operator\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Opportunities\n\nDemonstrating that we can meet or exceed our commitments in safety and hazard management supports our ability to attract and retain talent and helps us achieve our objective of impeccable ESG credentials.\n\n## Threats\n\nMajor hazards include process safety, underground mining, slope geotechnical and tailings management. Failure to manage our major hazards could result in a catastrophic event or other long-term damage. Loss of technical capability at complex end-of-life underground mines poses a significant risk.\n\nWhile not considered major hazards, significant risks at our sites are falling objects, fall from height, and vehicles and driving, the top three causes of potentially fatal incidents (PFIs), which could result in multiple fatalities across the Group.\n\n## Key exposures\n\nOur underground operations such as Diavik, Oyu Tolgoi and Kennecott.

Regular updates on Major Hazards are provided to the Sustainability Committee.\n- - Established the Centre of Excellence for key technical capability in hazard and asset management and developed (and assured against) the Group standards and procedures.\n- - Implemented technical and safety standards and procedures for slope geotechnical, tailings management, underground mining and process safety. We revised underground standards in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, and launched an associated control library in the Risk Management Information System (Archer).\n- - Focused on fatality elimination through our critical risk management.\n- - Reported, investigated and shared learnings from Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) incidents, such as PFIs, across the Group. We monitor HSES performance at the Group level monthly and discuss trends and actions at the quarterly Safety and Operations Committee.\n- - Included safety targets in personal performance metrics to incentivise safe behaviours and effective risk management (as outlined in the Remuneration report on page 121).\n\n## 12. Minimise our impact on the environments we work in and build physical resilience to changes in those environments, including climate change and natural disasters\n\nBy producing the materials the world needs, we have an effect on the environment.

This could be achieved while remediating disturbed lands, protecting existing pristine areas and supporting the development of associated socioeconomic opportunities independent of mining (and therefore addressing dependencies).\n\n## Threats\n\nA number of our operations and future development opportunities exist within, or close to, sensitive biodiverse regions. To strengthen our licence to operate, we must demonstrate our capability to protect ecosystems through improved practices and technological solutions. Natural disasters or extreme weather events can also endanger our employees and communities, damage our assets or cause significant operational interruption.

        "page_content": "## Chair's introduction\n\nI am excited at joining a company with great people, world-class assets, emerging technologies and new partnerships, but also a company that is emerging from a challenging period in its near 150-year history.\n\nOur ambition is to deliver superior returns for our shareholders by becoming a leader in the global energy transition and finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs.\n\nTo achieve this, the management team had identified four key strategic objectives: becoming the best operator, having impeccable ESG credentials, excelling in development, and strengthening the Group's social licence. Culture transformation had also been identified as a critical enabler of the Group's future success.\n\nMeanwhile, externally, the global geopolitical and macroeconomic environments continue to become more volatile and complex.\n\nWith this backdrop, the Board carried out a comprehensive evaluation in 2022, focused on two key corporate governance priorities we had identified, ensuring that: (i) we have the right mix of skills and experience on the Board for the newly emerging set of opportunities and risks; and (ii) we organise ourselves as a Board and across our committees to focus our time on the right things, at the right time and in the right way so as best to deliver on the purpose, strategy and objectives that we have set for Rio Tinto, all in the context of greater external uncertainty and volatility.\n\nIn terms of Board composition, we concluded that we needed to refresh the Board, with a particular focus on deepening our mining, operations and projects experience and our renewable energy and sustainability capabilities. We also identified the need to add further accounting and audit expertise while ensuring that, overall, we maintained the right balance of diversity.\n\nAs a first stage in this process, I was delighted in December of 2022 to welcome Kaisa Hietala as a Non-Executive Director. Kaisa will be joining the Board on 1 March 2023 and brings a deep understanding of renewables and sustainability through her experience in the resources industry, as well as commercial capabilities, all of which will be invaluable as we work to ensure Rio Tinto thrives in a decarbonising world. Further details are set out in our Nominations Committee report on page 102.\n\nThe wider governance review included external benchmarking analysis of governance structures in peer and other long-cycle companies, interviews with a range of investors and significant Board interaction and discussion on how to improve our overall effectiveness. This included an evaluation questionnaire that was more forward looking than the usual in-year annual evaluation. Given the timing of the strategic governance review, we decided it would be more beneficial to defer the independent third-party evaluation of the Board so that it could take place once these governance enhancements were fully embedded in 2023. The third-party Board evaluation will therefore now take place this year with 2022's forward-looking evaluation as the new baseline.\n\nAfter several dedicated Board sessions on the revised governance proposals, we agreed to implement a number of enhancements from July 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have refreshed the Board's forward programme to ensure we are primarily focused on the four strategic objectives and on the Group's culture transformation. For example, we have expanded the scope of our Remuneration Committee (now our People & Remuneration Committee) to place greater focus on people and culture. We have dedicated more Board and committee time to the assessment of our top emerging risks, with the Audit Committee (now renamed the Audit & Risk Committee) ensuring that our overall approach to risk management at Board level is robust and effective. We also reframed the scope of work of our Sustainability Committee. The Committee will split its time between the critical task of closely monitoring our shorter-term environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance (including safety and tailings), while at the same time considering longer-term strategic issues on sustainability. Finally, in support of the objective to strengthen our social licence, we have stepped up our plans as a Board for stakeholder engagement in 2023 and beyond. Separately, we are also considering how we can bring additional and dedicated focus to enhancing the Group's social licence in key strategic countries.\n\nThe following pages set out in more detail the corporate governance arrangements we have in Rio Tinto. I am satisfied that these arrangements are robust and effective but, as set out above, we will continue to explore how we can find better ways for the Board and its committees to ensure the success of the business, for the benefit of shareholders and all of our other stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDominic Barton\n\nChair\n\n22 February 2023",

Non-Executive Directors are invited to provide the Board with any feedback from these engagements at each Board meeting.\n\nThe employee-listening sessions help the Board understand the concerns, views and ideas of our people in an informal and conversational setting. The following sessions took place during the year:\n\n- - In April 2022, Megan Clark, Simon McKeon and Ngaire Woods spoke with employees from the Change Partners Network, part of the Safe Production System (SPS), discussing inclusion and diversity and our culture, including the findings of the Everyday Respect Report .\n- - In June 2022, Simon Henry, Sam Laidlaw and Jennifer Nason spoke with our Mindsets and Behaviours Coaches and Change Champions of SPS on the successes, failures and areas of improvement of our processes.\n- - In October 2022, Megan Clark, Ngaire Woods and Ben Wyatt took part in a conversation with our people based in China to better understand their perspectives of our business.\n\nBoard members also recorded podcasts to give our people more of an insight into who they are, both professionally and personally. During 2022, our then Chairman, Simon Thompson, reflected on his tenure as a member of the Board, and a number of our Non-Executive Directors were interviewed on topical issues for our business.\n\nIn December 2022, all the Board members visited our Brisbane office for the final Board meeting of the year.

Here is a summary of the framework.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nWe are finding better ways to provide the materials the world needs.\n\nBy doing so efficiently, effectively and sustainably, we aim to create long-term value for all stakeholders.

        "page_content": "## Evaluating our performance\n\nIn line with the UK Governance Code and ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) (the ASX Principles), we undertake a formal annual evaluation of the Board and, every third year, we engage a professional external adviser to carry out an independent evaluation.\n\nIn practice, the Chair and the Non-Executive Directors schedule time at the end of each Board meeting, often with the Executive Directors, to reflect on the effectiveness of the suite of Board and committee meetings as part of a process of continuous improvement to the governance arrangements of the Board.\n\nAs set out in the Chair's introduction on page 89, we carried out a comprehensive governance review in 2022, based upon two key corporate governance priorities for 2022: a review of our composition as a Board to ensure that we have the right balance of skills and experience for the implementation of Rio Tinto's strategy; and a review of how to best spend our time in support of that new strategy in the context of greater uncertainty and potential risk.\n\nThe review comprised external benchmarking analysis of governance structures in peer and other long-cycle companies, including private equity firms, together with a questionnaire for directors on the Board's current effectiveness.\n\nThis evaluation questionnaire was more forward looking than the usual in-year annual evaluations. Given the timing of the strategic governance review, we decided it would be more beneficial to defer the independent third-party evaluation of the Board so that it could take place once these governance enhancements were fully embedded. Therefore, the third-party Board evaluation will now take place in 2023 with this year's forward-looking evaluation as the new baseline.\n\nIn July 2022, the Board discussed the findings of the governance review and agreed on a number of enhancements. To optimise the investment of our time, we have refreshed the Board's forward programme to ensure we are primarily focused on supporting the four strategic objectives. We have expanded the scope of our Remuneration Committee (now our People & Remuneration Committee) to place greater focus on people and culture, and we will dedicate more Board and committee time to the assessment of our top emerging risks, with oversight from the Audit Committee (renamed the Audit & Risk Committee). In support of the objective to strengthen our social licence, we have also stepped up our plans for stakeholder engagement in 2023 and beyond.\n\n## Directors' attendance at scheduled Board and committee meetings during 2022 1\n\n|                                      | Committee appointments   | Board   | Audit & Risk   | Nominations   | People &  Remuneration   | Sustainability 2   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------|\n| Chair and Executive Directors        |                          |         |                |               |                          |                    |\n| Simon Thompson - retired 5 May 2022  |                          | 3/3     |                | 2/2           | 2/2                      | 3/3                |\n| Dominic Barton - joined 4 April 2022 |                          | 6/6     |                | 3/3           | 2/2                      | 3/3                |\n| Jakob Stausholm                      |                          | 7/7     |                |               |                          |                    |\n| Peter Cunningham                     |                          | 7/7     |                |               |                          |                    |\n| Non-Executive Directors              |                          |         |                |               |                          |                    |\n| Megan Clark                          |                          | 7/7     |                | 4/4           | 5/5                      | 6/6                |\n| Hinda Gharbi - retired 8 April 2022  |                          | 2/2     | 2/2            | 2/2           |                          | 3/3                |\n| Simon Henry 2                        |                          | 7/7     | 6/6            | 3/4           |                          | 6/6                |\n| Sam Laidlaw                          |                          | 7/7     |                | 4/4           | 5/5                      | 6/6                |\n| Simon McKeon                         |                          | 7/7     | 6/6            | 4/4           | 5/5                      |                    |\n| Jennifer Nason 2                     |                          | 7/7     |                | 4/4           | 5/5                      | 3/3                |\n| Ngaire Woods                         |                          | 7/7     |                | 4/4           | 5/5                      | 6/6                |\n| Ben Wyatt 2,3                        |                          | 7/7     | 4/4            | 4/4           |                          | 3/3                |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Nominations Committee report\n\nAs part of our ongoing Board succession planning, we have been working intensely during the course of the year, and I am pleased to report on the progress we have made in the first eight months of my tenure as Chair.\n\nOur main priority as a Committee this year has been on ensuring the right balance of skills and experience in the boardroom to help deliver implementation of the Group's future strategy and objectives. This will enable us as a Board to anticipate and capture new opportunities as they emerge over the longer term, while also managing any shorter-term risks that may arise from a new global societal and industry context.\n\nWe currently have ten Board members, eight Non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors. I believe that the optimal size for a board responsible for overseeing a group of the scale, complexity and international reach as Rio Tinto should be around 12 for the longer term. As we continue to refresh the Board over this next period, it is likely that we will need to accommodate some variance above and below this optimal size, as we seek to bring in additional capability while maintaining the appropriate experience and expertise of our longer-serving Directors. Through this period of transition, our commitment to achieving the right diversity on the Board, including female and ethnic representation, will remain resolute, even if we find ourselves short on the relevant metrics in the immediate term.\n\n## Board refreshment\n\n## Criteria\n\nAfter a review of Board composition, led by the new Chair Dominic Barton, a number of areas were identified to strengthen Board composition, with a view to ensuring that the Board benefits from differing perspectives, experiences and skillsets in providing effective oversight and promoting the sustainable success of the business over the long term.\n\nThe Committee initiated the search for four new Non-Executive Directors and agreed to appoint the executive search firm, Spencer Stuart, to assist. The following areas of expertise were identified when searching for candidates:\n\n- - mining, operations and projects, preferably a former or current Chief Executive, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Technical Officer providing options for future Committee Chair succession;\n- - renewables and the energy transition;\n- - financial/accounting, strengthening the composition of the Audit & Risk Committee and providing options for future Committee Chair succession; and\n- - knowledge of key countries or regions of operational or strategic relevance to the Group, reflecting our geographic diversity, for example China and Africa.\n\nWe are planning to complete the refreshment of the Board by the time I report to you next year, and I look forward to updating you during the course of 2023 on the progress we are making.\n\nSeparately, we have introduced a number of other important enhancements regarding the Board's responsibility to monitor the health of our people and talent.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has ceded responsibility for the monitoring of succession planning of the Executive Committee to the full Board. The Board has launched a longer-term succession planning process for the Executive Committee. In December 2022, we had our first dedicated and extensive session and will now receive regular updates. In 2023, for example, the full Board will systematically monitor the progression of internal candidates as well as the external landscape, to ensure that we have robust plans for the long term, while also being prepared for any shorter-term eventualities.\n\nIn addition to the above criteria, the continued diversity of our Board composition, including with regard to gender and ethnicity, was identified as a key priority and all searches included a diverse pool of candidates in terms of gender, ethnicity, nationality, life experience and skillset. Over half of the candidates considered were women, and of all candidates, we had representation from six continents and 32 nationalities.\n\nAcross the four specifications, Spencer Stuart considered around 400 candidates before compiling long-lists of candidates in line with the criteria. These were presented to the Committee in July 2022. Prioritised candidates were endorsed by the Committee, and interested individuals were shortlisted. In total, five candidates have been interviewed by the Chair and other Board members.\n\nTechnology expertise was also identified as a potential additional skillset for the Board. After careful consideration, it was agreed to establish an Innovation Advisory Council to drive the critical consideration of research and development, science and technology projects for the Group rather than make this a further category of experience for the Board itself.\n\n## Candidate selection\n\nOn 19 December 2022, we announced that Kaisa Hietala had been appointed as a Non-Executive Director, with effect from 1 March 2023. Kaisa is an experienced executive with a strong track record of helping\n\nSeparately, we have expanded the remit of our Remuneration Committee, now renamed our People & Remuneration Committee, to include a deeper and more regular focus on people and talent within the wider organisation, as well as on how effective we are in embedding the cultural and leadership changes that have been introduced. Further details can be found on page 111 in the Remuneration report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dominic Barton\n\nNominations Committee Chair\n\n22 February 2023\n\ncompanies transform the challenges of environmental megatrends into business opportunities and growth. She is also an experienced Non-Executive Director and brings a deep understanding of renewables and sustainability from her knowledge of the resources industry, as well as commercial capability, all of which will be invaluable to our success in a decarbonising world.\n\nAs part of the continuing refresh of Board capabilities, the Committee is progressing well with the other categories, and we expect to announce further appointments in due course.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nabout our new Non-Executive Director, see the Board biographies on pages 90-91.\n\n## Nominations Committee members\n\n| Dominic Barton (Chair) 1   | Simon McKeon     |\n|----------------------------|------------------|\n| Megan Clark                | Jennifer Nason   |\n| Hinda Gharbi 2             | Simon Thompson 3 |\n| Simon Henry                | Ngaire Woods     |\n| Sam Laidlaw                | Ben Wyatt        |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Appointments to the Board - our policy\n\nWe base our appointments to the Board on merit, and on objective selection criteria, with the aim of bringing a range of skills, knowledge and experience to Rio Tinto. This involves a formal and rigorous process to source strong candidates from diverse backgrounds and conducting appropriate background and reference checks on the shortlisted candidates. We aim to appoint people who will help us address the operational and strategic challenges and opportunities facing the company and ensure that our Board is diverse in terms of gender, nationality, social background and cognitive style. As such, we engage only recruitment agencies that are signed up to the Voluntary Code of Conduct on diversity best practice.\n\nWhen recruiting government or former government officials to join the Rio Tinto Board, we comply with any restrictions and obligations existing pursuant to relevant laws and regulations, including with respect to confidentiality, lobbying and conflicts of interest. The timing and terms of the appointment of Dominic Barton during 2022 complied with all relevant restrictions and obligations.\n\nWe believe that an effective Board combines a range of perspectives with strong oversight, combining the experience of Directors who have developed a deep understanding of our business over several years with the fresh insights of newer appointees. We aim for our Board composition to reflect the global nature of our business. With the announcement of Kaisa Hietala's appointment, we will have seven different nationalities (including dual nationalities) on a Board of 11.\n\nMegan Clark has agreed to remain a Non-Executive Director for a further year and will stand for re-election at our 2023 annual general meetings. Megan is Chair of the Sustainability Committee and one of the longest serving Directors on our Board with significant mining industry experience. In this period of Board renewal, it is critically important that the Board continues to benefit from Megan's knowledge and experience. The Committee is of the view that Megan continues to make a significant and valuable contribution in the boardroom, and is satisfied that Megan continues to be independent.\n\nThe Committee engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for four new Non-Executive Directors, including Kaisa Hietala. The Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any connections with the company or individual Directors that may impair their independence.\n\nThe key skills and experience of our Board are set out on this page of the report.\n\nOur Diversity and Inclusion Policy sets out our expectations around the behaviours needed for an inclusive and diverse workplace. The policy is co-owned and supported by the Board and Executive Committee. At a Group level, we report against gender diversity targets (see page 24) and achievement of these targets contributes to the variable remuneration of senior executives. In addition, each of our operations has locally set employment targets. Their performance against these targets can be found in our 2022 Sustainability Fact Book .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For more information\n\nread our full policy on our website www.riotinto.com/sustainability/policies\n\n## Our key responsibilities\n\nThe purpose of the Nominations Committee is to review the composition of the Board. The Committee leads the process for appointments, making recommendations to the Board as part of succession planning for both Non-Executive and Executive Directors. It also approves proposals for appointments to the Executive Committee.\n\n## Membership of the Committee\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are members of the Nominations Committee.\n\nThe Chief Executive and the Chief People Officer are invited to attend all or part of meetings, as appropriate. The Committee is chaired by the Chair of the Board, unless the matter under consideration relates to the role of the Chair. During 2022, the former Chairman did not attend meetings where his succession was discussed.\n\nThe Committee had three formal meetings in 2022 and received regular and detailed updates, including over Board dinners, on the status of the various searches at each scheduled Board meeting. Attendance at the formal meetings is included in the table on page 101.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board recognises that it has a critical role to play in creating an environment in which all contributions are valued, different perspectives are embraced, and biases are acknowledged and overcome. The Board shares ownership with the Executive Committee of the Group's Inclusion and Diversity Policy, which can be found at riotinto.com/sustainability/policies. We also discuss diversity and inclusion in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report on page 59.\n\nThe proportion of women on the Board is currently 30% (three women and seven men). However, this will increase to 36.3% upon the appointment of our new Non-Executive Director, Kaisa Hietala, with effect from 1 March 2023. Gender diversity remains a key focus area as we continue to progress further new appointments to the Board with a view to regaining appropriate gender balance as we move forward. The Group has continued to set measurable gender diversity objectives for the composition of senior leadership and graduate intake. Progress on diversity is shown in the Sustainability section on pages 59-60, where we show a breakdown by seniority.\n\nThe number of Directors who identify themselves as being from a minority ethnic background is one (Ben Wyatt). Ensuring continued ethnic diversity on our Board has been a key consideration in our search for new Non-Executive Directors, as we have outlined on page 102.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProgress on diversity is shown in the Sustainability section on pages 59-60.\n\n## Length of tenure of Non-Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Skills and experience of the Chair and Non-Executive Directors\n\n| Area of expertise                       |                                                                                                                                              |   No. of  Directors |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Business leadership                     | Board-level experience in a major corporation.                                                                                               |                   6 |\n| Capital projects                        | Experience of developing large-scale, long-cycle capital projects.                                                                           |                   4 |\n| Financial                               | Proficiency in financial accounting and reporting, corporate finance, internal  controls, treasury and associated risk management.           |                   6 |\n| Mergers and  acquisitions               | Experience of mergers, acquisitions, disposals and joint ventures.                                                                           |                   6 |\n| Global experience                       | Work experience in multiple global locations, exposed to a range of political,  cultural, regulatory and business environments.              |                   8 |\n| Corporate  governance                   | Experience on the Board of a major corporation subject to rigorous corporate  governance standards.                                          |                   8 |\n| Government and  international relations | Interaction with governments and regulators or involvement in public policy  development and implementation.                                 |                   5 |\n| ESG/sustainability                      | Familiarity with issues associated with environmental and social responsibility,  including asset integrity and workplace health and safety. |                   5 |\n| Climate change                          | Knowledge and experience of climate-related threats and opportunities  including climate science, low-carbon transition and public policy.   |                   5 |\n| Communities and  social performance     | Experience of working with communities to optimise the benefits and  minimise negative impacts of business activities.                       |                   7 |\n| Marketing                               | Senior executive experience in marketing, and the development of product  and/or customer management strategies.                             |                   3 |\n| Mining                                  | Senior executive experience in a large, global mining organisation involved in  the discovery, development, operation and closure of mines.  |                   2 |\n| HR/remuneration                         | Experience of talent recruitment, retention, development and incentives.                                                                     |                   6 |\n| Technology/digital                      | Experience of managing research, development and innovation,  including digital technology.                                                  |                   3 |",

        "page_content": "## Audit & Risk Committee report\n\nIn 2022 the Committee's name was changed to the Audit & Risk Committee (previously Audit Committee), to more properly reflect the increasing role played in oversight and effectiveness of the company's risk management system. In addition to the normal cycle of reporting and reviews, the Committee's time was impacted by external developments in corporate governance and climate change issues.\n\nThe Committee has, as always, spent a considerable proportion of its time discussing the significant issues of judgment relating to the financial statements. In 2022, these included potential triggers for impairment charges and reversals, exclusions, closure provisions, and in particular the impact of climate change on our accounting and financial reporting. In each case, our work is focused on ensuring issues are identified early, the correct accounting judgments are made, and that these matters are appropriately disclosed in our financial reporting. Further detail on these issues is provided on page 105. In all cases, our deliberations included input and challenge from our external auditors, and together we review the effectiveness of the reporting processes annually to identify issues and improvements, including the performance of the external auditors.\n\nIn addition, the Committee considered reviews of our Group Internal Audit (GIA) function, and risk management and internal control processes, as part of its annual programme of work. I am pleased to confirm that both areas operated effectively in 2022. As part of our drive for continuous improvement and development of these key functions, some enhancements to their operations were identified as part of the review. The Committee fully supports these improvements to further strengthen GIA, risk management and our overall internal controls framework.\n\nWe also received a teach-in on the Group's performance management framework. The framework includes the processes and routines by which performance information is shared with senior management, the scope and content of this information, and the tools and systems used to capture, store and report it. We also had an overview of future developments in the context of planned finance strategy enhancements. We were impressed with the Management Information System (MIS), and the rigour and discipline it has brought to information management. We see this as critical to future development of both financial performance and the effective risk management and control in the company.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor the developing regulatory environment and to consider any potential changes to the Audit & Risk Committee's responsibilities. This monitoring will continue in 2023, when we expect the pace of regulatory developments, particularly in the UK, to quicken.\n\nIn April 2022, we said farewell to Hinda Gharbi who had served on the Committee since 2020. I would like to express my thanks to Hinda for her considerable contribution to our deliberations. In June 2022, we welcomed Ben Wyatt to the Committee, who has already become a valuable member.\n\nLastly, I would like to thank my fellow Committee members and those who support the work of the Committee.

        "page_content": "## Our main duties\n\nFinancial reporting - we review the key judgments needed to apply accounting standards and to prepare the Group's financial statements. We also review the narrative reporting that goes with them, with the aim of maintaining integrity in the Group's financial reporting. We also monitor exclusions made in deriving alternative (non-GAAP) (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) performance measures such as underlying earnings.\n\nExternal audit - we oversee the relationship with the external auditors and review all the non-audit services they provide and their fees, to safeguard the auditors' independence and objectivity. We also assess the effectiveness of the external audit and, when necessary, carry out a formal tender process to select new auditors.\n\nFramework for internal control and risk management - we monitor the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls, including those over financial reporting. We also oversee the Group's risk management framework.\n\nGroup Internal Audit (GIA) - we oversee the work of GIA, and its head, who reports functionally to our Committee Chair.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves - we oversee the reporting and assurance of mineral resources, and consider the impact on financial reporting.\n\nDistributable reserves - we provide assurance to the Board that distributable reserves are sufficient, and in the correct corporate entities, to support any dividend proposals.\n\nThese duties feed into an annual work plan that ensures we consider issues on a timely basis. The Committee has authority to investigate any matters within its remit. We have the power to use any Group resources we may reasonably require, and we have direct access to the external auditors. We can also obtain independent professional advice at the Group's expense, where we deem necessary. No such advice was required during 2022.\n\nThe Committee Chair reports to the Board after each meeting on the main items discussed, and the minutes of Committee meetings are circulated to the Board.\n\nWe had seven Committee meetings in 2022. Attendance at these meetings is included in the table on page 101. The Committee has met twice to date in 2023.\n\nThe Chair of the Board, the Chief Financial Officer, the Group Financial Controller and the heads of GIA and Risk regularly attend our meetings, as do the Chief Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate Affairs, and the Group Company Secretary. Other senior executives and subject-matter experts are invited as needed.\n\nThe external auditors were present at all of the Committee meetings during the year. The auditors review all materials on accounting or tax matters in advance of each meeting, and their comments are included in the papers circulated to Committee members. The audit partners also meet with our Committee Chair ahead of each meeting to discuss key issues and raise any concerns.\n\nThe Committee meets regularly in private sessions. We also hold regular private discussions with the external auditors. Management does not attend these sessions. The Committee Chair also has regular contact and discussions with these stakeholders outside the formal meetings.\n\n## Use of Committee meeting time in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant issues relating to financial statements\n\nThere were four significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements.\n\n| Matters considered                                                                    | Conclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Review of carrying value of   cash-generating units and  impairment charges/reversals | The Committee assessed management's determination of cash-generating units, review of impairment triggers, and consideration  of potential impairment charges and reversals over the course of the year. An impairment trigger was identified at the Boyne Smelter  cash-generating unit. The Committee considered the key judgments made by management, in particular the climate change  sensitivity and alignment of operating assumptions to the Paris Agreement. The Committee monitored the transaction with  Turquoise Hill Resources minority shareholders and considered the relevance of the transaction price and associated valuation  information with respect to the Oyu Tolgoi cash-generating unit.                          |\n| Application of the policy   for items excluded from   underlying earnings             | The Committee reviewed the Group's policy for exclusion of certain items from underlying earnings and confirmed the consistent  application of this policy year on year. The items excluded from underlying earnings comprised charges of $1.5 billion and income  of $0.7 billion. A reconciliation of underlying earnings to net earnings is presented in the Alternative Performance Measures section.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Estimate of provision for   closure, restoration and  environmental obligations       | The Committee reviewed the significant changes in the estimated provision for closure, restoration and environmental obligations  by product group and legacy management. The Committee received updates on closure studies completed in the period and  discussed with management the accounting policy for legacy sites. The impact of inflation in the period on the forecast underlying  cashflows for future closure costs was significant. The Committee reviewed the economic assumptions assessed by management  and confirmed the consistent application of the accounting policy. At 31 December 2022, the Group's balance sheet included a  provision for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations of $15.8 billion. |\n| Climate change                                                                        | The Committee received an overview of the work that management is undertaking in relation to climate change and the potential  financial reporting implications thereof. The Committee reviewed the climate change summary provided on pages 152-155 and  discussed with management the strategy and approach to climate change, the economic scenarios and the impact on our portfolio,  and the linkage to accounting judgments. The Committee was pleased to see the enhanced disclosure financial reporting  considerations of climate change throughout the financial statements and the emphasis given.                                                                                                                                |\n\n## Other focus areas in 2022\n\nIn addition to our scheduled workload, the Committee also:\n\n- - Received a teach-in on the Group's performance management framework, including a live demonstration of the MIS and an overview of future developments in the context of the finance strategy improvement work. The implementation of the MIS has transformed the way in which the Group stores and reports performance information. This has been accompanied by a redesign of our performance reporting rituals and routines, centred on the Monthly Performance Reviews, to provide a consistent and transparent understanding of operating and financial performance and support decision making.\n- - Considered an update on the OECD Pillar One and Two proposals to implement a new global tax framework involving a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions and application of a 15% global minimum tax.\n- - After a robust process, in early 2022 the Committee recommended to the Board that the draft 2021 Annual Report should be taken as whole, fair, balanced and understandable.\n- - Reviewed the quality and effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk management systems. The findings of the review were shared with the Sustainability Committee, which oversees a number of key corporate risks. This review included the effectiveness of the Group's internal controls over financial reporting, and the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with sections 404 and 302 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 . The Committee also considered reports from GIA, PwC and KPMG on their work in reviewing and auditing the control environment.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change-related financial reporting\n\nThe Directors have considered the relevance of the risks of climate change and transition risks associated with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement when preparing and signing off the Company's accounts. The narrative reporting on climate-related matters is consistent with the accounting assumptions and judgments made in this report. The Audit & Risk Committee reviews and approves all material accounting estimates and judgments relating to financial reporting, including those where climate issues are relevant. The Group's approach to climate change is supported by strong governance, processes and capabilities.\n\nIn developing our commodity price forecasts, as part of our annual process, we updated our scenarios and now focus on two core scenarios. They are used to generate a central reference case for commodity forecasts and valuations, used pervasively in our financial processes, including impairment testing, estimating remaining economic life, and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions, as was the case in the prior year.\n\nAt the UN Climate Summit in late 2022 (COP27), there was broad recognition that the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy is too slow to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C and that current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions. Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios, Fragmented Leadership and Competitive Leadership, is consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although our operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our two core scenarios do not. Given this, we also assess our sensitivity, and test the economic performance of our business against a scenario we have developed that reflects our view of the global actions required to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nOverall, based on our internally developed pricing outlooks, we do not envisage an adverse impact of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreementaligned sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, closure and rehabilitation provisions for our Group.\n\nDuring the year, the assessment performed under the new Physical Resilience Programme, together with our ongoing review processes, including impairment assessments, did not identify any material accounting impacts as a consequence of the physical risks associated with climate change.\n\nFor more information on climate change impact on our Group, see our 2022 Climate Change Report and page 63 in this report.\n\n## Contact with regulators during 2022\n\nDuring the year, the Company received a letter from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC)'s Corporate Reporting Review team advising their intention to include extracts from the Company's 2021 Annual Report and accounts as examples of best practice in their thematic reviews of 'TCFD disclosures and climate in the financial statements' and 'Judgments and estimates'. Without entering into substantive dialogue, they also made recommendations for improvements to our disclosures, which we have incorporated in this report. The SEC wrote to us regarding questions they had around our use of multiple performance metrics in our segmental reporting and our disclosure of share of profit after tax of equity-accounted units. At their request, we have reduced some of this voluntary information, including the removal of certain subtotals in the Financial Information by Business Unit. The scope of the review by the FRC was limited to reviewing the 2021 Annual Report and correspondence with management and does not provide assurance that the report and accounts are correct in all material respects.\n\n## External auditors\n\n## Engagement of the external auditors\n\nFor the 2022 financial year, KPMG are serving as our auditors. The UK entity of KPMG audits Rio Tinto plc, and the Australian entity audits Rio Tinto Limited. The UK audit engagement partner, Jonathan Downer, was appointed in March 2021 and the Australian partner, Trevor Hart, was appointed in 2020.\n\nWe agreed on the scope of the auditors' review of the half-year accounts, and of their audit of the full-year accounts, taking into consideration the key risks and areas of material judgment for the Group. We also approved the fees for this work and the engagement letters for the auditors.\n\n## Safeguarding independence and objectivity, and maintaining effectiveness\n\nIn our relationship with the external auditors, we need to ensure that they retain their independence and objectivity, and are effective in performing the statutory audit.\n\n## Use of the external auditors for non-audit services\n\nThe external auditors have significant knowledge of our business and of how we apply our accounting policies. That means it is sometimes cost-efficient for them to provide non-audit services. There may also be confidentiality reasons that make the external auditors the preferred choice for a particular task.\n\nHowever, safeguarding the external auditors' objectivity and independence is an overriding priority. For this reason, and in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard, the Committee ensures that the external auditors do not perform any functions of management, undertake any work that they may later need to audit or rely upon in the audit, or serve in an advocacy role for the Group.\n\nWe have a policy governing the use of the auditors to provide non-audit services. The cap on the total fees that may be paid to the external auditors for non-audit services in any given year is 70% of the average of the audit fees for the preceding three years. This is in line with the FRC's Ethical Standard. Non-audit assignments fall into two broad categories:\n\n- - Audit, audit-related or other 'pre-approved' services where we believe there is no threat to auditors' independence and objectivity, other than through the fees payable.\n- - Other services approved under delegated authority.\n\nWe apply different approval regimes to these areas of work. Approval of 'pre-approved' services is as follows:\n\n- - Up to $50,000: subject to prior notification to management, this work can be awarded.\n- - From $50,001 to $100,000: requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - Over $100,000 and with a tender process: if the external auditors are successful in the tender, the appointment requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - From $100,001 to $250,000 without a tender process: requires the Chief Financial Officer's approval.\n- - Over $250,000 without a tender process: requires the Committee's or Committee Chair's approval.\n\nIn each case, the nature of the assignment and the fees payable are reported to the Committee.\n\nThe Chief Financial Officer can approve other services up to the value of $50,000 and an aggregate value of no more than $100,000. Fees exceeding $100,000 in aggregate require approval from the Committee or the Committee Chair.\n\nAt the half-year and year-ends, the Chief Financial Officer and the external auditors report to the Committee on non-audit services performed and the fees payable. Individual services are also reported to the Committee at each meeting that have either been approved since the previous meeting, or that require approval for commencement following the meeting.\n\nNon-audit services provided by KPMG in 2022 were either within the predetermined approval levels or approved by the Committee and were compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors and the other requirements of the relevant Australian, UK and US regulations with the exception of the following matter: certain KPMG member firms provided local financial statement preparation and translation services, which are prohibited by UK ethical rules, to certain group entities over the period 2020 to 2022. The Committee has considered the administrative nature of the services, and noted that the services were provided after the group audit opinion was issued to entities that are not material to the Group. The Committee concluded that the provision of these services did not impair the independence of KPMG.",

        "page_content": "## Fees for audit and non-audit services\n\nThe amounts payable to the external auditors, in each of the past two years, were:\n\n|                                 | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|---------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Audit fees                      | 25.7       | 21.2       |\n| Non-audit service fees:         |            |            |\n| Assurance services              | 3.3        | 3.7        |\n| Taxation services               | 0.0        | 0.0        |\n| All other fees                  | 0.3        | 0.2        |\n| Total non-audit service fees    | 3.6        | 3.9        |\n| Non-audit: audit fees (in-year) | 14%        | 18%        |\n\nFor further analysis of these fees, please see note 38 on page 222.\n\nNone of the individual non-audit assignments was significant, in terms of either the work done or the fees payable. We have reviewed the non-audit work in aggregate. We are satisfied that neither the work done, nor the fees payable, compromised the independence or objectivity of KPMG as our external auditors.\n\n## Independence of the external auditors\n\nKPMG are required to provide a declaration to the Directors in relation to their compliance with the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the professional code of conduct for external auditors. A copy of this is on page 251.\n\nNo person who served as an officer of Rio Tinto during 2022 was a Director or partner of KPMG at a time when they conducted an audit of the Group.\n\n## Effectiveness of the external auditors\n\nWe review the effectiveness of the external auditors annually. We consider the results of a survey containing questions on the auditors' objectivity, quality and efficiency. The survey, conducted in June 2022, was completed by a range of operational and corporate executives across the business, and by Committee members.\n\nWe are satisfied with the quality and objectivity of KPMG's 2021 audit.\n\n## Appointment of the auditors\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the independence, objectivity and effectiveness of KPMG as external auditors in 2022 and in the year to date. We have recommended to the Board that KPMG should be retained in this role for 2023, which the Board supports.\n\nKPMG have indicated that they are willing to continue as auditors of Rio Tinto. A resolution to reappoint them as auditors of Rio Tinto plc will therefore be proposed as a joint resolution at the 2023 AGMs, together with a separate resolution seeking authority for the Committee to determine the external auditors' remuneration.\n\nSubject to the approval of the above resolution, KPMG will continue in office as auditors of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nWe review Rio Tinto's internal control systems and the risk management framework. We also monitor risks falling within our remit, especially those relating to the integrity of financial reporting. A summary of the business's internal control and risk management systems, and of the principal risks and uncertainties we face, is available in the Strategic report on pages 79-86.\n\nImportantly, responsibility for operating and maintaining the internal control environment and risk management systems sits at asset level. Leaders of our businesses and functions are required to confirm annually: that adequate internal controls are in place; that these are operating effectively and are designed to identify any failings and weaknesses that may exist; and that any required actions are taken promptly.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee also regularly monitors our risk management and internal control systems (including internal financial controls). We aim to have appropriate policies, standards and procedures in place, and ensure that they operate effectively.\n\nAs part of considering the risk management framework, the Committee receives regular reports from the Group Financial Controller, the Chief Legal Officer, Governance & Corporate Affairs, and the Head of Tax on material developments in the legal, regulatory and fiscal landscape in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Board, supported by the Audit & Risk Committee, has completed its annual review of the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems. This review included consideration of our material financial, operational and compliance controls. The Board concluded that the Group has an effective system of risk management and internal control. To further strengthen the Group's risk management and internal control systems, in 2023 the Board and Audit & Risk Committee will focus on ensuring the timely closure of audit and assurance findings.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe main features of our internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting are explained on page 141.\n\n## Internal audit programme structure\n\nGIA provides independent and objective assurance of the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems. It may also recommend improvements.\n\nWhile the head of GIA reports administratively to the Chief Financial Officer, appointment to, or removal from, this role requires the consent of the Audit & Risk Committee Chair. The head of GIA is accountable to the Chairs of the Audit & Risk and the Sustainability Committees, and communicates regularly with both.\n\nOur GIA team therefore operates independently of management. Its mandate is set out in a written charter, approved by the Audit & Risk Committee. GIA uses a formal internal audit methodology that is consistent with the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA)'s internationally recognised standards.\n\nWhen needed, the team brings in external partners to help achieve its goals. There is a clear policy to address any conflicts of interest, which complies with the IIA's standards on independence. This policy identifies a list of services that need prior approval from the head of GIA.\n\n## Governance of the annual plan\n\nEach year's internal audit plan is approved by the Audit & Risk Committee and the Sustainability Committee. The plan is focused on higher-risk areas and any specific areas or processes chosen by the committees. It is also aligned with any risks identified by the external auditors. Both committees are given regular updates on progress, including any material findings, and can refine the plans as needed.\n\n## Effectiveness of the internal audit programme\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee monitors the effectiveness of the GIA function throughout the year, with updates on performance at every meeting. In addition, this year PwC conducted an independent quality assessment of GIA, the results of which were reported to the Committee. The assessment concluded that GIA provides strong assurance to the Group, using a comprehensive methodology and thorough process guidance, with good practice evident. The assessment also provided some useful suggestions for further improvement to mature GIA to 'trusted adviser' level, which will be actioned. The last such assessment was completed in 2018.\n\nWe are satisfied that the quality, experience and expertise of GIA are appropriate for the business and that GIA was objective and performed its role effectively. We also monitored management's response to internal audits during the year. We are satisfied that improvements are being implemented promptly in response to GIA findings, and believe that management supports the effective working of the GIA function.",

This, in turn, enhances our social licence to operate in the communities and countries in which we work.\n\nThis year, we recorded our fourth straight year of zero fatalities at our managed operations. We review and learn from every incident that has the potential to result in a fatality. Despite our best efforts, our people continue to be injured at work, and we did not achieve our desired improvement in the number of injuries from the previous year. At the Sustainability Committee, we track our progress in analysing and learning from incidents to prevent them from happening again. Although we had no fatalities at our managed operations in 2022, tragically, there was a fatality at one of our non-managed marine operations. In a separate incident, another mariner suffered a permanent disabling injury. We continue to work with our partners in these operations to align their safety performance with our own.\n\nIn 2022, the Committee reviewed the progress with our safety maturity model (SMM), a key tool to develop and enhance our safety culture. We integrated contractor partners' safety maturity into our model and included leadership on health and environment. This year, we shifted the focus from our processes and rituals to the felt experience of our workforce. Our critical risk management (CRM) system, which is embedded in our SMM, enables us to verify that the appropriate controls are in place to prevent fatalities, and over 1.498 million verifications were completed this year to ensure controls were in place.\n\nWe are increasing our focus on psychosocial health and wellbeing in our business. During 2022, the Committee requested a report on the incidence of suicide amongst our workforce, which examined the unique risk factors for mental health associated with mining operations such as ours and what we can do better to support our people. In addition, the Committee is overseeing the implementation of recommendations and actions outlined in the deeply confronting Everyday Respect Report , which was commissioned to better understand and improve our workplace culture. The independent study by experts Elizabeth Broderick & Co. was released in February 2022, and included a recommendation to embed the principles of Everyday Respect into our SMM.\n\nThe Committee received updates on our progress towards implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), and personally met with each of the executives nominated in accordance with GISTM requirements as having accountability for the safety of tailings facilities within each of the Copper, Minerals, Aluminium and Iron Ore product groups, and across the Closure function.\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our business. To improve our governance and oversight of integrated risk, the Committee hears annually from our product group Chief Executives on their integrated strategies for management of sustainability risks and opportunities. This includes effectiveness of controls associated with these risks and how the risks and associated controls will change over time.\n\nThe Committee oversaw the implementation of all recommendations arising from the 2020 Rio Tinto Board review of cultural heritage management and the Inquiry into Juukan Gorge by the Australian Government's Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia. The Committee continues to oversee actions to strengthen our approach and processes for managing cultural heritage - both within our Australian operations and across our operations globally - and the rebuilding of respectful relationships with the Indigenous peoples on the lands on which we operate.\n\nThe Committee oversaw the rebuilding of a constructive relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, the ongoing rehabilitation works at Juukan Gorge, the progress on an agreement for a co-management of Country approach, and a comprehensive remedy agreement. The Committee also reviewed the progress made towards reaching modernised agreements with the Yinhawangka, Yindjibarndi and Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura peoples in the Pilbara and the Pekuakamiulnuatsh First Nation in Canada.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee has overseen the design of a new Communities and Social Performance (CSP) vision and strategic framework; the development of the Group's CSP targets for 2022-2026; improved transparency in reporting on CSP; and improvements to our CSP control framework. This includes improvements in capability and assurance, enhancements to our second- and third-line assurance activities, and revisions of Group documents, including the CSP standard and the cultural heritage management Group procedure for Australian businesses, as well as the codification of the core principles of the integrated heritage management process into Group-level frameworks.\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit (GIA) function undertakes reviews and reports to the Sustainability Committee on matters within the Committee's scope. In addition, the Group's auditors, KPMG, report to the Sustainability Committee on their assurance procedures over our 2021 sustainable development reporting.\n\nOther key areas of focus for the Committee in 2022 included deep dives into the major hazards and risks, including:\n\n- - Water: Reviewing our approach to water management and monitoring our progress against our water stewardship targets.\n- -  Environment and Health: Reviewing our strategic objectives to advance our approach to our environmental and health performance.\n- - Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) workplan: Receiving regular updates on environment, health, safety and security activities and reviewing the 2023-2024 workplan.\n- - Major hazards: Receiving updates from management on the implementation of the GISTM and implementation of the Group's underground safety standard, as well as updates on controls relating to Process Safety and Occupied Buildings, and Major Slope Geotechnical Events.\n- - Potentially fatal incidents (PFIs): Reviewing at each meeting PFIs occurring across the Group.\n\nSite visits are an important element of the work of the Committee, and this year our Committee members made individual visits to our Iron Ore operations at Brockman, West Angelas, Yandicoogina and Gudai-Darri in the Pilbara, Western Australia; our operations at Saguenay - Lac-Saint-Jean and Sorel-Tracy in Quebec, Canada; and in the US, our operations at Boron in California, Resolution Copper in Arizona, and our Kennecott copper operations in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their commitment and dedication, and thank all the executive leaders and specialists for their genuine effort and disciplined preparation for our Committee meetings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMegan Clark\n\nSustainability Committee Chair\n\n22 February 2023",

The deployment of the Safe Production System (SPS) continues at pace to build on our progress in improving efficiencies and effectiveness.\n\nThe organisation has made meaningful headway in its culture transformation and has taken considerable actions to rebuild trust. The recommendations of the Everyday Respect Report are being implemented and our second progress report on our Communities and Social Performance has been published with greater participation and increased feedback from Traditional Owner groups.\n\nRio Tinto continues to deliver its strategy with low carbon transition at its centre. In 2022, we announced a partnership with the Government of Canada to invest up to $537 million (C$737 million) over eight years to decarbonise our Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and to position the business as a centre of excellence for critical minerals processing. We joined low-carbon partnerships, including with Ford, Volvo, Nano One and Corona Canada. In Australia, we installed a 34MW solar farm at Gudai-Darri and are planning to invest $600 million in a further 230MW of solar power in the Pilbara.\n\nRio Tinto progressed its excel in development agenda to underpin growth. This has included commissioning major projects and advancing the next tranche of Pilbara mines with the Western Range and Rhodes Ridge developments. Beyond the Pilbara, Rio Tinto has also advanced the Simandou development in Guinea, an underground mining project at Kennecott, early works funding of the Rincon Lithium Project and continued progress at Oyu Tolgoi.\n\nThe company acquired the remaining shares in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ) thereby increasing our direct interest in the Oyu Tolgoi project to 66%.\n\nThese 2022 results were achieved despite a challenging and volatile landscape, particularly in the areas of labour and supply chain constraints, further exacerbated by exceptional levels of global inflation.\n\n## Incentives review to accelerate strategy and culture change\n\nOur current incentive plans have served us well and we believe that the general plan structure remains appropriate. However, as our strategy has evolved, so has the need for the incentive framework to support it. A thorough review of our incentives was undertaken in 2022 to ensure they reinforce our strategy and the culture change necessary to build sustainable performance.\n\nFor 2023, we have prioritised changes to the Group short-term incentive plan (STIP) and our performance framework. At its core is collective Rio Tinto success - doing things that deliver our four objectives in the right way. The design maintains the existing weighting on financial metrics with no changes to our current financial measures of underlying earnings and STIP free cash flow. The focus on best operator will be through the flexed component, as well as elements focused on safety, carbon reduction, diversity and inclusion. For 2023, we are also introducing measures to capture progress on excel in development and strengthen our licence to operate. The design is simplified, based upon one Group scorecard that will apply consistently to approximately 24,000 employees including the Executive Committee.\n\nWhile the changes to our STIP design are accommodated within the parameters of our existing Policy, I have engaged with shareholders and proxy advisers to explain the rationale for the design decisions made. The final design was adapted to reflect points raised during the consultation process. I would like to thank our shareholders and proxy advisers for making the time and providing valuable input to our discussions. More details of our new STIP design can be found on page 112.",

        "page_content": "With regards to the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), the current measure of relative total shareholder return (TSR) has been unchanged for many years. TSR is an important measure of success that aligns executives to the shareholder experience and against which we continue to track well. We will not be making any changes to the 2023 LTIP awards due to be granted in March but intend to return to it as part of the triennial policy review.\n\n## Overview of performance and strategic progress in 2022\n\n## Short-term incentive plan (STIP)\n\nThe STIP rewards employees for the past year's performance. In 2022, the STIP scorecard included ESG (including safety) and financial measures.\n\n## ESG (including safety) performance\n\nThe ESG component of STIP includes ambitious targets relating to safety, climate and decarbonisation, improving female representation, implementation of actions from the Everyday Respect Report , the Juukan Gorge Senate Inquiry Report, the 2020 Board Report, as well as the critical elements of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM).\n\nSafety is our number one priority, and we achieved our fourth consecutive fatality-free year in 2022. We have also maintained our all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) performance and enhanced our safety maturity model (SMM) assessment approach as our safety culture has evolved and matured.\n\nThere are elements of the ESG component where we delivered above-target outcomes, whereas in others, while results were encouraging, we fell short of target. The overall performance outcome of this component is 63.4% of maximum. More information about our ESG performance can be found on page 122.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nIn 2022, we saw significant movement in commodity prices amidst growing recession fears and a decline in consumer confidence. We remained focused on cost control throughout the year, but experienced cost pressures over and above general inflation from higher market-linked prices for raw materials, along with the impact of the Russia and Ukraine war causing energy market disruptions that resulted in higher energy prices. Operationally, we achieved slightly lower than expected production, mainly in the first half of 2022 including disruptions associated with COVID-19, resulting in labour supply constraints and delays in replacement projects in the Pilbara.\n\nAs a result, our reported 2022 financial results of underlying earnings of $13.3 billion and free cash flow of $9.0 billion were below plan. Free cash flow reflected underspend on development capital by $0.9 billion that is excluded from the free cash flow STIP measure. The under performance against financial targets is reflected in the outcome of Group financial performance at 29% of maximum. Further details on our financial performance can be found on page 121.\n\n## Long-term incentive plan (LTIP)\n\nThe performance period of the 2018 Performance Share Award (PSA) concluded in December 2022 and vests on 23 February 2023. The vesting outcome of the 2018 PSA is 100%. The Committee considered the vesting outcome in the round of underlying business performance as well as within the context of the consequence management framework which was introduced in 2021, and was satisfied that the outcome was fair and representative of the shareholder experience and that no discretion should be applied.\n\n## 2023 remuneration decisions\n\nAgainst the backdrop of ongoing high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty, the Committee is more cognisant than ever of the need to strike an appropriate and careful balance between fairness and competitiveness when making decisions about pay.\n\nIn recognition of the extraordinary inflationary pressures experienced globally in 2022, we provided a one-off mid-year salary adjustment to approximately 30,000 employees which ranged from 2% to 5% in our major countries. The Executive Committee did not receive this adjustment. Effective 1 March 2023, the Executive Committee will receive salary increases in line with the broader employee populations in their jurisdictions. In addition, Bold Baatar and Simon Trott will receive an additional increase in recognition of market positioning within the limits of the Policy.\n\n## People & Remuneration Committee\n\nSince 1 January 2023, the Committee is known as the People & Remuneration Committee. With the increasing importance of developing the talent, capability and diversity of the organisation in support of the culture change, the Board unanimously agreed that this Committee's scope will now formally include these areas in addition to remuneration. The expanded scope of the Committee reinforces the Board and organisation's commitment towards an inclusive and people-centred culture, a key enabler of our strategic ambitions. Further details of the Committee are set out on page 119.\n\n## Broader employee context\n\nThe Board continued to engage with employees throughout the year, as detailed on page 95. These engagements enable the Board to hear directly our people's views on pay. The disruptive impact brought about by increased living costs was a regular topic of engagement in 2022 and we responded by making meaningful and significant investments to ease the strain on employees via the one-off mid-year salary adjustment.\n\nThe median Chief Executive pay ratio of 52:1 is higher than in 2021, primarily due to the vesting of the first LTIP award granted to Jakob Stausholm when he joined the company in 2018.\n\nOur focus on pay equity is evident in our gender pay metrics, in which we continue to make progress. Pay equity is a key pillar of our annual remuneration approach. Gender diversity in senior management roles also remains a key aspect of our broader agenda on diversity and inclusion. Further details on equal pay and gender pay gap, together with a wider discussion on diversity and inclusion, are provided in the Sustainability section of this report on page 59.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nAs I have mentioned earlier, I met with several shareholders and institutions in 2022 in relation to the redesign of our STIP. In preparation for our upcoming triennial Remuneration Policy review, I also took this opportunity to explore initial views on what role alternative measures, for example decarbonisation and culture, might play in our LTIP moving forward. The Committee is mindful of the need to ensure there is focus on the Group's key strategic priorities, balanced against ongoing focus on shareholder returns, when measuring the outcomes of our long-term incentives for our executive team. These initial discussions were both positive and constructive, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue in preparation for our updated Policy that will be put forward for approval at the 2024 AGMs.\n\nAs always, I welcome shareholder feedback on our 2022 Directors' Remuneration report.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sam Laidlaw\n\nPeople & Remuneration Committee Chair\n\n22 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## 2023 short-term incentive plan redesign\n\nIn 2022, we undertook a review of our incentives and performance management framework grounded in a belief that to deliver our ambitious strategy, we need to change the way we work. We believe there is an opportunity for incentives to be aligned to our strategic priorities that focuses as much on 'how' we deliver as well as 'what' we deliver, and to be more engaging so that they are better understood by participants.\n\nWe are moving to a much simpler design, where the STIP for approximately 24,000 employees will be based upon one Group scorecard rather than the diversified scorecards previously operated across the business - this aligns the goals of all STIP participants which will aid the business in its pursuit of financial success driven by our four objectives.\n\nThe new STIP design maintains the existing weighting and measures on our Group financials while aligning with our four objectives - achieving impeccable ESG, excel in development, best operator and social licence - as well as people and culture.\n\nThe STIP redesign is underpinned by the following core principles:\n\n- - Alignment with strategy\n- - Reinforcing our values\n- - Simplification\n- - Collective achievement\n- - Transparency of targets, progress and outcomes\n\n## Alignment to strategy\n\nThe metrics in the STIP design are chosen to drive the implementation of our strategy and are based around our areas of focus: our four objectives together with the delivery of strong financial performance and accelerating our culture change.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\n## Reflection in scorecard\n\n| People and culture                 | Focuses on 'how' we do things as well as 'what' we achieve as a critical lever of accelerating our culture change and building an inclusive  workplace environment.   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Excel in development               | Measures progress in relation to exploration, studies and project execution.                                                                                          |\n| Impeccable ESG                     | Safety in all its aspects remains a key priority alongside progressing the work on our decarbonisation pathways towards achieving our 2030 ambition.                  |\n| Social licence                     | Measures our progress in building trust and meaningful relationships with our community of stakeholders.                                                              |\n| Best operator -  Flexed financials | Focuses on achievement of financial plan commitments.                                                                                                                 |\n| Unflexed financials                | Aligned to market conditions for our commodities.                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Group STIP outcome\n\nOur Group STIP is based on one scorecard for all eligible employees, focused on working together and how we deliver on our strategic priorities.\n\nIndividual performance will be assessed based on both the achievement of individual objectives ('what') and living our values and behaviours ('how'). The individual performance assessment may result in the Group STIP outcome being adjusted by +/- 25%.

The design is simple and intended to remove barriers to collaboration and encourages longer-term thinking. It also places new emphasis on 'how ' we achieve - which is as important as 'what ' we achieve.\n\nIf we are focused on the right things and working together to achieve them, Rio Tinto will perform better, benefiting all our stakeholders.\n\n## Group scorecard\n\nOur Group scorecard will be the same for all eligible employees and will track our progress against achieving our four objectives, our Group financial performance and acceleration of our culture change. It is weighted equally between our financial performance and strategic priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fatality deduction\n\nSafety is our number one priority and in the event of a fatality there will be deductions applied to the scorecard outcome.\n\nDifferentiation for the 'How' and 'What'",

It is a reset and beginning of a journey during which we anticipate our incentives to continue to evolve as we progress collectively and individually. The performance measures included in the scorecard are a mix of existing measures, new measures which require baselining, and existing measures that are being collectively incorporated into a STIP scorecard for the first time. As demonstrated over the past two years in relation to our ESG scorecard targets and outcomes within our previous STIP design, we remain fully committed to transparency, fair and rigorous target setting and assessment of outcomes. With that said, as we embed this significant change across 24,000 employees, it is important that we retain flexibility and are open to the exercise of judgment as provided for under our Remuneration Policy to address unintended and unforeseen factors as we track and assess progress during the year and at year-end. To this end, we will provide transparent disclosure of the strategic scorecard targets and outcomes in February 2024 as part of our 2023 remuneration-related disclosures.",

Such discretion will be exercised  judiciously and clearly disclosed and explained in the Implementation report.

Pay equity is reviewed and monitored through different lenses:\n\n- - In-depth pay equity analysis as part of the remuneration review process through which we manage pay equity from multiple perspectives including gender.\n- - Minimum global standards implemented across all countries to ensure the foundations of our total reward offerings meet levels determined by the Group irrespective of local market practices. Examples include global standards for parental leave and life assurance.\n\n## Ownership\n\n- - Promoting material participation in our all-employee share plan (myShare) to create stewardship and provide employees with access to building longer-term financial security.\n- - As at 31 December 2022, approximately 30,000 (2021: 25,000) of our employees across more than 30 countries are shareholders in the company.\n- - Employees invest approximately $19m (2021: $16m) in Rio Tinto shares every quarter through the myShare plan.\n- - Employees eligible for LTIP awards receive these as either MSA, vesting over three years and not subject to performance conditions, and/or PSA, which are performance-tested over five years.\n\n## Consistency\n\n- - Consistency in implementation of the Remuneration Policy is an enabler for transparency and fairness.\n- - The introduction of the new STIP design using one scorecard for around 24,000 employees, including executives, to support delivery of the strategy and a mindset shift in how we win going forward.\n\n## Wellbeing\n\n- - A one-off mid-year salary adjustment to support our employees in an unprecedented inflationary period of economic strain for many households globally.\n- - Industry and market-leading benefits programmes focused on holistic and integrated support for physical, mental and financial wellbeing.\n- - Benefits that can be tailored to suit different needs and life stages, including employee assistance, minimum standard for life, accident and disability insurances, medical plans and virtual care, health screening and prevention, and subsidised health and wellbeing services.\n\n## Security\n\n- - Reward principles that protect employee purchasing power globally.\n- - Accurate and timely payment of remuneration.\n- - Appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay at all levels.",

        "page_content": "## Implementation report\n\nThis Implementation report is presented to shareholders for approval at our AGMs. It outlines how our Policy was implemented in 2022, and the intended operation for 2023.\n\n## About our reporting\n\nAs our shares are listed on both the Australian and London Stock Exchanges, the information provided within our Remuneration report must comply with the reporting requirements of both countries.\n\nOur regulatory responsibilities impact the volume of information we provide, as well as the complexity. In Australia, we need to report on a wider group of executives, as described in the following paragraph. In addition, as set out in the summary table below, the two reporting regimes follow different methodologies for calculating remuneration.\n\nIn the UK, disclosure is required for the Board, including the Executive Directors. The Australian legislation requires disclosures in respect of 'key management personnel' (KMP), being those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group. Accordingly, our KMP comprise the Board, all product group Chief Executives, and the Chief Commercial Officer.\n\nThroughout this Remuneration report, KMP are collectively referred to as 'executives'. They are listed on page 127, with details of the positions held during the year and dates of appointment to those roles.\n\nThe single total figure of remuneration table on page 120 shows remuneration for our Executive Directors, gross of tax and in the relevant currency of award or payment.\n\nIn table 1a on page 131, we report information regarding executives in accordance with Australian statutory disclosure requirements. The information is shown gross of tax and in US dollars. The remuneration details in table 1a include accounting values relating to various parts of the remuneration package, most notably LTIP awards, and require a different methodology for calculating the pension value. The figures in the single total figure of remuneration table are therefore not directly comparable with those in table 1a. Where applicable, amounts have been converted using the relevant average exchange rates included in the notes to table 1a.\n\nIn table 1b on page 132, we report the remuneration of the Chair and the NonExecutive Directors. Certain information contained within the Remuneration report is audited, as outlined on page 135.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nThe Implementation report, together with the annual statement by the People & Remuneration Committee Chair, is subject to an advisory vote each year as required by UK legislation. Under Australian legislation, the Remuneration report as a whole is subject to an advisory vote. All remuneration-related resolutions will be voted on at the AGMs as Joint Decision Matters by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shareholders.\n\n## The differing approaches explained\n\nAs well as the difference in methodology for measuring remuneration, there are also key differences in how remuneration is reported in the UK and Australia.\n\n## UK\n\n## Australia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n## UK\n\n- - For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into fixed and variable elements.\n- - We report remuneration in the currency it is paid, for example, where a UK executive is paid in pounds sterling, remuneration is reported in pounds sterling.\n\n## Australia\n\n- - For reporting purposes, remuneration is divided into short- and long-term elements.\n- - All remuneration is reported in US dollars, so using the previous example, the UK executives' remuneration would be converted to US dollars using the average exchange rate for the financial year (except STIP, which is converted at the year-end exchange rate).\n\nThe table below summarises the elements of each component of remuneration, as well as the significant differences in the approaches to measurement.",

        "page_content": "## People & Remuneration Committee responsibilities\n\nEffective 1 January 2023, the Committee will be renamed to the People & Remuneration Committee to reflect its additional responsibilities to include people and culture matters in addition to remuneration. The Committee's responsibilities have been updated within our terms of reference to reflect the revised scope of responsibilities, which is reviewed annually. The terms of reference are published in the corporate governance section of riotinto.com.\n\nOur responsibilities include:\n\n## People\n\n- - Strategic workforce planning including talent, succession and development planning within the Group.\n- - Leadership development.\n- - Oversight of the Board's workforce engagement plan and implementation.\n\n## Culture\n\n- - Strategies to implement the Group's values and to progress implementation of the Everyday Respect Report recommendations.\n- - Strategies, initiatives and performance measures around organisational culture and desired behaviours.\n- - Diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n- - Determining the Group's remuneration strategy, policy and framework.\n- - Determining the remuneration of the Chair, Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Committee.\n- - Determining the mix and operation of the Group's short- and long-term incentive plans and ensuring alignment with the company's strategic objectives.\n- - Overseeing the operation of the Group's short- and long-term incentive plans for executives, including approving awards, setting performance criteria, and determining any vesting, and where necessary applying the consequence management framework to current and prior awards.\n- - Determining contractual notice periods and termination commitments, and setting retention and termination arrangements for executives.\n- - Determining awards under the Group's all-employee share plan.\n- - Responsible for the Annual Remuneration report and shareholder engagement on Remuneration Policy and implementation, and other related matters including gender pay.\n- - Reviewing workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment of incentives and rewards with culture, taking these into account when setting the Policy for Executive Director remuneration.\n- - Engagement and independence of external remuneration advisers.\n\nWe consider the level of pay and conditions for all employees across the Group when determining executive remuneration.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nThe members of the Committee during the year and to the date of this report were:\n\n| Sam Laidlaw   (Committee Chair)   | Dominic Barton (from  4 April 2022)   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Megan Clark                       | Simon McKeon                          |\n| Jennifer Nason                    | Simon Thompson  (to 5 May 2022)       |\n\n## How we work\n\nThe Group Company Secretary (or their delegate) attends meetings as secretary to the Committee. The Chief Executive, Chief People Officer and Head of Reward attend appropriate parts of the meetings at the invitation of the Committee Chair. No individual is in attendance during discussions about their own remuneration.\n\n## Independent advisers\n\nThe Committee has a protocol for engaging and working with remuneration consultants to ensure that 'remuneration recommendations' (being advice relating to the elements of remuneration for KMP, as defined under the Australian Corporations Act ) are made free from undue influence by key management personnel to whom they may relate. We monitored compliance with these requirements throughout 2022. Deloitte, the appointed advisers to the Committee, gave declarations to the effect that any remuneration recommendations were made free from undue influence by KMP to whom they related, and the Board has received assurance from the Committee and is satisfied that this was the case.\n\nDeloitte are members of the Remuneration Consultants' Group, and voluntarily operate under its Code of Conduct (the Code) in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The Code is based upon principles of transparency, integrity, objectivity, competence, due care and confidentiality. Deloitte has confirmed that they adhered to the Code throughout 2022 for all remuneration services provided to Rio Tinto. The Code is available online at remunerationconsultantsgroup.com.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Deloitte team is independent. During 2022, Deloitte's services also included attending Committee meetings, providing support on the new incentive design and giving advice in relation to management proposals and shareholder consultations. Deloitte was paid $545,620 (2021: $365, 777) for these services. Fees were charged on the basis of time and expenses incurred.\n\nWe received other services and publications relating to remuneration data from a range of sources. During the year, Deloitte also provided internal audit, tax compliance and other non-audit advisory services. These services were provided under separate engagement terms and the Committee is satisfied that there were no conflicts of interest.\n\n## How the Committee spent its time in 2022\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee met ten times. We fulfilled our responsibilities as set out in our terms of reference.\n\nOur work in 2022 included:\n\n- - Determining any base salary adjustments and LTIP grants for executives.\n- - Determining the targets for the 2022 STIP.\n- - Reviewed performance of the accountable executives for GISTM implementation.\n- - Reviewing performance against the 2021 STIP and 2017 PSA targets, including assessing applicable adjustments.\n- - Considering shareholder feedback on the remuneration-related resolutions for the 2022 AGMs.\n- - Determining the terms of appointment for the new Chair.\n- - Development of the STIP redesign, including consultation with shareholders and proxy advisers.\n- - Further refinement of the consequence management framework.\n- - Reviewing executives' progress towards the Group's share ownership requirements.\n- - Reviewing the strategy and annual reports on the Group's global benefit plans.\n- - Consideration of the 2022 mid-year salary adjustment for the broader employee workforce, noting that executives would not receive any adjustment.\n\n## Performance review process for executives\n\nWe conduct annual performance reviews for all executives. Our key objectives for the performance review process are to:\n\n- - Improve organisational effectiveness by creating alignment between the executive's objectives, Rio Tinto's strategy, the individual's leadership behaviours and the company's values.\n- - Provide a consistent, transparent and balanced approach to measure, recognise and reward executive performance.\n\nThe Chief Executive conducts the review for members of the Executive Committee and recommends the performance outcomes to the Committee. The Chief Executive's performance is assessed by the Chair of the Board and it is discussed and considered with the Committee and the full Board. Performance reviews for all executives took place in 2022 and early 2023.",

These estimates are restated in the following year, once actual values are known. Refer to page 125 for further detail.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\n## Base salary\n\nConsistent with prior practice, Executive Director base salary increases are in line with that awarded to the wider employee population. Base salaries are reviewed with a 1 March effective date. During 2022, we provided a mid-year salary adjustment in order to recognise unprecedented inflation levels, which resulted in salary increases between 2% to 5% for eligible employees in our major jurisdictions. The Executive Directors did not participate in this mid-year salary adjustment.\n\n| Executive Director   | Annual base salary  1 January 2022  \u00a3'000   | Annual base salary from  1 March 2022  \u00a3'000   | Annual base salary  at 1 March 2023  \u00a3'000   | % change   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Jakob Stausholm      | 1,150                                       | 1,182                                          | 1,235                                        | 4.5%       |\n| Peter Cunningham     | 700                                         | 700                                            | 732                                          | 4.5%       |\n\n## Benefits (2022)\n\nIncludes healthcare, allowance for professional tax compliance services, occasional spouse travel in support of the business which is deemed to be taxable to the individual, and non-performance based awards under the all-employee share plans.\n\n## Pension (2022)\n\nPension benefits can either be paid as contributions to Rio Tinto's company pension fund or as a cash allowance.\n\n| Executive Director   |   Pension contributions paid to  the Rio Tinto pension fund  \u00a3'000 |   Cash in lieu of pension   contributions paid  \u00a3'000 |   Total  \u00a3'000 | Pension provision as  percentage of base salary   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Jakob Stausholm      |                                                                  4 |                                                   161 |            165 | 14%                                               |\n| Peter Cunningham     |                                                                  4 |                                                    94 |             98 | 14%                                               |",

Three adjustments were approved which were associated with circumstances which were deemed not to reflect performance during the year. These relate to the settlement paid to the Australian Tax Office for all tax matters in dispute; the effect of higher than expected inflation on our closure liabilities which resulted in higher non-cash charges to underlying earnings; and the settlement of foreign exchange derivatives associated with the Group's dividends which significantly impacted the Group's free cash flow.",

Commentary on ESG measures\n\nIn 2022, the STIP was simplified to combine all ESG measures (including safety) into a single ESG scorecard. The weighting for safety and other ESG metrics remained consistent with 2021.\n\nOn safety, for a fourth consecutive year in 2022, we achieved zero fatalities.\n\nThe all-injury frequency rate (AIFR) of 0.40 in 2022 was at the same level as the previous year.\n\nThe SMM was introduced to the business in 2019 and is now in the fourth consecutive year of implementation. As the SMM progressed in its evolution and maturity, a series of enhancements were made in 2022 to the SMM assessment approach after comprehensive review and engagement with stakeholders. The enhancements included shifting the focus from verifying systems and rituals to assessing the quality and impact of the model on our people's mindsets to drive safer decision making; integration of contractor partners in the application of the model ensuring safety and inclusion for both employees and contractors at Rio Tinto; adding an element to the model focused on operational ownership of environment and health risks to support our goal of impeccable ESG credentials; and elevating focus on quality pre-shift meetings, first party assurance, management of change and systemic factors in incident investigations. The SMM enhancements reset our target expectations around safety maturity which necessitated a reset of the baseline scores. In order to reset, we sample tested sites against the updated criteria in Q4 2021. Following which, it was determined to reduce baseline scores by 1.5 which formed the basis of the 2022 targets.\n\nOn environment, we took important foundational steps to advance towards our ambitious climate change targets by approving abatement projects and progressing our Scope 3 partnership strategy. The delivery of goals to progress our Scope 3 partnerships included commencement of phase 2 of a green hydrogen production study in Eastern Canada; completed laboratory test work on low carbon research project and approval to move to pilot phase; developed a work plan for lower carbon production process and a technology deployment plan across RTA smelters; and implemented tracking processes to enhance visibility and oversight of shipping related emissions.\n\nWe fell short of target for the Scope 1 and 2 abatement projects but exceeded our delivery of goals to progress Scope 3 partnerships. The main drivers for the shortfall to threshold on the Scope 1 and 2 abatement projects are our Iron Ore project commissioning and approval delays, and Minerals delays.\n\nOn social, our aspiration is to foster an environment where all aspects of diversity are represented, included, and respected. The target related to improving representation of women in the workforce by at least 2% and implementation of actions from Everyday Respect Report . For representation of women in the workforce, we achieved 1.4% which fell short of target but it is noted that representation of women has increased from 17.7% in 2018 to 22.9% in 2022. In implementing the recommendations of the Everyday Respect Report during the year, we trained 91% of our leaders and completed our facilities review and rectified the urgent safety risks.\n\nOn governance, our efforts in 2022 were focused on the actions from the Senate Inquiry Interim and 2020 Board Report alongside critical elements of the 2022 plan to implement the GISTM. We achieved outcomes between target and outstanding for both components. In the implementation of the actions from the Senate Inquiry Interim and 2020 Board Report, we focused on the completion of an Independent Cultural Heritage Management Audit, our 2022 communities and social performance (CSP) standard and implementation of cultural heritage controls. With regards to the critical elements of the 2022 plan for GISTM implementation, the teams completed all asset gap analyses and had no tailings incidents with off-lease impacts, and partially completed the asset work plans to close gaps for 'very high' and 'extreme' consequence facilities.",

The value of the shares vesting included in the single total figure of remuneration table for 2022 is an estimate, with the actuals determined when share price on vesting is known.\n\nThe disclosed value is based on:\n\n- - The approved TSR outcome relative to the EMIX Global Mining Index and MSCI World Index (with associated dividend equivalent shares).\n- - The average share prices for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited over the last quarter of the five-year performance period (Q4 2022).\n- - The actual value associated with the 2018 PSA vesting will be disclosed in the 2023 Remuneration report.",

The Committee is aware that IHS Markit, the provider of the EMIX Global Mining Index, is conducting a consultation on the cessation of the EMIX indices, including the EMIX Global Mining Index. In the event that the EMIX Global Mining Index is discontinued, the Committee will review and determine an appropriate approach to measuring TSR performance relative to sector peers for the 2023 PSAs as well as in-flight awards. In line with best practice principles, the Committee will seek to ensure that any changes result in a fair outcome for both shareholders and participants with performance targets being of a commensurate stretch as the existing targets. Further disclosure will be provided in due course.\n\n## Executive Directors' shareholding\n\nIn line with our share ownership policy, Executive Directors' shareholdings are calculated using the closing price of Rio Tinto shares on 31 December 2022.\n\n|                    | Multiple of base salary   | Multiple of base salary   | Multiple of base salary           | Holding of ordinary shares   | Holding of ordinary shares   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Executive Director | 31 December  2022         | Guidelines                | Year requirement  needs to be met | 31 December  2022            | 31 December  2021            |\n| Jakob Stausholm    | 3.3                       | 4.0                       | 2024                              | 56,337                       | 33,832                       |\n| Peter Cunningham   | 4.6                       | 3.0                       | 2026                              | 52,815                       | 35,631                       |\n\nThe multiple of base salary shown above includes the value of 50% unvested BDA held.\n\nAll past directors subject to post-employment shareholding requirements continue to meet their requirements.\n\n## Service contracts\n\n| Executive Director   | Position held during 2022   | Date of appointment to position   | Notice period   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Jakob Stausholm      | Chief Executive             | 1 January 2021                    | 12 months       |\n| Peter Cunningham     | Chief Financial Officer     | 17 June 2021                      | 12 months       |\n\nEither party can terminate their contract with notice in writing, or immediately by the company by paying the base salary only in lieu of any unexpired notice.\n\n## Executives' external and other appointments\n\nNeither of the Executive Directors currently has an external directorship.\n\n## Past Director payments\n\nThere were no payments to past Directors in excess of the de-minimis threshold of \u00a315,000.",

It uses the same methodology as that used to calculate the vesting for the PSA granted in 2018 with a performance period that ended on 31 December 2022.\n\n## Total shareholder return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. TSR for the MSCI and EMIX indices has been calculated using 12-month average Return Index data for the year sourced from DataStream.\n- 2.  Rio Tinto's Group TSR has been calculated using a weighted average for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. The weighting is based on the free-float market capitalisation of each entity as at the start of the period.\n\nThe following graph illustrates the TSR performance of the Group against the EMIX Global Mining Index and the MSCI World Index over the ten years to the end of 2022.\n\nThe graph meets the requirements of Schedule 8 of the UK Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and is not an indication of the vesting of PSA granted in 2018.\n\n## Total shareholder return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. TSR has been calculated using spot return index data as at the last trading day for the year sourced from DataStream. The indices chosen are those used for measuring PSA performance.\n- 2.  Rio Tinto's Group TSR has been calculated using a weighted average for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited. The weighting is based on the free-float market capitalisation of each entity as at the start of the period.\n\nThe effect of performance on the value of shareholdings, as measured by TSR delivered over the past five years, based on the sum of dividends paid and share price movements during each calendar year, is detailed in the table below.\n\n|      | Underlying  earnings   | Dividends paid  per share   | Share price -  Rio Tinto plc pence   | Share price -  Rio Tinto plc pence   | Share price -  Rio Tinto Limited A$   | Share price -  Rio Tinto Limited A$   | TSR     |\n|------|------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Year | $ millions             | $ cents                     | 1 Jan                                | 31 Dec                               | 1 Jan                                 | 31 Dec                                | Group % |\n| 2018 | 8,808                  | 307.0                       | 3,942                                | 3,730                                | 75.81                                 | 78.47                                 | (4.5%)  |\n| 2019 | 10,373                 | 635.0                       | 3,730                                | 4,503                                | 78.47                                 | 100.40                                | 38.7%   |\n| 2020 | 12,448                 | 386.0                       | 4,503                                | 5,470                                | 100.40                                | 113.83                                | 34.0%   |\n| 2021 | 21,380                 | 963.0                       | 5,470                                | 4,892                                | 113.83                                | 100.11                                | (3.7%)  |\n| 2022 | 13,275                 | 746.0                       | 4,892                                | 5,798                                | 100.11                                | 116.41                                | 18.3%   |\n\nThe data presented in this table reflects the dual corporate structure of Rio Tinto.

Variations may occur in instances in which an individual has changed position, or the position's duties and responsibilities have been enlarged for example as a result of a reorganisation or acquisition, or where an individual's remuneration has fallen below comparable positions' market remuneration.\n\nIn recognition of the extraordinary inflationary pressures experienced globally in 2022, we provided a one-off mid-year salary adjustment to approximately 30,000 employees which ranged from 2% to 5% in our major countries. The Executive Committee did not receive this adjustment. Effective 1 March 2023, the Executive Committee will receive salary increases in line with the broader employee population in their jurisdictions. In addition, Bold Baatar and Simon Trott will receive an additional increase in recognition of market positioning within the limits of the Policy.\n\n## STIP\n\n## Overview of 2022 STIP weightings and measures\n\nThe following table shows the measures and weightings used to determine STIP awards for executives in 2022.\n\n|                                                                                                                     | Weighting for Executive  Directors and Group executives   | Weighting  for PGCEs   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Financial measures split equally between underlying earnings and STIP free cash flow for the Group                  | 50%                                                       | 20%                    |\n| Financial measures split equally between underlying earnings and STIP free cash flow for the relevant product group | 0%                                                        | 30%                    |\n| ESG including safety                                                                                                | 35%                                                       | 35%                    |\n| Individual measures based on key strategic initiatives of each role and contribution to overall company performance | 15%                                                       | 15%                    |\n\nThe 2022 STIP awards are detailed in the table below.\n\n|                 |                               |                                        |                          | Percentage of:        | Percentage of:          |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n|                 | 2022 STIP award (% of salary) | Adjusted 2022 STIP award (% of salary) | 2022   STIP award ('000) | Maximum STIP  awarded | Maximum STIP  forfeited |\n| Bold Baatar     | 97.2%                         | 97.2%                                  | \u00a3600                     | 48.6%                 | 51.4%                   |\n| Alfredo Barrios | 88.4%                         | 88.4%                                  | S$992                    | 44.2%                 | 55.8%                   |\n| Sinead Kaufman  | 98.6%                         | 98.6%                                  | A$1,006                  | 49.3%                 | 50.7%                   |\n| Simon Trott     | 101.8%                        | 101.8%                                 | A$1,100                  | 50.9%                 | 49.1%                   |\n| Ivan Vella      | 77.6%                         | 77.6%                                  | C$776                    | 38.8%                 | 61.2%                   |",

A minimum shareholding requirement of 300% of base salary applies on appointment to be built up over subsequent years.\n\n## Executive departures\n\nNo executives ceased employment in 2022.\n\n## Broader employee disclosures\n\n## Chief Executive pay ratio\n\nThe ratio of the single total figure of remuneration for the Chief Executive to the lower quartile, median and upper quartile Rio Tinto Australian employee population for 2022 is set out in the table below.\n\n|        |   Lower quartile |   Median |   Upper quartile |\n|--------|------------------|----------|------------------|\n| 2022   |               76 |       52 |               42 |\n| 2021 1 |               49 |       32 |               26 |\n\nThe median CEO pay ratio of 52:1 is higher than last year, primarily due to the first vesting of Jakob's LTIP award from 2018 which vested at the end of the 2022 performance year. The Committee continues to be mindful of the relationship between executive remuneration and that of our broader workforce. The Committee's decision making will continue to be supported by regular and detailed reporting on these matters.\n\nAs the company employs fewer than 250 employees in the UK, this analysis has been provided on a voluntary basis.\n\n## Relative spend on remuneration\n\nThe table below shows our relative spend on remuneration across our global employee population and distributions to shareholders in the year.

Following this review, it was determined that all fees and travel allowances should remain unchanged.\n\nThe additional \u00a310,000 allowance for eligible Australian Directors is to compensate them for additional UK National Insurance contributions which, unlike Directors based in other jurisdictions, they are not able to offset against their local tax payments.\n\n## Change in Director and employee pay\n\nIn the table below, we compare the changes annual from in salary, benefits and annual incentives of the Directors for the past two years, to that of the Australian employee population.

Dominic Barton joined the Board on 4 April 2022.\n\n## Other statutory disclosures\n\n## Other share plans\n\n## All-employee share plans\n\nThe Committee believes that all employees should be given the opportunity to become shareholders in our business, and that share plans help engage, retain and motivate employees over the long term. Rio Tinto's share plans are therefore part of its standard remuneration practice, to encourage employee share ownership and create alignment with the shareholder experience. Executives may participate in broadbased share plans that are available to Group employees generally and to which performance conditions do not apply.\n\nA global employee share purchase plan is normally offered to all eligible employees unless there are local jurisdictional restrictions. Under the plan, employees may acquire shares up to the value of $5,250 (or equivalent in other currencies) per year or capped at 15% of their base salary if lower. Each share purchased will be matched by the company, providing the participant holds the shares, and is still employed, at the end of the three-year vesting period.\n\nApproximately 30,000 (59%) of our employees are shareholders as a result of participating in these plans. In the UK, these arrangements are partially delivered through the UK Share Plan which is a UK tax approved arrangement. Under this plan, eligible participants may also receive an annual award of Free Shares up to the limits prescribed under UK tax legislation.\n\n## Management Share Awards (MSA)\n\nThe MSA are designed to help the Group attract the best staff in a competitive labour market, and to retain key individuals as we deliver our long-term strategy. MSA are conditional awards that are not subject to a performance condition. They vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment. Shares to satisfy the awards are bought in the market or re-issued from treasury. Executive Committee members are not eligible for the MSA after appointment.\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nIn the table below, we set out the results of the remuneration-related resolutions voted on at the Group's 2022 AGMs.\n\n| Resolution                 | Votes for   | Votes   against   | Votes withheld 1   |\n|----------------------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Approval of the Directors' | 96%         | 4%                | 11,499,374         |\n| Remuneration report:       |             |                   |                    |\n| Implementation report      |             |                   |                    |\n| Approval of the            | 97%         | 3%                | 22,272,424         |\n| Remuneration Policy (2021) |             |                   |                    |\n| Approval of the Directors' | 96%         | 4%                | 12,359,627         |\n| Remuneration report        |             |                   |                    |\n\n- 1.

'Table 1a - Executives' remuneration' is reported in US$ using A$1 = US$0.69493; \u00a31 = US$1.23715; C$1 = US$0.76899 S$1 = US$0.72550 (2022 average rates), except for cash bonuses which use A$1 = US$0.67655; \u00a31 = US$1.20535; C$1 = US$0.73700; S$1 = US$0.74311 (2022 year-end rates).\n- 2.  'Cash bonus' relates to the cash portion of the 2022 STIP award to be paid in March 2023.\n- 3.  'Other cash-based benefits' typically includes cash in lieu of company pension or superannuation contributions.\n- 4.  'Non-monetary benefits' for executives include healthcare coverage, professional tax compliance services/advice, flexible perquisites and, where relevant, accruals for annual and long service leave.\n- 5.  'Non-monetary benefits' for executives living outside their home country include international assignment benefits comprising, where applicable, housing, relocation expenses, tax equalisation and related compliance services, assignee and family home leave trips and international assignment payments made to and on their behalf.\n- 6.  The details for 2021 reflect remuneration for the period 1 January to 31 December 2021 which includes both KMP roles as Acting Chief Financial Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n- 7.  The value of share-based awards has been determined in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment'. The fair value of awards granted as MSA, BDA and PSA have been calculated at their dates of grant using valuation models provided by external consultants, Lane Clark and Peacock LLP, including an independent lattice-based option valuation model and a Monte Carlo valuation model which take into account the constraints on vesting attached to these awards. Further details of the valuation methods and assumptions used for these awards are included in note 41 (Share-based Payments) in the financial statements. The fair value of other share-based awards is measured at the purchase cost of the shares from the market. The share-based values disclosed in this table do not reflect amounts actually paid in 2022 or the value of shares that will ultimately vest.\n- 8.  'BDA' represents the portion of the 2019-2022 STIP awards deferred into Rio Tinto shares.\n- 9.  'Others' includes the Global Employee Share Plan (myShare) and the UK Share Plan.\n- 10. The costs shown for defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical benefits are the service costs attributable to the individual, calculated in accordance with IAS 19. The cost for defined contribution plans is the amount contributed in the year by the company.\n- 11.  'Total remuneration' represents the disclosure of total emoluments and compensation required under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and applicable accounting standards.\n\nFurther details in relation to aggregate compensation for executives, including directors, are included in note 29 (Directors' and key management remuneration).",

The remuneration is reported in US$. The amounts have been converted using the relevant 2022 average exchange rates of \u00a31 = US$1.23715 and A$1 = US$0.69493 (1 January to 31 December 2022 average).\n- 2.  'Fees and allowances' comprises the total fees for the Chair and all Non-Executive Directors, and travel allowances for the Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chair). The payment of statutory minimum superannuation contributions for Australian Non-Executive Directors is required by Australian superannuation law. These contributions are included in the 'Fees and allowances' amount disclosed for Australian Non-Executive Directors.\n- 3.

        "page_content": "## Statutory Audit Services Order\n\nThe Group has fully complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order.\n\n## Political donations\n\nRio Tinto prohibits the use of its funds to support political candidates or parties. No political donations were made by the Group for political purposes during the year. In the US, in accordance with the United States Federal Election Campaign Act , we provide administrative support for the Rio Tinto America Political Action Committee (PAC), which was created in 1990 and encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All Rio Tinto America PAC employee contributions are reviewed for compliance with federal and state law and are publicly reported in accordance with US election laws. The PAC is controlled by neither Rio Tinto nor any of its subsidiaries, but instead by a governing board of five employee members on a voluntary basis. In 2022, contributions to Rio Tinto America PAC by 13 employees amounted to $6,158.80, and Rio Tinto America PAC donated $23,500 in political contributions in 2022.\n\n## Government regulations\n\nOur operations around the world are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed by local, state, provincial and federal governments. In addition to these laws, several of our operations are governed by specific agreements made with governments, some of which are enshrined in legislation.\n\nThe geographic and product diversity of our operations reduces the likelihood of any single law or government regulation having a material effect on the Group's business as a whole.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nRio Tinto is subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries where it has operations. Rio Tinto measures its performance against environmental regulation by tracking and rating incidents according to their actual environmental and compliance impacts using five severity categories (minor, medium, serious, major or catastrophic). Incidents with a consequence rating of major or catastrophic are of a severity that requires notification to the relevant product group Chief Executive and the Rio Tinto Chief Executive immediately after the incident occurring. In 2022, there were no environmental incidents at managed operations with a major or catastrophic impact.\n\nDuring 2022, eight managed operations incurred fines amounting to $109,782 (2021: $7,414). Details of these fines are reported in the Sustainability section of this report on page 70.\n\nAustralian corporations that exceed specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or energy use thresholds have obligations under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (NGER). All Rio Tinto entities covered under this Act have submitted their annual NGER reports by the required 31 October 2022 deadline.\n\nFurther information on the Group's environmental performance is included in the Sustainability section of this Annual Report , on pages 46-75, and at riotinto.com.\n\n## Energy efficiency action\n\nDetails of the measures taken to increase the company's energy efficiency are reported on pages 50, 63 and 80-81 of this report.\n\n## Energy consumption 1, 2, 3\n\n| Energy consumption in GWh                                                          | 2022    | 2021 5   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|\n| From activities including the  combustion of fuel and the  operation of facilities | 84,911  | 83,424   |\n| From the net purchase of  electricity, heat, steam or cooling                      | 25,256  | 26,003   |\n| Total energy consumed 4                                                            | 110,167 | 109,428  |\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (in million t CO 2 e) 6, 7, 8\n\n|                                                             |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 9                                                   |   22.8 |   22.8 |\n| Scope 2 10                                                  |    7.5 |    8.2 |\n| Net GHG emissions 11                                        |   30.3 |   31   |\n| Operational emissions intensity  (tCO2e/t Cu-eq)(equity) 12 |    6.2 |    6.3 |\n\n## Exploration, research and development\n\nThe Group carries out exploration, research and development, described in the Innovation section on pages 34-35. Exploration and evaluation costs, net of any gains and losses on disposal, generated a net loss before tax of $896 million (2021: $719 million). Research and development costs were $76 million (2021: $65 million).\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the Group's financial risk management objectives and policies, and exposure to risk, are described in note 24 to the financial statements.\n\n## Dealing in Rio Tinto securities\n\nRio Tinto securities dealing policy restricts dealing in Rio Tinto securities by Directors and employees who may be in possession of inside information. These individuals must seek clearance before any proposed dealing takes place.\n\nOur policy also prohibits such persons from engaging in hedging or other arrangements that limit the economic risk in connection to Rio Tinto securities issued, or otherwise allocated, as remuneration that are either unvested, or that have vested but remain subject to a holding period. We also impose restrictions on a broader group of employees, requiring them to seek clearance before engaging in similar arrangements over any Rio Tinto securities.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial period that give a true and fair view of the state of the Group at the end of the financial period, together with profit or loss and cash flows for that period. This includes preparing financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, applicable UK law ( Companies Act 2006 ), Australian law ( Australian Corporations Act 2001 ) as amended by the ASIC class order and preparing a Remuneration report that includes the information required by Regulation 11, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (as amended) and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nIn addition, the UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that the Board provides a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects in its external reporting.\n\nRio Tinto's management conducts extensive review and challenge in support of the Board's obligations, aiming to strike a balance between positive and negative statements and provide good linkages throughout the Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "The Directors were responsible for the preparation and approval of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. They consider the Annual Report , taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced and understandable, and that it provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, in accordance with UK and Australian legislation. They have a general responsibility to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are also responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems are in place to maintain and preserve the integrity of the Group's website.\n\nLegislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from current and future legislation in other jurisdictions. The work carried out by the Group's external auditors does not take into account such legislation and, accordingly, the external auditors accept no responsibility for any changes to the financial statements after they are made available on the Group's website.\n\nThe Directors, senior executives, senior financial managers and other members of staff who are required to exercise judgment while preparing the Group's financial statements, are required to conduct themselves with integrity and honesty and in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as are all Group employees.\n\nThe Directors consider that the 2022 Annual Report presents a true and fair view and has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, using the most appropriate accounting policies for Rio Tinto's business, and supported by reasonable judgments and estimates. The accounting policies have been consistently applied as described on pages 148-155, and Directors have received a written statement from the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer to this effect. In accordance with the internal control requirements of the Code and the ASX Principles, this written statement confirms that the declarations in the statement are founded on a sound system of risk management and internal controls, and that the system is operating effectively in all material respects in relation to financial reporting risks. Further information on Directors' responsibilities is included on page 250.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in US Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Management, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures in relation to US Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that the Group's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting. These controls, designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer, provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Group's financial reporting and the preparation and presentation of financial statements for external reporting purposes, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as defined on page 148.\n\nThe Group's internal controls over financial reporting include policies and procedures designed to ensure the maintenance of records that:\n\n- - Accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets.\n- - Provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary, enabling the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS, and that receipts and expenditures are made with the authorisation of management and Directors of each of the companies.\n- - Provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Group's assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\n\nDue to inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance. Similarly, these controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements, whether caused by error or fraud, within each of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nThere were no changes to internal controls over financial reporting during the relevant period that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nManagement's evaluation of the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting was based on criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Following this evaluation, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Directors' declaration\n\nThe Directors' statement of responsibilities in relation to the Group's financial statements is set out on page 250.\n\n## Non-audit services and auditor independence\n\nDetails of the non-audit services and a statement of independence regarding the provision of non-audit services undertaken by our external auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, are set out on pages 106-107 of the Directors' report.\n\nA copy of the Auditor's Independence Declaration as required under section 307C of the Corporations Act 2001 is set out on page 269.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors, having made appropriate enquiries, have satisfied themselves that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Additionally, the Directors have considered longer-term viability, as described in their statement on page 78.\n\n## 2023 AGMs\n\nThe 2023 AGMs will be held on 6 April in London, UK and 4 May in Perth, Australia. Separate notices of the 2023 AGMs will be produced for the shareholders of each company.\n\n## Directors' approval statement\n\nThe Directors' report is delivered in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dominic Barton\n\nChair\n\n22 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Compliance with governance codes and standards\n\n## Application of and compliance with governance codes and standards\n\nThis section sets out our compliance with the applicable governance codes and standards. As our shares are listed on both the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and the London Stock Exchange (LSE), we set out how we have complied with the codes and standards of those bodies on the following pages:\n\nLondon Stock Exchange - UK Corporate Governance Code (2018 version) (the UK Code), see pages 142-144.\n\nAustralian Securities Exchange ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4 th edition) (the ASX Principles), see pages 144-146.\n\nIn addition, as explained below, as a foreign private issuer (FPI) with American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), we need to report any significant corporate governance differences from the NYSE listing standards (NYSE Standards) followed by US companies.\n\n## Statement of compliance with the UK Code and ASX Principles\n\nThroughout 2022 and as at the date of this report, the Group has applied the Principles of the UK Code and the ASX Principles. The UK Code is available at www.frc.org.uk, and the ASX Principles at www.asx.com/au. For the purposes of ASX Listing Rule 4.10.3 and the ASX Principles, pages 89-109 of this report form our 'Corporate Governance Statement'. This statement is current as at 22 February 2023, unless otherwise indicated, and has been approved by the Board. Corporate governance documents and policies referenced can be found at riotinto.com/invest/corporate-governance.\n\nWe have complied with all relevant provisions of the UK Code and ASX Principles throughout 2022, with the exception only of the independent third-party evaluation element of Code Provision 21. As set out in the Chair's introduction on page 89, having undertaken a comprehensive strategic governance review in 2022, it was decided it would be more beneficial to defer the independent third-party evaluation of the Board so that it could take place once these governance enhancements were fully embedded in 2023.\n\n## Difference from NYSE Standards\n\nWe have reviewed the NYSE Standards and consider that our practices are broadly consistent with them, with the following exceptions where the literal requirements of the NYSE Standards are not met due to differences in corporate governance between the US, UK and Australia:\n\n- - The NYSE Standards state that US companies must have a nominating/ corporate governance committee which, in addition to identifying individuals qualified to become board members, develops and\n\nrecommends to the Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the company. Our Nominations Committee does not develop corporate governance principles for the Board's approval. The Board itself develops such principles.\n\n- - Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, the company is required to have an audit committee that is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of external auditors. While our Audit & Risk Committee makes recommendations to the Board on these matters, and is subject to legal and regulatory requirements on oversight of audit tenders, the ultimate responsibility for the appointment and retention of the external auditors of Rio Tinto rests with the shareholders.\n- - Under US securities law and the NYSE Standards, an audit committee is required to establish procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and audit matters. The whistleblowing programme (myVoice) enables employees to raise any concerns confidentially or anonymously. The Board has responsibility to ensure that the programme is in place and to review the reports arising from its operations.\n\n## The UK Code\n\n## Board leadership and company purpose\n\n## A. Making the Board effective\n\nOur Board provides effective and entrepreneurial leadership. It is collectively responsible for the stewardship and long-term success of the Group. There is a framework of prudent and effective controls that enable risk to be assessed and managed. The Sustainability section on pages 46-75 sets out how we assess our impact on wider society. See page 99 for the key activities undertaken by the Board during the year and the factors that were considered when making decisions.\n\nIn 2022, the Board undertook a governance review of the composition of the Board, as well as a strategic governance review. Further details can be found on page 101.\n\n## B. The company's purpose, values and strategy and alignment with culture\n\nThrough our Code of Conduct - The Way We Work, the Board sets the company's purpose, values, and standards for the Group's employees. Our values are set out on page 16. The Board is committed to acting in accordance with these values, championing and embedding these in the organisation. The Board also seeks to ensure that the culture of the company is aligned with these values and standards.\n\n## C. Company performance and risk management\n\nThe Board leads the development of long-term investment plans for the company. It aims to make good quality decisions at the right time, to achieve the company's objectives, in alignment with our purpose, values and strategy. The role of the Board in establishing and monitoring the internal control environment is set out in the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 104-107. The way in which the company manages risk is set out on pages 7686. For information on the delegation of business to management, please refer to pages 92-93.\n\nThe formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board's decision, available at riotinto.com, covers areas including: setting the Group's purpose and strategic vision; monitoring performance of the delivery of the approved strategy; approving major investments, acquisitions and divestments; the oversight of risk and the setting of the Group's risk appetite; and reviewing the Group's governance framework.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Chair undertakes regular engagement with our major shareholders, in addition to that carried out by the Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer and the investor relations team. The committee Chairs also engage with their relevant stakeholders; details of this engagement are provided in each of the committee reports. We have mapped our key stakeholders and continually work to understand their views, and we take account of our responsibilities to our stakeholders when making business decisions. We explain more about this in our section 172(1) statement, set out on pages 95-98. We also discuss stakeholders in the Strategic report on pages 18-19 and in the Sustainability section.\n\nSimon McKeon is the designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement. An overview of workforce engagement during 2022 is set out on page 95.\n\nAt Rio Tinto plc's AGM on 8 April 2022, Resolution 20 ('Authority to purchase Rio Tinto plc shares') was passed with less than 80% of votes in favour, and Shining Prospect (a subsidiary of the Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco)) voted against. Chinalco has not sold any Rio Tinto plc shares and now has a holding of over 14%, given its non-participation in Rio Tinto's significant share buy-back programmes over the last four years. This places Chinalco close to the 14.99% threshold agreed with the Australian Government at the time of Chinalco's original investment in 2008.\n\n## E. Our workforce policies and practices\n\nGroup workforce policies are approved by the Board. All the policies relating to our workforce take account of the global nature of our company. Our whistleblowing process is overseen by the Board. Every member of the workforce has access to the whistleblower programme (myVoice); details of this programme are on page 74.",

        "page_content": "## Division of responsibilities\n\n## F. The role of the Chair\n\nThe Chair leads the Board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness. He was independent on the date of his appointment and we consider he remains independent for the purposes of the Code. This was also the case for our former Chairman, Simon Thompson, who stepped down on 5 May 2022. The Chair recognises the importance of creating a boardroom culture that encourages openness and debate and ensures constructive relations between executive and Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for: the management of the Board and its committees; Director performance; induction; training and development; succession planning; engagement with external stakeholders; and attendance by the Board at shareholder meetings.\n\nThe Chair is supported by the Senior Independent Directors, the Group Company Secretary and the Chief Executive. In line with the UK Code, the Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto plc is responsible for acting as a sounding board for the Chair and engages with shareholders to develop a balanced understanding of their interests and concerns. For further details, please see our Board Charter on riotinto.com, which sets out the role, responsibilities, structure, compositions and conduct of the Board, as well as the role of the Chair, the Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto plc and the Senior Independent Director, Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## G. Composition of the Board\n\nAs at the date of this report, the Board comprises ten members: seven independent Non-Executive Directors, the Chair, the Chief Executive, and the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nAs detailed in the Nominations Committee report, we engaged Spencer Stuart to support the search for four new Non-Executive Directors, including Kaisa Hietala who will join the Board on 1 March 2023. The Committee is satisfied that Spencer Stuart does not have any connections with the company or individual Directors that may impair their independence.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that it has the appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence, and knowledge of the company to enable its members to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively, and that no individual or group can dominate the Board's decision making. There is a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of our business. The Chief Executive is responsible for the day-to-day management of the business and, under a Group delegation of authority framework, delegates to other members of the Executive Committee.\n\nMegan Clark has agreed to remain a NonExecutive Director for a further year and will stand for re-election at our 2023 AGMs. On 20 November 2024, Megan will have served for over nine years as a Non-Executive Director on the Board. Megan is Chair of the Sustainability Committee and one of the longest serving Directors on our Board, with significant mining industry experience. In this period of Board\n\nrenewal, it is critically important that the Board continues to benefit from Megan's knowledge and experience. The Board is of the view that Megan continues to make a significant and valuable contribution in the boardroom. In accordance with Code Provision 10, the Board has considered Megan's continuing independence and is satisfied that Megan remains independent. Details of the Board renewal can be found in the Nominations Committee report on page 102.\n\n## H. Role of Non-Executive Directors\n\nWe list all of the Non-Executive Directors that we consider to be independent on pages 90-91 of this report. Over 50% of the Board (excluding the Chair) are Non-Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy. They are also responsible for scrutinising management performance and ensuring that financial information, risks and controls, and systems of risk management are robust. In order to enhance Board engagement in Australia, the role of Senior Independent Director Rio Tinto Limited was established in 2021. Simon McKeon was appointed to this position and the terms of this appointment were agreed on by the Board.\n\nEach Director has undertaken to allocate sufficient time to the Group in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively, and this is kept under review by the Nominations Committee. The Directors' other appointments are listed on pages 90-91.\n\n## I. Board processes and role of the Company Secretary\n\nThe governance framework on page 100 explains the governance structure of the Board and sets out the relationship with the Chief Executive. The roles and responsibilities of each committee are explained. The Board insights section provides some examples of the decision-making process of the Board and the steps it takes to function effectively, including how it considers stakeholders in this process.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary is the trusted interlocutor within the Board and its committees, and between senior leadership and the Non-Executive Directors. He is responsible for advising the Board, through the Chair, on all governance matters. He supports the Chair in ensuring that the information provided to the Board is of sufficient quality and appropriate detail in order for the Board to function effectively and efficiently.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## J. Appointments to the Board\n\nThe Nominations Committee ensures a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors. It is also responsible for Board succession planning, regularly assessing the balance of skills, experience, diversity and capacity required to oversee the delivery of Rio Tinto's strategy. This year, the Nominations Committee oversaw the appointment of our new Non-Executive Director, Kaisa Hietala, effective 1 March 2023, and the ongoing search for more Non-Executive Directors. Details of this process are provided in the Nominations Committee report on page 103.\n\nThe Nominations Committee also reviews proposed appointments to the Executive Committee but has ceded responsibility to the full Board for the process and monitoring of Executive Committee succession planning. As a result, the Board has launched a longer-term succession planning process for the Executive Committee, including the roles of the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer. Further details can be found on page 102.\n\nAll Non-Executive Directors are members of the Nominations Committee. The Committee is chaired by the Chair, apart from when the Committee is dealing with the appointment of his or her successor. Only the Chair and Committee members have the right to attend the meetings of the Nominations Committee; attendance by all other individuals is by invitation only. The Nominations Committee report sets out the Board's approach to succession planning and how this supports the development of a diverse pipeline, at all levels. All Directors are subject to annual re-election at the AGMs.\n\nDetails of external search consultancies used for Board appointments can be found in the Nominations Committee report on page 103.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board and its committees\n\nIn our succession planning, we aim to bring a diverse and complementary range of skills, knowledge and experience to the Board, so that we are equipped to navigate the operational, social, regulatory and geopolitical complexity in which our business operates. Achieving the right blend of skills and diversity to support effective decision making is a continuing process. Further details of tenure and experience of the Board are set out in the Nominations Committee report on page 103. The Board biographies set out the specific skills and experience that each Director brings to the Board (pages 90-91).\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nThe performance of the Board, its committees and individual Directors is evaluated annually. In accordance with Code Provision 21, every third year, an external adviser is engaged to carry out a formal independent evaluation of the Board and its committees. An independent evaluation by an external adviser was due to be undertaken in 2022. However, following the appointment of our new Chair in 2022, a comprehensive strategic governance review of the Board and committees was carried out. This review focused on the composition of the Board, the balance of skills and experience and how Directors should best spend their time supporting the new Group strategy in the context of greater uncertainty and potential risk. Given the timing of this review, a decision was made to defer the external Board evaluation to 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information\n\nsee page 101.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control\n\n## M. Internal and external audit\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee monitors the independence and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function and external auditors. The Committee is responsible for reviewing key judgments within the Group's financial statements and narrative reporting, with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the Group's financial reporting. For further detail, please refer to the Audit & Risk Committee report on pages 104-107.\n\nThe appointment of KPMG as external auditor for the 2022 financial year was approved by shareholders at our AGMs in 2022.\n\n## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe Board is responsible for the presentation of a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects, not only in the Annual Report . We have a robust process in place, including through the Disclosure Committee, to ensure that this is the case.\n\n## O. Risk management and internal control framework\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for aligning our long-term strategic objectives with the risk appetite of the company, taking into account the principal and emerging risks faced by the company. Please refer to pages 76-86 for further details of our business planning cycle and risk management framework and how these support our longer-term viability statement. For further details of our approach to risk, please refer to the Risk section on page 77.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n## P. Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee supports the Board by setting our Remuneration Policy. Through long-term and short-term incentives, our Remuneration Policy is designed to help drive a performance culture that incentivises executives to deliver the Group's long-term strategy and create superior shareholder value over the short, medium and long term. The overarching aim is to ensure our remuneration structure and policies reward fairly and responsibly with a clear link to corporate and individual performance, and to the company's long-term strategy and values. We have worked to ensure that we have a clear policy that can be understood by shareholders and stakeholders.\n\n## Q. Procedure for developing remuneration policy\n\nWe have a formal and transparent procedure for developing our Remuneration Policy, and no Director is involved in deciding their own remuneration. Executive remuneration is set with regard to the wider workforce and through market benchmarking. For further detail, please refer to the People & Remuneration Committee report on pages 110-135. The Committee is supported by remuneration consultant Deloitte. The Board received assurance from the Committee and from Deloitte that Deloitte did not have any connections with Rio Tinto or the Board that would have impaired its independence. Please refer to page 119 of this Annual Report for further detail.\n\n## R. Exercising independent judgment\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee comprises six Non-Executive Directors to ensure independent judgment with regard to remuneration outcomes. The Committee considers remuneration on an annual basis and determines outcomes by assessing executive performance against performance criteria, details of which can be found in the People & Remuneration Committee report on pages 110135 of this Annual Report . This states how our Remuneration Policy has been applied and sets out details of any adjustments made or discretions exercised.\n\n## ASX Principles\n\n## Principle 1: Lay solid foundations for management and oversight\n\n## Recommendation 1.1\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have a common Board of Directors. The principal role of the Board is to set the Group's strategy and to review its strategic direction regularly. The Board also has responsibility for corporate governance. A Board Charter setting out the role of the Board and management and matters reserved for the Board is available at riotinto.com.\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of the business to the Chief Executive and other members of the Executive Committee. A number of management committees support the Chief Executive and the Executive Committee. The structure of these committees is set out on page 100.\n\n## Recommendation 1.2\n\nThe Nominations Committee, on behalf of the Board, ensures a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors. A similar process is followed with the Executive Committee and senior executive appointments, including a formal and rigorous process to source strong candidates from diverse backgrounds and conducting appropriate background and reference checks on the shortlisted candidates. This year, the Nominations Committee oversaw the appointment of our new Non-Executive Director, Kaisa Hietala effective 1 March 2023, and the ongoing search for three more Non-Executive Directors. Details of this process are provided in the Nominations Committee report on page 103.\n\nThe notice of AGM provides all material information in Rio Tinto's possession relevant to decisions on election and re-election of Directors, including a statement from the Board that it considers all Directors continue to perform effectively and demonstrate appropriate levels of commitment. It also provides reasons why each Director is recommended for re-election, highlighting their relevant skills and experience. Further information on the skills and experience of each Director is set out on pages 90-91 of the Annual Report .\n\n## Recommendation 1.3\n\nThe company has written agreements setting out the terms of appointment for each Director and senior executive. Non-Executive Directors are appointed by letters of appointment. Executive Directors and other senior executives are employed through employment service contracts. Further information is set out on pages 128-129 in the Remuneration report.\n\n## Recommendation 1.4\n\nThe Group Company Secretary is accountable to the Board and advises the Chair, and, through the Chair, the Board on all governance matters. The appointment and removal of the Group Company Secretary is a matter reserved for the Board.\n\n## Recommendation 1.5\n\nRio Tinto has a Group-wide, Board-endorsed Inclusion and Diversity Policy. The policy is available at riotinto.com. The Board sets objectives for achieving diversity for the Board, senior executives and the workforce, and annually reviews the Group's performance against them. Page 51 of the Annual Report sets out the measurable objectives and our performance against them. The respective proportions of men and women on the Board, in senior executive positions and across the whole organisation, are reported on pages 51 and 103 of the Annual Report.",

Our Code of Conduct is available at riotinto.com/ethics.\n\nRio Tinto's confidential and independently operated whistleblowing programme (myVoice) offers an avenue through which our employees, contractors, suppliers and customers can report concerns anonymously, subject to local law. These may include concerns about the business, or behaviour of individuals, including suspicion of violations of financial reporting, safety or environmental procedures or other business integrity issues.

A copy of the Group Disclosure and Communications Policy is available at riotinto.com.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee is responsible for determining whether information relating to Rio Tinto may require disclosure to the markets under the continuous disclosure requirements in the jurisdictions in which Rio Tinto is listed.

        "page_content": "## Corporate information\n\n## About Rio Tinto\n\nIn 1995, Rio Tinto plc, incorporated in the UK and listed on the London and New York Stock Exchanges, and Rio Tinto Limited, incorporated in Australia and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, formed a dual listed companies structure ('DLC'). Under the DLC, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited are viewed as a single economic enterprise, with common boards of directors, and the shareholders of both companies have a common economic interest in the DLC. For further information on the DLC structure see page 338 in the additional information section of the annual report. IFRS-compliant consolidated financial statements of the Rio Tinto Group are prepared on this basis, with interests of shareholders of both companies presented as the equity interests of shareholders in the Rio Tinto Group. This is in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards and in accordance with an order, under section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001, issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) on 16 July 2021 ('ASIC order').\n\nFor further details of the ASIC Class Order relief see page 249.\n\nRio Tinto's business is finding, mining, and processing mineral resources. Major products are iron ore, aluminium, copper, industrial minerals (borates, titanium dioxide and salt) and diamonds. Activities span the world and are strongly represented in Australia and North America, with significant businesses in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America.\n\nRio Tinto plc's registered office is at 6 St James's Square, London SW1Y 4AD, UK. Rio Tinto Limited's registered office is at Level 43, 120 Collins Street, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia.\n\n## About the presentation of our financial statements\n\nIn the current year we have reviewed our notes to the financial statements taking into account materiality (as described below). We have also re-organised the notes into logical groupings to help users find and understand relevant information. Where possible, related information, such as accounting policies, has been provided in the same section as the relevant note.\n\nAll financial statement values are presented in US dollars and rounded to the nearest million (US$m) unless otherwise stated. Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to measure or present them on the same basis as current period figures.\n\nOur financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 were authorised for issue in accordance with a directors' resolution on 22 February 2023.\n\n## a. The basis of preparation\n\nThe financial information included in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, and for the related comparative periods, has been prepared:\n\n- -under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments, the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the hedged items and the accounting for postemployment assets and obligations;\n- -on a going concern basis - Management has prepared detailed cash flow forecasts for at least 12 months and has updated life-ofmine plan models with longer-term cash flow projections which demonstrate that we will have sufficient cash, other liquid resources and undrawn credit facilities to enable us to meet our obligations as they fall due;\n- -to meet UK-adopted international accounting standards, applicable UK law (Companies Act 2006) and Australian law (Australian Corporations Act 2001) as amended by the ASIC class order;\n- -to meet international accounting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and interpretations issued from time to time by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) which are mandatory at 31 December 2022.\n\n148\n\nThe above accounting standards and interpretations are collectively referred to as 'IFRS' in this report and contain the principles we use to create our accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the locally reported assets, liabilities, and results of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies in line with ours for consistent reporting.\n\n## b. The basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements consolidate the accounts of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited (together 'the Companies') and their respective subsidiaries (together 'the Group', 'we', 'our') and include the Group's share of joint arrangements and associates.\n\nWe consolidate subsidiaries where  either of the companies controls the entity. Control exists where either of the companies has: power over the entities, that is, existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entities (those that significantly affect the companies' returns); exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entities; and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. A list of principal subsidiaries is shown in note 30.\n\nA joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that decisions about the relevant activities of the arrangement (those that significantly affect the companies' returns) require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. We have two types of joint arrangements - joint operations (JOs) and joint ventures (JVs). A JO is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. For our JOs, shown in note 31, we recognise: our share of assets and liabilities; revenue from the sale of our share of the output and our share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the JO; and its share of expenses. All such amounts are measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to our interest in the JO. These amounts are recorded in our financial statements on the appropriate lines. A JV is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. JVs are accounted for using the equity accounting method.\n\nAn associate is an entity over which we have significant influence. Significant influence is presumed to exist where there is neither control nor joint control and the Group has over 20% of the voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case. Significant influence can arise where we hold less than 20% of the voting rights if we have the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions affecting the entity. It also includes situations of collective control.\n\nWe use the term 'equity accounted units' (EAUs) to refer to associates and JVs collectively. Under the equity accounting method, the investment is recorded initially at cost to the Group, including any goodwill on acquisition. In subsequent periods the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to reflect the Group's share of the EAUs' retained post-acquisition profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Our principal JVs and associates are shown in note 32.\n\nIn some cases, we participate in unincorporated arrangements and have rights to our share of the assets and obligations for our share of the liabilities of the arrangement rather than a right to a net return, but do not share joint control. In such cases, we account for these arrangements in the same way as our joint operations with all such amounts measured in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to our interest in the arrangement.\n\nAll intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.",

Materiality\n\nOur directors consider information to be material if correcting a misstatement, omission or obscuring could, in the light of surrounding circumstances, reasonably be expected to change the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the financial statements. The Group considers both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether information is material; the concept of materiality is therefore not driven purely by numerical values.\n\nWhen considering the potential materiality of information, management makes an initial quantitative assessment using thresholds based on estimates of profit before taxation; for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 the quantitative threshold was US$700 million. However, other considerations can result in a determination that lower values are material or, occasionally, that higher values are immaterial. These considerations include whether a misstatement, omission or obscuring: masks a change or trend in key performance indicators; causes reported key metrics to change from a positive to a negative values or vice-versa; affects compliance with regulatory requirements or other contractual requirements; could result in an increase to management's compensation; or might conceal an unlawful transaction.\n\n## d. Summary of key judgments or other relevant judgments made in applying the accounting policies\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to use judgment in applying accounting policies and in making critical accounting estimates.\n\nThese judgments and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements. Areas of judgment in the application of accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are noted below and further information is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the financial statements.\n\nSummarised below are the key judgments which we have taken in the application of the Group's accounting policies for 2022 and how they compare to the prior year. Taking a different judgment over these matters would lead to a material impact on the 2022 financial statements. More detail on the judgment can be found in the respective notes.\n\nIn assessing materiality, management also applies judgment based on its understanding of the business and its internal and external financial statement users. The assessment will consider user expectations of numerical and narrative reporting. Sources used in making this assessment would include, for example: published analyst consensus measures, experience gained in formal and informal dialogue with users (including regulatory correspondence), and peer group benchmarking.\n\n| Key judgments                                                    | 2022   |    | 2021 Reason for change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Indicators of impairment and impairment reversals  (note 4)      | a      | a  | No change to the judgment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Uncertain tax positions (note 10)                                | 0      | a  | The settlement in 2022 with the Australian Taxation Office  (ATO) has reduced the balance over which judgment is  exercised.

Currency\n\n## Other relevant judgments - Identification of functional currency\n\nWe present our financial statements in US dollars, as that presentation currency most reliably reflects the global business performance of the Group as a whole.\n\nThe functional currency for each subsidiary, unincorporated arrangement, joint operation and equity accounted unit is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. For businesses that reside in developed economies the functional currency is generally the currency of the country in which it operates because of the dominance of locally incurred costs. If the business resides in an emerging economy, the US dollar is generally identified to be the functional currency as a higher proportion of costs, particularly imported goods and services, are agreed and paid in US dollars, in common with other international investors. Determination of functional currency involves judgment, and other companies may make different judgments based on similar facts.\n\nThe determination of functional currency affects the measurement of non-current assets included in the balance sheet and, as a consequence, the depreciation and amortisation of those assets included in the income statement. It also impacts exchange gains and losses included in the income statement and in equity. We also apply judgment in determining whether settlement of certain intragroup loans is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future and therefore whether the associated exchange gains and losses can be taken to equity. During 2022, A$15 billion of intragroup loans continued to meet these criteria; associated exchange gains and losses are taken to equity.\n\nOn consolidation, income statement items for each entity are translated from the functional currency into US dollars at the full-year average rate of exchange, except for material one-off transactions, which are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period-end exchange rates.\n\nExchange differences arising on the translation of the net assets of entities with functional currencies other than the US dollar are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. These translation differences are shown in the statement of comprehensive income, with the exception of the translation adjustment relating to Rio Tinto Limited's share capital, which is shown in the statement of changes in equity.\n\nWhere an intragroup balance is, in substance, part of the Group's net investment in an entity, exchange gains and losses on that balance are taken to the currency translation reserve.\n\nExcept as noted above, or where exchange differences are deferred as part of a cash flow hedge, all other differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.\n\nThe principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:\n\n|                                                                    |   Full-year average |   Full-year average |   Full-year average |   Year-end |   Year-end |   Year-end |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| One unit of local currency buys the following number of US dollars |            2022     |            2021     |            2020     |   2022     |   2021     |   2020     |\n| Pound sterling                                                     |               1.24  |               1.38  |               1.28  |      1.21  |      1.35  |      1.36  |\n| Australian dollar                                                  |               0.69  |               0.75  |               0.69  |      0.68  |      0.73  |      0.77  |\n| Canadian dollar                                                    |               0.77  |               0.8   |               0.75  |      0.74  |      0.78  |      0.78  |\n| Euro                                                               |               1.05  |               1.18  |               1.14  |      1.07  |      1.13  |      1.23  |\n| South African rand                                                 |               0.061 |               0.068 |               0.061 |      0.059 |      0.063 |      0.068 |\n\n151",

Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources\n\nA Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality), and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated Mineral Resource.\n\nThe estimation of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources requires judgment to interpret available geological data and subsequently to select an appropriate mining method and then to establish an extraction schedule. At least annually, the Competent Persons of the Group (according to the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the JORC Code)), estimate Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources using assumptions such as:\n\n- -Available geological data;\n- -Expected future commodity price and demand;\n- -Exchange rates;\n- -Production costs;\n- -Transport costs;\n- -Close-down and restoration costs;\n- -Recovery rates;\n- -Discount rates; and\n- -Renewal of mining licences.\n\nWith regard to our future commodity price assumptions, to calculate our Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources for our filing on the Australian Securities Exchange and London Stock Exchange, we use prices generated by our Strategy and Economics team (refer to the Climate change section for further details about our pricing methodology). For our Annual Report on Form 20-F, filed with the Securities Exchange Commission ('SEC'), we use consensus price or historical pricing and comply with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (Regulation S-K), instead of with the JORC code.\n\nWe use judgment as to when to include Mineral Resources in accounting estimates, for example, the use of Mineral Resources in our depreciation policy as described in note 13 and in the determination of the date of closure as described in note 14.\n\nThere are many uncertainties in the estimation process and assumptions that are valid at the time of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. New geological or economic data, or unforeseen operational issues may change estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources. This could cause material adjustments in our financial statements to:\n\n- -Depreciation and amortisation rates;\n- -Carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment;\n- -Deferred stripping costs;\n- -Provisions for close-down and restoration costs; and\n- -Recovery of deferred tax assets.\n\nThe unaudited statement of ore reserves is included on page 284 and of mineral resources on page 296.\n\n## h. Impact of climate change on the Group Strategy and approach to climate change\n\nOver a year ago, we put the low-carbon transition at the heart of our new strategy, setting a clear pathway to deliver long-term value as well as ambitious targets to decarbonise our business. In 2022, our shareholders supported our Climate Action Plan in a non-binding advisory vote on the Group's ambitions, emissions targets and actions to achieve them. Further detail of our approach is provided in the front half of our Annual Report and in our 2022 Climate Change Report.\n\nOur Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets of 15% by 2025, 50% by 2030 (both relative to our 2018 equity baseline) and the aim to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 are aligned with 1.5\u00b0C - the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. We have set up six large abatement programmes focused on renewables, Pacific aluminium operations, ELYSIS TM technology, process heat, minerals processing and diesel alternatives.\n\n152\n\nTo deliver our climate targets, we expect to make capital investment of US$7.5 billion in decarbonisation projects over the period to 2030, including around US$1.5 billion in the next three years, mainly relating to the repowering of the Pilbara. Progress towards our Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets is reflected within executive remuneration.\n\nIn 2022, we delivered the first 34MW of renewable power at Gudai-Darri and announced our plan to invest US$600 million in 200MWh of solar power facilities and 200MWh of battery storage in the Pilbara by 2026. We agreed to test at least four battery-powered locomotives, and pilot battery-powered trucks in the Pilbara in 2024. By 2030, we aim to phase out the purchase of diesel haulage trucks and locomotives across our operations. At the Queensland Alumina refinery we are working to develop an energy efficient digestion process at an estimated cost of US$240 million. In 2022, we continued to work with the Queensland Government and energy providers to design a renewable energy solution for Boyne Smelter. Similarly, in 2022, Tomago Aluminium Company released an expression of interest to work towards a green repowering solution for the Tomago smelter. In addition, we have signed a 130MW solar power purchase agreement for Richards Bay Minerals (RBM) in South Africa. We also intend to decarbonise our shipping fleet and aim to have net zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030. To achieve this, in 2022 we successfully completed a trial of fuel blend with biofuels and in 2023-2024 we plan to incorporate nine LNG dual-fuel chartered vessels into our fleet. Decarbonisation projects are expected to accelerate beyond 2025, which we expect to include further decarbonisation of the Pilbara electricity system (estimated at US$3 billion out of the US$7.5 billion total spend by 2030) and other abatement projects.\n\nWe are also stepping up our focus on Scope 3 goals, which are explicitly linked to executive remuneration. Over 90% of our Scope 3 emissions are from the downstream processing of iron ore, bauxite and other products by our customers. We have not set an overall quantitative Scope 3 emissions target, but instead engage with our customers to optimise their current operations toward low-emitting, higher efficiency processes; and foster partnerships with them, which we believe are more effective ways to advance actions. The shift toward green steel is underway and we are working on options to beneficiate our Pilbara ores to be better suited to green steel technologies and are exploring DRI pathways using sustainable resources such as hydrogen and biomass.\n\nWe expect that our annual incremental operating expenditure on building new teams and energy efficiency initiatives will be around US$200 million, in addition to R&D investment.\n\nOur ambition is to increase our growth capital expenditure to around US$2 billion in 2023 and up to US$3 billion per year in 2024-2025 to capture new growth opportunities with a focus on materials that are expected to see strong demand growth from the low carbon transition. This includes investment in future production of lithium at Rincon, copper at Oyu Tolgoi and Winu and high-grade iron ore from Simandou. Our budget for central greenfield exploration remains at approximately US$250 million annually, mainly focused on copper with a growing battery minerals programme.\n\nFor internal capital allocation purposes for major projects, a notional carbon price of US$75/t CO 2 e is used to incentivise investment in low carbon abatement options. The US$75/t CO 2 e price is derived from our analysis of the carbon mitigation options across our assets that are needed to achieve our emissions targets. This is unrelated to the different carbon prices we use in our core scenarios which are based on our assessment of climate policy ambition.\n\nThe impact of climate change and the execution of our climate change strategy on our financial statements is discussed below:\n\n## Climate change scenarios\n\nOur strategy and approach to climate change are informed by an analysis of the interplay of global megatrends, explored through the lens of plausible global scenarios. These set the context for our industry and underpin our commodity price outlooks, portfolio and capital allocation choices and how we operate as a business.  There are many plausible scenarios for global energy transition, all with different impacts on future",

        "page_content": "commodity price outcomes. As part of our 2022 strategy process, we replaced our three scenarios described in the 2021 Annual Report and now focus on two core scenarios. These are used to generate a single central Reference Case for use in commodity pricing forecasts, valuation models and reserves and resources determination, as was the case in the prior year. These changes in scenarios represent an evolution of our interpretation and estimations in the current year, not a change in accounting policy, and as such we have not restated comparative information. Our two core scenarios are:\n\n- -Competitive Leadership scenario, limiting global warming to approximately 2\u00b0C by 2100, reflects a rapidly developing world of high growth and strong climate action post-2030 with change driven by policy and competitive innovation. As a result, we expect that countries achieve their Glasgow Climate Pact commitments. Global weighted average carbon prices are forecast to rise rapidly at an average of 8% per year over the next three decades, reaching US$42/tCO 2 e in 2030, and rising rapidly post-2030 to incentivise significant mitigation in industrial sectors post-2030.\n- -Fragmented Leadership scenario, with global warming exceeding 2.5\u00b0C by 2100, is characterised by limited progress on policy reform with volatile low growth. We expect that nations eventually achieve their 2030 Nationally Determined Contributions as agreed in Paris in 2015 but fail to progress towards long term carbon goals agreed at the UN Climate Summit COP26 Glasgow. Global weighted average carbon prices are forecast to rise slowly, at an average of 2.9% per year over the period to 2050, reaching US$42 in 2030; but remain too low post-2030 to incentivise significant mitigation in industrial sectors resulting in flat global emissions post-2030.\n\nAt the UN Climate Summit in late 2022 (COP27), there was broad recognition that the pace of decarbonisation across the global economy is too slow to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C and that current climate policies in many countries are not yet aligned with their stated ambitions. Consequently, neither of our two core scenarios is consistent with the expectation of climate policies required to accelerate the global transition to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. Although our operational emissions reduction targets align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, our two core scenarios do not. Consequently, we also assess our sensitivity and test the economic performance of our business against a scenario we have developed to reflect our view of the global actions required to meet the stretch goal of the Paris Agreement. We refer to this Paris-aligned scenario as the Aspirational Leadership scenario.\n\nImportantly none of our three scenarios are considered a definitive representation for our assessment of the future impact of climate change on the Group. Scenario modelling has inherent limitations and by its nature allows a range of possible outcomes to be considered where it is impossible to predict which outcome is likely.\n\nThe Aspirational Leadership scenario reflects a world of high growth, significant social change and accelerated climate action. Global weighted average carbon prices rise rapidly - at an average of 9.3% per year over the next three decades - reaching $59/tCO2e in 2030 and incentivise rapid and deep reductions in industrial emissions post-2030. Despite geopolitical differences, major economies work together through multilateral frameworks and proactively work towards limiting temperature change to 1.5\u00b0C by 2050. The Aspirational Leadership scenario is a commodity sales price and carbon tax sensitivity, with all other inputs remaining equal to our Reference Case; and is built by design to reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050 and help us better understand the pathways to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and what this could mean for our business. It is used for strategy and risk discussions, including analysis of sensitivity to our view of a Parisaligned pathway and comparison of relative economic performance to our core scenarios.\n\nWe do not publish the commodity price forecasts  associated with these scenarios as to do so would weaken our position in commercial negotiations and might give rise to concerns from other market participants.\n\n## Impacts of climate change pricing scenarios on our portfolio, low-carbon transition risks and opportunities\n\nThrough our strategy process we compare the economic performance of our portfolio under our two core scenarios and the Aspirational Leadership scenario and this indicates that overall the economic performance of our portfolio would be stronger in scenarios with proactive climate action, particularly in relation to aluminium, copper and higher-grade iron ore.\n\nWe anticipate that all our commodities are needed in the low-carbon transition, but estimate that the demand varies significantly between our scenarios. We expect that copper demand will rise from a 2020 base  by 65-150% by 2050 across the three scenarios to support a rapid rise in renewable generation while lithium is expected to be a fundamental ingredient in electric vehicle batteries and grid-firming energy storage solutions. Demand for aluminium is expected to grow for use in energyefficient lightweight vehicles with demand for aluminium semifabricated products more than doubling in the period 2021-50 in Aspirational Leadership and Competitive Leadership scenarios, with moderate demand growth in Fragmented Leadership. Our access to self-generated hydro power is a source of competitive advantage for our aluminium business in Canada.\n\nWe forecast that global iron ore demand will remain strong with a premium on higher grade ore needed for the production of green steel, such as that from our IOC products and the planned investment in Simandou, which increases in our Aspirational Leadership and Competitive Leadership scenarios. In our Aspirational Leadership scenario, accelerated switching to green steel and increasing scrap use reduces the relative value of low-grade iron ore in the Pilbara.\n\nWe will need to carefully monitor and manage transition risks linked to our operational Scope 1 and 2 emissions and value-chain Scope 3 emissions.  In particular, we expect the decarbonisation of our assets to benefit from the implementation of new technologies. The pace of technological development is uncertain, which could delay or increase the cost of our decarbonisation efforts.\n\nOur Aspirational Leadership scenario predicts the Group's overall economic performance would fall between the Fragmented Leadership and Competitive Leadership scenarios. This reflects higher estimated economic performance for our copper and aluminium businesses in the Aspirational Leadership scenario, based on their higher price profiles, offset by higher expected carbon penalties across our operating jurisdictions, and lower prices for lower grade iron ore products. Refer below for our assessment of the accounting implications of forecast commodity pricing in the Aspirational Leadership scenario.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nIn 2022, we launched the Physical Resilience Programme across the Group. During the year we commenced a physical risk and resilience assessment across prioritised risk areas: the entire Pilbara iron ore operation and the Saguenay aluminium operations focused on Lac Saint-Jean. Our ongoing review processes, including impairment assessments, have not identified any material accounting impacts to date. For example, in 2022, no write-offs are necessary in the Pilbara, where certain infrastructure assets, such as transmission lines, that have reached the end of their natural lives are being replaced with climate resilient infrastructure. In addition, we do not foresee the renewal of our contractual water rights in Canada that have been classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets to be at risk from climate change (note 12). Further, closure planning considers future climate change projections at each step of the process to support safe and appropriate final landform design. In 2023, we will progress a Group-wide top-down assessment to further understand the risks and opportunities associated with physical climate change and to quantify any financial impacts, in addition to the site-specific bottom-up assessments, which will continue in the foreseeable future.\n\n153",

        "page_content": "## Accounting judgments and estimates\n\nGlobal decarbonisation and the world's energy transition continues to evolve, with the potential to materially impact our future financial results as our significant accounting judgments and key estimates  are updated to reflect prevailing circumstances.  In response, carrying values of assets and liabilities could be materially affected in future periods. Our current strategy and approach to decarbonise our operations and achieve our scope 1 and 2 emissions targets is considered in our significant judgments and key estimates reflected in these financial results.\n\n## Impacts from executing our climate change strategy - accounting for capital expenditure and operating costs underpinning our Climate Action Plan\n\nGiven the significant investment we are making to abate our carbon emissions, we have considered the potential for asset obsolescence, with a particular focus on our Pilbara operations where we are prioritising investment in renewables to switch away from natural gas power generation. No material changes to accounting estimates to useful economic lives have been necessary due to the anticipated use of these assets for firming support in the transition (note 13). As the renewable projects progress, it is possible that such adjustments may be identified in the future. The renewable assets in the Pilbara are our own built and operated arrangements and follow normal rules on capitalisation of directly attributable costs. The solar power purchase agreement for RBM is accounted for on an accrual basis as energy is produced.\n\nThere are no accounting impacts to date from the programme to develop renewable energy solutions for our Queensland aluminium assets as the work has not been completed and commercial terms have not been agreed. Large scale renewable power off-take arrangements may, in the future, require complex derivative measurement or lease accounting depending on contractual terms.\n\nNo adjustments to useful lives of the existing fleet have been identified to date as a result of planned fleet electrification in the Pilbara and the purchase of battery-powered locomotives. The solutions are still in development or pilot stages and the gradual fleet replacement is intended to be part of the normal lifecycle renewal of trucks. Depending on technological development,  which is highly uncertain, this could lead to accelerated depreciation in the future. Similarly, our target to have net zero vessels in our portfolio by 2030 has not given rise to accounting adjustments to date, as the replacement is planned as part of the lifecycle renewal. The energy efficiency digestion project at Queensland Alumina refinery does not reduce the economic lives of the underlying alumina assets but could lower operating costs and improve margins. The expenditure on our own carbon abatement projects and technology advancements follows existing accounting policies on cost capitalisation, research and development costs.\n\n## Use of sensitivities to Paris aligned accounting\n\nThe forecast commodity prices (including carbon prices) informed by a blend of our two scenarios are used pervasively in our financial processes from budgeting, forecasting, capital allocation and project evaluation to the determination of ore reserves. In turn, these prices are used to derive critical accounting estimates included as inputs to impairment testing, estimation of remaining economic life for units of production depreciation and discounting closure and rehabilitation provisions.  These prices represent our best estimate of actual market outcomes based on the range of future economic conditions regarding matters largely outside our control, as required by IFRS. As neither of our core scenarios represents the Group's view of the goals of the Paris Agreement, our commodity price assumptions used in accounting estimates are not consistent with the expectation of climate policies\n\n154\n\nrequired to accelerate the global transition to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. As described above, we use our Aspirational Leadership scenario to understand the sensitivity of these estimates to Paris aligned assumptions.\n\nUnder the Aspirational Leadership scenario, which is not used in the preparation of these financial statements, nor for budgeting purposes, the economic performance of copper and aluminium is expected to be stronger under supply and demand forward pricing curves which we believe will be consistent with the Paris Agreement. It is possible therefore, under the right conditions, that historical impairments associated with these assets could reverse. We recognised an impairment of US$202 million during the year for the Boyne smelter cash-generating unit, triggered by economic and operating performance of the smelter (note 4). When measuring the recoverable amount for this cash-generating unit we utilised net present value of cash flows to the end of the existing joint venture agreements in 2029, which also coincides with the Group's targeted carbon emission reductions by 2030. The Group continues to evaluate lower emission power solutions for the smelter that could extend its life to at least 2040. In such circumstances, the net present value of forecast future cash flows could support the reversal of past impairments. Both the recorded outcome and the sensitivity represent a reduction in emissions that we considered to be Paris-aligned.\n\nIn the Aspirational Leadership scenario the prices for lower-grade iron ore are supported in the medium term by an assumed underlying increase in GDP-driven demand. However, in the longer term we assume the pricing for lower grade iron ore to be weaker than in our core scenarios. This will depend on the development of low-emissions steel technology, the pace of which is uncertain, but is expected to be offset by higher prices for higher-grade iron ore. This is unlikely to give rise to impairment triggers for 2022 or in the foreseeable future due to the high returns on capital employed in the Pilbara.\n\nWe completed the divestments of our coal businesses in 2018 and no longer mine coal, but retained a contingent royalty from these divestments. Recent favourable coal prices exceeded contractual benchmark levels and resulted in the cash royalty receipt of US$36 million during 2022. We also carry royalty receivables of US$209 million on our balance sheet at 31 December 2022, measured at fair value (note 24). The fair value of this balance may be adversely impacted in the future by a faster pace of transition to a low carbon economy, but this impact is not expected to be material.\n\nClosure dates and cost of closure are also sensitive to climate assumptions, but no material changes have been identified in the year specific to climate change that would require a material revision to the provisions in 2022. For those commodities with higher forward price curves under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, it may be economical to mine lower mineral grades, which could result in the conversion of additional Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves and therefore longer dated closure.\n\nOverall, based on the Aspirational Leadership scenario pricing outcomes, and with all other assumptions remaining consistent with those applied to our 2022 financial statements, we do not currently envisage a material adverse impact of the 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned sensitivity on asset carrying values, remaining useful life, or closure and rehabilitation provisions for the Group. It is possible that other factors may arise in the future, which are not known today, that may impact this assessment.\n\nAdditional commentary on the impact of climate change on our business is included in the following notes:",

New standards issued and effective in the current year\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies consistent with those applied in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, except for the accounting requirements set out below, effective as at 1 January 2022. These did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment')\n\nWe adopted Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment') at 1 January 2022. The amendment prohibits the deduction, from the cost of major project construction work in progress, of proceeds (net of additional processing costs) from selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for use. Under the amendment, proceeds from selling items before the related item of property, plant and equipment is available for use are recognised within 'Consolidated sales revenue' in the income statement along with the costs of producing those items within 'Net operating costs (excluding items disclosed separately)'. We apportion development expenditure in the period to derive the cost associated with pre-production revenue, based on the tonnes produced in the period as a percentage of the total expected production (estimated total ore reserve). During 2021 we completed a review of the impact of these amendments and concluded that adjustments to retained earnings as at 1 January 2020, and restatement of the 2020 and 2021 Group Income Statement and Balance Sheet upon adoption of the amendments, were insignificant and as a result no restatements were made to comparative periods. During the year ended 31 December 2022 we recognised in the income statement pre-production revenue of  US$511 million and related costs of US$30 million in relation to Gudai Darri and Oyu Tolgoi.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets')\n\nWe adopted Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets') at 1 January 2022. The amendments specify that the costs an entity includes in determining whether a contract is onerous are made up of all directly related costs, including both incremental amounts and an allocation of other directly related expenditure. Previously, we made provision for onerous contracts when the assets dedicated to the contract were fully impaired or the contract became stranded as a result of a business decision. From 2022, we record a provision if a contract is found to be loss-making on a stand-alone basis following allocation of all directly related costs as required by the amendments to IAS 37.\n\nWe have applied the amendments without revision to comparative amounts. We have increased other provisions and reduced our retained earnings as at 1 January 2022 by US$17 million.\n\n## j. Reconciliation with Australian Accounting Standards\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, as defined in the 'Basis of preparation' on page 148, which differs in certain respects from the version of International Financial Reporting Standards that is applicable in Australia, referred to as Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). We are required to disclose the effect of the adjustments to our consolidated income statement, consolidated total comprehensive income/(loss) and consolidated shareholders' funds if our accounts were prepared under the version of IFRS that is applicable in Australia. This is in order to satisfy the obligations of Rio Tinto Limited to prepare consolidated accounts under Australian company law, as amended by an order issued by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 16 July 2021.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, our financial statements were prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. Under IFRS, goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1998, which was eliminated directly against equity in the Group's UK GAAP financial statements, has not been reinstated. This was permitted under the rules governing the transition to IFRS set out in IFRS 1. The equivalent Australian Standard, AASB 1, does not provide for the netting of goodwill against equity. As a consequence, shareholders' funds under AAS include the residue of such goodwill, which amounted to US$380 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: US$377 million).\n\nSave for the exception described above, the Group's financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS are consistent with the requirements of AAS.\n\nAnnual Report 2022\n\n|  riotinto.com\n\n155",

The Executive Committee members each report directly to our Chief Executive who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. The CODM's primary measure of profit is underlying EBITDA. Finance costs and net debt are managed on a Group-wide basis and are therefore excluded from the segmental results.\n\nOur reportable segments are as follows:\n\n| Reportable segment   | Principal activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Iron Ore             | Iron ore mining and salt and gypsum production in Western Australia.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Aluminium            | Bauxite mining; alumina refining; aluminium smelting.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Copper               | Mining and refining of copper, gold, silver, molybdenum and other by-products; exploration activities together with the Simandou iron  ore project, which was the responsibility of the Copper product group chief executive during 2022.  |\n| Minerals             | Includes businesses with products such as borates, titanium dioxide feedstock together with the Iron Ore Company of Canada (iron  ore mining and iron concentrate/pellet production).

Separate cashgenerating units are identified where an active market exists for intermediate products, even if the majority of those products are further processed internally.\n\nIn some cases, individual business units consist of several operations with independent cash-generating streams which constitute separate cashgenerating units.\n\nGoodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to the cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the related business combination, and tested for impairment at the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. All cash-generating units containing goodwill (note 11), indefinite-lived intangible assets and intangible assets that are not ready for use (note 12) are tested annually for impairment as at 30 September, regardless of whether there has been an impairment trigger, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.\n\n## Other relevant judgments - determination of CGUs\n\nJudgment is applied to identify the Group's CGUs, particularly when assets belong to integrated operations, and changes in CGUs could impact impairment charges and reversals. The most significant judgment continues to relate to the continued grouping of Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations, Canada and QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM), Madagascar as a single CGU on the basis that they are vertically integrated operations and there is no active market for ilmenite. During the year we have separated the Gladstone Power Station from the Boyne Smelter cash-generating unit; refer to page 168 for more information.\n\nThe carrying values for undeveloped properties are reviewed at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 6. The indicators of impairment differ from the tests in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets' in recognition of the subjectivity of estimating future cash flows for mineral interests under evaluation. Potential indicators of impairment include: expiry of the right to explore, substantive expenditure is no longer planned, commercially viable quantities of mineral resources have not been discovered and exploration activities will be discontinued, or sufficient data exists to indicate a future development would be unlikely to recover the carrying amount in full. When such impairment indicators have been identified, the recoverable amount and impairment charge are measured under IAS 36. Impairment reversals for undeveloped properties are not subject to special conditions within IFRS 6 and are therefore subject to the same monitoring for indicators of impairment reversal as other cash-generating units.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including right of use assets and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. This review starts with an appraisal of the perimeter of cash-generating units to consider changes in the business or strategic direction. Following this, an assessment of internal and external indicators is performed. Internal sources of information considered includes assessment of the financial performance of the CGU and changes in mine plans. External sources of information, include changes in forecast commodity prices, costs and other market factors.\n\nNon-current assets (excluding goodwill) that have suffered impairment are reviewed using the same basis for valuation as explained above whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the impairment loss may no longer exist, or may have decreased. If appropriate, an impairment reversal will be recognised. The carrying amount of the cash-generating unit after reversal must be the lower of (a) the recoverable amount, as calculated above, and (b) the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the cash-generating unit in prior periods.\n\nIf events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment or impairment reversal, assessments are performed more frequently than just annually.\n\nIn 2022, we identified indicators of impairment at the Boyne Smelter in the aluminium segment and indicators of impairment reversal at the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project.\n\n165",

At the time of their impairment, the carrying value and fair value for these cash-generating units were equal, making the cash-generating units sensitive to changes in economic assumptions, albeit headroom may have subsequently arisen due to inflation and the passage of time.

For external sources of information that could indicate impairment, we considered current and projected commodity prices and noted the transaction with Turquoise Hill minority shareholders. Whilst the value imputed by extrapolating that transaction price is less than the carrying value of the cash-generating unit, we noted this reflected funding and liquidity risks associated with minority shareholdings rather than information relevant to the underlying assets. Accordingly we concluded that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.

The plant was further impaired in 2021 (refer to the section below) as operational performance was adversely impacted by a workforce strike in June 2021 that has reduced the capacity over a prolonged period. The ramp-up of operations continuing into 2022 following the strike was anticipated in the determination of the 2021 recoverable amount.

As highlighted in the climate change section, the economic performance of assets in the aluminium segment has the potential to perform more strongly as the world transitions to a lower carbon future; however, our assessment of external sources of information did not indicate that this had yet been priced into asset valuations. We concluded that there were no indicators of impairment or impairment reversal.

Such non-reserve material is only included when there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. This expectation is usually based on preliminary drilling and sampling of areas of mineralisation that are contiguous with existing ore reserves. Typically, the additional evaluation required to achieve reserves status for such material has not yet been done because this would involve incurring evaluation costs earlier than is required for the efficient planning and operation of the mine. 27,508 18,837 2,941 9,314 2,152 1,009 4,969 2,084 1,659 5,170 1,710 455 46,961 24,783 6,064 321 24 1 (264) (94) (2,407)\n\nAs noted above, cost levels incorporated in the cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on the current life-of-mine plan or longterm production plan for the cash-generating unit. This differs from value in use which requires future cash flows to be estimated for the asset in its current condition and therefore does not include future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset's performance. Anticipated enhancements to assets may be included in FVLCD calculations and, therefore, generally result in a higher value. 117 (133) (545) (250) 45 79 44,611 6,189\n\n23,902\n\nWhere indication of impairment or impairment reversal exists then an impairment review is undertaken; the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use (being the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash-generating unit in its current condition) and fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD). When the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is measured by reference to FVLCD, this amount is further classified in accordance with the fair value hierarchy for observable market data that is consistent with the unit of account for the cash-generating unit being tested. The Group considers that the best evidence of FVLCD is the value obtained from an active market or binding sale agreement and, in this case, the recoverable amount is classified in the fair value hierarchy as level 1. When FVLCD is based on quoted prices for equity instruments but adjusted to reflect factors such as a lack of liquidity in the market, the recoverable amount is classified as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. No cash-generating units are currently assessed for impairment by reference to a recoverable amount based on FVLCD classified as level 1 or level 2.

This is often estimated using discounted cash flow techniques and is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Where the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is dependent on the life of its associated orebody, expected future cash flows reflect the current life of mine and long-term production plans, which are based on detailed research, analysis and iterative modelling to optimise the level of return from investment, output and sequence of extraction. The mine plan takes account of all relevant characteristics of the orebody, including waste-to-ore ratios, ore grades, haul distances, chemical and metallurgical properties of the ore impacting process recoveries and capacities of processing equipment that can be used. The life-of-mine plan and long-term production plans are, therefore, the basis for forecasting production output and production costs in each future year. (a) Capital expenditure for reportable segments includes the net cash outflow on purchases less disposals of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less disposals of other intangible assets. The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries' capital expenditure and Rio Tinto's share of the capital expenditure of joint operations. In 2022, we have excluded capitalised expenditure relating to equity accounted units and have adjusted prior year comparatives for this change in definition. (b) Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales of US$50 million (2021: US$44 million; 2020: US$34 million) to equity accounted units which are not included in segmental revenue. Segmental revenue includes the Group's proportionate share of product sales by equity accounted units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) of US$2,900 million (2021: US$3,117 million; 2020: US$2,441 million) which are not included in consolidated sales revenue.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount is assessed using FVLCD based on discounted cash flow techniques, the resulting estimates are based on detailed life-of-mine and long-term production plans. These may include anticipated expansions which are at the evaluation stage of study. Segmental revenue Segmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units in proportion to our equity interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). Segmental revenue measures revenue on a basis that is comparable to our underlying EBITDA metric.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts for FVLCD purposes are based on management's best estimates of expected future revenues and costs, including the future cash costs of production, capital expenditure, and closure, restoration and environmental costs. For the purposes of determining FVLCD from a market participant's perspective, the cash flows incorporate management's price and cost assumptions in the short and medium term. In the longer term, operating margins are assumed to remain constant where appropriate, as it is considered unlikely that a market participant would prepare detailed forecasts over a longer term. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected to be realised from the extraction, processing and sale of Forecast cash flows for ore reserve estimation for JORC purposes are generally based on Rio Tinto's commodity price forecasts, which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of the long-term price, generally over a period of three to five years. For most commodities, these forecast commodity prices are derived from a combination of analyses of the marginal costs of the producers and the incentive price of these commodities. These assessments often differ from current price levels and are updated periodically. The Group does not believe that published medium- and long-term forward prices necessarily provide a good indication of future levels because they tend to be strongly influenced by spot prices. The price forecasts used for ore reserve estimation are generally consistent with those used for Other segmental reporting For further information relating to Revenue by destination and product and Non-operating assets by geography refer to note 6 on page 170 and Our operating assets section on page 175 respectively.\n\n166\n\n162\n\nUS$m\n\n3,947\n\n1,300\n\n1,328\n\n61\n\n117",

        "page_content": "impairment testing unless management deems that in certain economic environments a market participant would not assume Rio Tinto's view on prices, in which case in preparing FVLCD impairment calculations management estimates the assumptions that a market participant would be expected to use.\n\nForecast future cash flows of a cash-generating unit take into account the sales prices under existing sales contracts.\n\nThe discount rates applied to the future cash flow forecasts represent an estimate of the rate the market participant would apply having regard to the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The Group's weighted average cost of capital is generally used as a starting point for determining the discount rates, with appropriate adjustments for the risk profile of the countries in which the individual cash-generating units operate. For final feasibility studies and ore reserve estimation, internal hurdle rates, which are generally higher than the Group's weighted average cost of capital, are used. For developments funded with project finance, the debt component of the weighted average cost of capital may be calculated by reference to the specific interest rate of the project finance and anticipated leverage of the project.\n\nFor operations with a functional currency other than the US dollar, the impairment review is undertaken in the relevant functional currency. In estimating FVLCD, internal forecasts of exchange rates take into account spot exchange rates, historical data and external forecasts, and are kept constant in real terms after five years. The great majority of the Group's sales are based on prices denominated in US dollars. To the\n\nextent that the currencies of countries in which the Group produces commodities strengthen against the US dollar without an increase in commodity prices, cash flows and, therefore, net present values are reduced. Management considers that, over the long term, there is a tendency for movements in commodity prices to compensate to some extent for movements in the value of the US dollar, particularly against the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, and vice versa. However, such compensating changes are not synchronised and do not fully offset each other. In estimating value in use, the present value of future cash flows in foreign currencies is translated at the spot exchange rate on the testing date.\n\nGenerally, discounted cash flow models are used to determine the recoverable amount of CGUs. In this case, significant judgment is required to determine the appropriate estimates and assumptions used and there is significant estimation uncertainty. In particular, for fair value less costs of disposal valuations, judgment is required to determine the estimates a market participant would use. The discounted cash flow models are most sensitive to the following estimates: the timing of project expansions; the cost to complete assets under construction; long-term commodity prices; production timing and recovery rates; exchange rates; operating costs; reserve and resource estimates; closure costs; discount rates; allocation of long-term contract revenues between CGUs; and, in some instances, the renewal of mining licences. Some of these variables are unique to an individual CGU. Future changes in these variables may differ from management's expectations and may materially alter the recoverable amounts of the CGUs.\n\n|                                                                                                     | Note   | Pre-tax amount 2022 US$m   | Taxation 2022 US$m   | Non- controlling interest 2022 US$m   | Net  amount 2022 US$m   | Pre-tax amount 2021 US$m   | Pre-tax amount 2020 US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Other operations -

Roughrider, Canada\n\nOn 17 October 2022, we completed the sale of the Roughrider uranium undeveloped project located in the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada for US$150 million (US$80 million in cash and US$70 million in shares of Uranium Energy Corp.). The project was fully impaired during the year ended 31 December 2017 due to significant uncertainty over whether commercially viable quantities of mineral resources could be identified at a future date. The sale therefore led to an impairment reversal in the current year. It also led to a loss on disposal being recognised of US$105 million arising from the recycling of the currency translation reserve to the income statement.\n\n167",

The plant operated with reduced capacity and the economic performance suffered due to the high cost of energy from the coal-fired Gladstone Power Station. These conditions have been identified as an impairment trigger.  We have calculated a recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit based on post-tax cash flows, expressed in real terms and discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6% over the period to 2029.  This date was chosen as it coincides with both the remaining term of the Boyne Smelter joint venture agreements and the Group's Paris-aligned commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 relative to the 2018 baseline. Despite the recent implementation of temporary energy price caps by the Australian Government, this resulted in an impairment charge of US$202 million, representing a full impairment of the carrying value of the Boyne Smelter investment in equity accounted unit.

For this reason, along with the coal price cap noted above, we have separated the Gladstone Power Station from the Boyne Smelter cash-generating unit.  As a sensitivity we have considered the impact of a potential repowering of the smelter using commodity and energy price assumptions from our Aspirational Leadership scenario, with all other assumptions being unchanged. This would result in improved cash flows, including an extension of operations at the Boyne Smelter beyond current joint venture agreements through to 2040. The potential value uplift under this sensitivity is not part of our base valuation as it is dependent upon commercial agreements that are not currently in place,  but could support the reversal of past impairments. Both the recorded outcome and the sensitivity, as described in 'Impact of climate change on the Group' section on pages 152 to 155, are considered to be Paris-aligned.

Construction spend was incurred by LNG Canada and therefore a gain of US$336 million representing the estimated fair value of the cost of construction was recorded and the carrying value of the Kitimat cash-generating unit (CGU) increased accordingly. Output from the smelter was reduced to 25% as a result of a workforce strike in mid-2021 and ramp-up to full capacity was expected to extend through into 2022. As a previously impaired CGU, and therefore carrying limited headroom, these factors were identified as conditions that could indicate that the uplifted carrying value may not be supportable and therefore the CGU was tested for impairment.

As a result of the decision to wind down operations, an impairment trigger was identified. The net present value of post-tax cash flows over the remaining life for this CGU was negative and therefore the non-current assets of the smelter were fully impaired. Minerals  - Diavik, Canada (a) Capital expenditure for reportable segments includes the net cash outflow on purchases less disposals of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less excluded capitalised expenditure relating to equity accounted units and have adjusted prior year comparatives for this change in definition. (b) Consolidated sales revenue includes subsidiary sales of US$50 million (2021: US$44 million; 2020: US$34 million) to equity accounted units which are not included in segmental revenue. Segmental revenue includes the Group's proportionate share of product sales by equity accounted units (after adjusting for sales to subsidiaries) of US$2,900 million (2021: US$3,117 million; 2020: US$2,441 million) which are not included in consolidated sales revenue.\n\n## Aluminium - Sohar, Oman\n\n61\n\n117\n\n7,384\n\nAdjusted\n\nIn 2020, the challenging outlook for the Middle Eastern aluminium industry was identified as an impairment trigger at the Sohar aluminium smelter in Oman, an equity accounted unit of the Group.

Subsequent restoration of smelter competitiveness resulting from improved power delivery terms represented an indicator of partial impairment reversal at 31 December 2020. We calculated a post-tax recoverable amount for the CGU of US$139 million at 31 December 2020 based on FVLCD, discounted using a post-tax rate of 6.6%. As a consequence, with full impairment of the CGU and a pre-tax impairment charge of US$204 million in the first half of 2020, followed by reversal of US$111 million to previously recorded pre-tax impairment in the second half of 2020, the full-year results for the year ended 31 December 2020 included a net pre-tax impairment charge of US$93 million.

In 2022, we have\n\nSegmental revenue\n\nHigh operating costs and challenging outlook for the aluminium industry also resulted in impairment triggers being identified at the Bell Bay aluminium smelter in Tasmania, Australia and at Boyne Smelter in Queensland, Australia at 30 June 2020. The forecast net present value of cash flows over the period to anticipated expiry in 2025 of a power contract with Hydro Tasmania was negative taking into account market conditions at the time. The property, plant and equipment of the Bell Bay smelter was therefore fully impaired. We determined the recoverable amount for our share of the Boyne Smelter CGU, which also included the Gladstone Power Station, as US$273 million based on post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms and discounted at 6.6%. Accordingly, our share of impairment after tax in the equity accounted unit was US$119 million (US$148 million pre-tax) related to the smelter and US$26 million (US$36 million pre-tax) related to the power station. Segmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units in proportion to our equity interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). Segmental revenue measures revenue on a basis that is comparable to our underlying EBITDA metric.

These circumstances were identified as an impairment trigger. The net present value of post-tax cash flows projected over the remaining life of the Diavik 'Diamond Mine' to 2025 did not support retaining any carrying value. This resulted in the Group's 60% interest in plant and equipment and intangible assets of the CGU being fully impaired at 30 June 2020.",

Where an acquisition does not meet the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' each asset is recognised on the balance sheet at fair value. In the Group cash flow statement we assess, based on the substance of the transaction, whether to allocate the cash consideration for these transactions either to 'Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets' or to 'Acquisitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates' depending on the type of assets purchased.\n\nFor undeveloped mining projects which have arisen through acquisition, the allocation of the purchase price consideration may result in undeveloped properties being recognised at an earlier stage of project evaluation compared with projects arising from the Group's exploration and evaluation programme. Subsequent expenditure on acquired undeveloped projects is only capitalised if it meets the high degree of confidence threshold discussed in note 12.\n\nWhere we increase our ownership interest in a subsidiary, the difference between the purchase price and the carrying value of the share of net assets acquired is recorded in equity. The cash cost of such purchases is included within 'financing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\n## 2022\n\nFollowing approval from Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), on 29 March 2022 we completed the acquisition of Rincon Mining Pty Limited, the owner of a lithium project in Argentina. Total cash consideration was US$825 million. In determining whether Rincon's set of activities is a business, we have assessed whether it has inputs and substantive processes which together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Based on this assessment, we have concluded that Rincon does not meet the definition of a business as defined by IFRS 3 \"Business Combinations\" and therefore no goodwill has been recorded. The transaction has therefore been treated as an asset purchase with US$822 million of capitalised exploration and evaluation recorded for the principal economic resource. The balance of total consideration has been allocated to property, plant & equipment and other assets/liabilities. For the Group cash flow statement we determined that, since Rincon constitutes a group of companies, it is appropriate to present the cash outflow as 'Acquisitions of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates' rather than as separate asset purchases even though it did not meet the definition of a business combination.\n\nOn 31 August 2022 we made a US$25 million investment in McEwen Copper Inc. through our copper leaching technology venture, Nuton. We accounted for our holding in McEwen Copper Inc as an investment in associate, given our representation on the board.\n\nOn 16 December 2022 we acquired the remaining 49% share of Turquoise Hill Resources for expected consideration of US$3.2 billion, inclusive of transaction costs. This transaction was not classified as a business combination as it related to the purchase of non-controlling interests in an entity already consolidated as a subsidiary. Accordingly the transaction did not result in the remeasurement of assets or liabilities and has been accounted for in the statement of equity as an adjustment to non-controlling interests and retained earnings.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 consideration paid amounted to US$2,961 million (including US$33 million of transaction costs, with further transaction costs of US$41 million expected to be paid in 2023). Certain shareholders exercised their right to dissent to the transaction. In accordance with the terms of the circular, those dissenting shareholders have received initial consideration of C$34.4 per share, with final consideration depending on the outcome and timing of dissent proceedings. We have included within other provisions (note 36) US$211 million for additional consideration to be paid to the dissenting\n\nshareholders representing the difference between their initial consideration and C$43 per share paid to all other shareholders.\n\n## 2021\n\nOn 18 November 2021, we announced that we had completed the acquisition of the 40% share in the Diavik Diamond Mine in the Northwest Territories of Canada held by Dominion Diamond Mines, becoming the sole owner as a result. The transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination and therefore the incremental assets and liabilities were treated as an asset purchase. Prior to purchase, we recognised our existing 60% share of assets, revenues and expenses, with liabilities recognised according to its contractual obligations, and a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset representing the co-owner's share where applicable. Receivables relating to the co-owner's share were de-recognised and treated as part of the net purchase consideration on completion.\n\n## Disposals\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIf a group of assets and liabilities ('Disposal group') is sold the carrying value of the disposal group is de-recognised with the difference between the carrying amount and the consideration received recognised in the income statement. Certain amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of the entity disposed of may be recycled to the income statement. The cash proceeds of disposals are included within 'Investing activities' in the cash flow statement.\n\nAs summarised in note 4, we sold our Roughrider uranium undeveloped project on 17 October 2022 for consideration of US$150 million (US$80 million in cash and US$70 million in shares of Uranium Energy Corp). There were no other material disposals in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\n\n## 6 Revenue by destination and product\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nWe recognise sales revenue related to the transfer of promised goods or services when control of the goods or services passes to the customer. The amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group is or expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nSales revenue is recognised on individual sales when control transfers to the customer. In most instances, control passes and sales revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the vessel or vehicle on which it will be transported once loaded, the destination port or the customer's premises. There may be circumstances when judgment is required based on the five indicators of control below:\n\n- -The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership and has the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service.\n- -The customer has a present obligation to pay in accordance with the terms of the sales contract. For shipments under the Incoterms Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)/Carriage Paid to (CPT)/Cost and Freight (CFR) this is generally when the ship is loaded, at which time the obligation for payment is for both product and freight.\n- -The customer has accepted the asset. Sales revenue may be subject to adjustment if the product specification does not conform to the terms specified in the sales contract but this does not impact the passing of control. Assay and specification adjustments have been immaterial historically.\n- -The customer has legal title to the asset. The Group usually retains legal title until payment is received for credit risk purposes only.\n- -The customer has physical possession of the asset. This indicator may be less important as the customer may obtain control of an asset prior to obtaining physical possession, which may be the case for goods in transit.\n\n169",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2022 financial statements\n\n## 6 Revenue by destination and product continued\n\nRevenue is principally derived from sale of commodities. We sell the majority of our products on CFR or CIF Incoterms. This means that the Group is responsible (acts as principal) for providing shipping services and, in some instances, insurance after the date at which control of goods passes to the customer at the loading port. The Group, therefore, has separate performance obligations for freight and insurance services that are provided solely to facilitate sale of the products it produces. Other Incoterms commonly used by the Group are Free on Board (FOB), where the Group has no responsibility for freight or insurance once control of the goods has passed at the loading port, and Delivered at Place (DAP), where control of the goods passes when the product is delivered to the agreed destination. For these Incoterms there is only one performance obligation, being the provision of product at the point where control passes.\n\nWithin each sales contract, each unit of product shipped is a separate performance obligation. Revenue is generally recognised at the contracted price as this reflects the stand-alone selling price. Sales revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes. Sales of copper concentrate are stated net of the treatment and refining charges which will be required to convert it to an end product.\n\nThe Group's products are sold to customers under contracts which vary in tenure and pricing mechanisms, including some volumes sold on the spot market. Pricing for iron ore is on a range of terms, the majority being either monthly or quarterly average pricing mechanisms, with a smaller proportion of iron ore volumes being sold on the spot market.\n\nCertain of the Group's products may be provisionally priced at the date revenue is recognised and a provisional invoice issued; however, substantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices in the results for the period. Provisionally priced receivables are subsequently measured at fair value through the income statement under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' as described in note 24. The final selling price for all provisionally priced products is based on the price for the quotational period stipulated in the contract. Final prices for copper\n\nconcentrate are normally determined between 30 and 120 days after delivery to the customer. The change in value of the provisionally priced receivable is based on relevant forward market prices and is included in sales revenue; refer to 'Other revenue' within the sales by product disclosure below.\n\nRevenues from the sale of significant by-products, such as gold, are included in sales revenue. Third-party commodity swap arrangements principally for delivery and receipt of smelter-grade alumina are offset within operating costs. Sundry revenue incidental to the main revenuegenerating activities of the operations is treated as a credit to operating costs.\n\nTypically, the Group has a right to payment before or at the point that control of the goods passes including a right, where applicable, to payment for provisionally priced products and unperformed freight and insurance services. Cash received before control passes is recognised as a contract liability. The amount of consideration does not contain a significant financing component as payment terms are less than one year. We have a number of long-term contracts to supply products to customers in future periods. Generally, revenue is recognised on an invoice basis, as each unit sold is a separate performance obligation and therefore the right to consideration from a customer corresponds directly with our performance completed to date.\n\nWe do not disclose sales revenue from freight and insurance services separately as we do not consider that this is necessary in order to understand the impact of economic factors on the Group. Our Chief Executive, the chief operating decision maker as defined under IFRS 8 'Operating Segments', does not review information specifically relating to these sources of revenue in order to evaluate the performance of business segments and Group information on these sources of revenue is not provided externally. We do provide information on freight revenue for the iron ore and bauxite businesses on pages 37 and 39 to help stakeholders understand FOB operating margins for those products.\n\nWe apply the practical expedient in paragraph 121 of IFRS 15 and do not include information on the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied.\n\n## Consolidated sales revenue by destination (a)\n\n|                                          |   2022 % |   Adjusted (b) 2021 % |   Adjusted (b) 2020 % | 2022 US$m   | Adjusted (b) 2021 US$m   | Adjusted (b) 2020 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Greater China (b)                        |     54.3 |                  59.7 |                  60.4 | 30,172      | 37,878                   | 26,951                   |\n| United States of America                 |     15.9 |                  12.6 |                  10.9 | 8,823       | 8,012                    | 4,867                    |\n| Asia (excluding Greater China and Japan) |      7.1 |                   6.9 |                   7.9 | 3,937       | 4,415                    | 3,525                    |\n| Japan                                    |      7.4 |                   7.9 |                   7.5 | 4,091       | 5,012                    | 3,354                    |\n| Europe (excluding UK)                    |      6.5 |                   5.2 |                   5.9 | 3,618       | 3,271                    | 2,623                    |\n| Canada                                   |      3.1 |                   2.6 |                   2.9 | 1,743       | 1,677                    | 1,289                    |\n| Australia                                |      1.9 |                   1.8 |                   1.7 | 1,047       | 1,122                    | 745                      |\n| UK                                       |      0.3 |                   0.4 |                   0.5 | 182         | 243                      | 242                      |\n| Other countries                          |      3.5 |                   2.9 |                   2.3 | 1,941       | 1,865                    | 1,015                    |\n| Consolidated sales revenue               |    100   |                 100   |                 100   | 55,554      | 63,495                   | 44,611                   |\n\n170",

Expenditure on exploration activity undertaken by the Group is not capitalised.\n\nEvaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been identified as having economic potential. These costs are also expensed until the business case for the project is sufficiently advanced. For greenfield projects, expensing typically continues to a later phase of study compared with brownfield expansions.\n\nThe charge for the year and the net amount of intangible assets capitalised during the year are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                    | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Expenditure in the year (inclusive of cash proceeds of US$1 million (2021: US$7 million; 2020: US$1 million) on disposal  of undeveloped projects) | (1,097)      | (852)       | (711)       |\n| Non-cash movements and non-cash proceeds on disposal of undeveloped projects                                                                       | (6)          | 23          | -           |\n| Amount capitalised during the year                                                                                                                 | 207          | 110         | 87          |\n| Exploration and evaluation expenditure (net of profit relating to interests in undeveloped projects) per income  statement                         | (896)        | (719)       | (624)       |\n\n## 9 Finance income and finance costs\n\n|                                                                                                      | Note   | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Finance income from equity accounted units                                                           |        | 3            | 2           | 4           |\n| Other finance income (including bank deposits, net investment in leases, and other financial assets) |        | 176          | 62          | 137         |\n| Total finance income                                                                                 |        | 179          | 64          | 141         |\n| Interest on:                                                                                         |        |              |             |             |\n| - Financial liabilities at amortised cost (excluding lease liabilities) and associated derivatives   |        | (713)        | (489)       | (561)       |\n| - Lease liabilities                                                                                  |        | (49)         | (47)        | (50)        |\n| Fair value movements:                                                                                |        |              |             |             |\n| - Bonds designated as hedged items in fair value hedges (a)                                          |        | 526          | 246         | (284)       |\n| - Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in fair value hedges (a)                             |        | (515)        | (242)       | 287         |\n| Loss on early redemption of bonds                                                                    |        | -            | (69)        | -           |\n| Amounts capitalised (b)                                                                              | 13     | 416          | 358         | 340         |\n| Total finance costs                                                                                  |        | (335)        | (243)       | (268)       |\n\n## 10   Taxation\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe taxation charge contains both current and deferred tax.\n\nCurrent tax is the tax expected to be payable on the taxable income for the year calculated using rates applicable during the year. It includes adjustments for tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of previous periods. Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, we establish provisions based on either: the Group's judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery; or, when there is a wide range of possible outcomes, a probability weighted average approach.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated in accordance with IAS 12 using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and off-setting temporary differences, we apply the Initial Recognition Exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognise neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences. Primarily this occurs with new lease arrangements and changes in closure cost estimates for assets in operation. Under the amendment to IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities will be required to be recognised in respect of such temporary differences (Refer to note 40 on page 222).\n\n172",

        "page_content": "## Other relevant judgments - Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group operates across a large number of jurisdictions and is subject to review and challenge by local tax authorities on a range of tax matters.  Where the amount of tax payable or recoverable is uncertain, whether due to the local tax authority challenge or due to uncertainty regarding the appropriate treatment, judgment is required to assess the probability that the adopted treatment will be accepted.  In accordance with IFRIC 23, if it is not probable that the treatment will be accepted, the Group accounts for uncertain tax provisions for all matters worldwide based on the Group's judgment of the most likely amount of the liability or recovery, or where there is a wide range of possible outcomes, using a probability weighted average approach. Uncertain tax provisions include any related interest and penalties.\n\nIn July 2022 we reached agreement with the Australian Tax Office (ATO) on all tax matters in dispute. We also reached agreement with the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore in relation to transfer pricing for the same historical years (2010 to 2021).\n\n## Taxation charge\n\n|                       | Note   | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| - Current             |        | 4,851        | 8,144       | 5,169       |\n| - Deferred            | 15     | 735          | 114         | (178)       |\n| Total taxation charge |        | 5,586        | 8,258       | 4,991       |\n\n## Prima facie tax reconciliation\n\n|                                                                                        | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m Adjusted (i)   | 2020 US$m Adjusted (i)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Profit before taxation (a)                                                             | 18,662       | 30,833                   | 15,391                   |\n| Prima facie tax payable at UK rate of 19% (2021: 19%; 2020: 19%) (b)                   | 3,546        | 5,858                    | 2,924                    |\n| Higher rate of taxation of 30% on Australian earnings (2021: 30%; 2020: 30%)           | 1,550        | 2,598                    | 1,748                    |\n| Other tax rates applicable outside the UK and Australia                                | (17)         | 103                      | (181)                    |\n| Tax effect of profit from equity accounted units, related impairments and expenses (a) | (109)        | (198)                    | (59)                     |\n| Impact of changes in tax rates                                                         | (11)         | -                        | -                        |\n| Resource depletion allowances                                                          | (40)         | (52)                     | (34)                     |\n| Recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets (c)                         | (261)        | (212)                    | (182)                    |\n| Write-down of previously recognised deferred tax assets (d)                            | 820          | -                        | 237                      |\n| Utilisation of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets (e)                         | (37)         | (200)                    | (15)                     |\n| Unrecognised current year operating losses (f)                                         | 212          | 107                      | 328                      |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior periods (g)                                            | (222)        | 40                       | 9                        |\n| Other items (h)                                                                        | 155          | 214                      | 216                      |\n| Total taxation charge                                                                  | 5,586        | 8,258                    | 4,991                    |\n\n173",

The recoverable amount has been assessed by reference to FVLCD, in line with the policy set out in note 4 and classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. FVLCD was determined by estimating cash flows until the end of the life-of-mine plan including anticipated expansions. In arriving at FVLCD, a post-tax discount rate of 8.6% (2021: 8.6%) has been applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.\n\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of FVLCD for Richards Bay Minerals is most sensitive and the corresponding change in FVLCD are set out below:\n\n|                                                                 | 2022  US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| 5% increase in the titanium slag price                          | 207          |\n| 1% increase in the discount rate applied to post-tax cash flows | (140)        |\n| 10% strengthening of the South African rand                     | 263          |\n\nOther assumptions include the long-term pig iron and zircon prices and operating costs. Future selling prices and operating costs have been estimated in line with the policy set out in note 4. The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds the carrying value when each of these sensitivities is applied while keeping all other assumptions constant.\n\n## 12   Intangible assets\n\n## Recognition and measurement - Intangible assets\n\nPurchased intangible assets are initially recorded at cost. Finite-life intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate. Intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives and intangible assets that are not yet ready for use are not amortised; they are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.\n\nThe majority of our intangible assets relate to capitalised exploration and evaluation spend and contract-based water rights. The water rights were acquired with Alcan in Canada.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\nEvaluation expenditure relates to a detailed assessment of deposits or other projects (including smelter and refinery projects) that have been identified as having economic potential. Capitalisation of evaluation expenditure commences when there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will determine that a project is commercially viable; that is, the project will provide a satisfactory return relative to its perceived risks, and therefore it is considered probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The Group's view is that a high degree of confidence is greater than 'more likely than not' (that is, greater than 50% certainty) and less than 'virtually certain' (that is, less than 90% certainty).\n\nAssessing whether there is a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that an evaluation project is commercially viable requires judgment and consideration of all relevant factors such as the nature and objective of the project; the project's current stage; project timeline; current estimates of the project's net present value, including sensitivity analyses for the key assumptions; and the main risks of the project. Development expenditure incurred prior to the decision to proceed is subject to the same criteria for capitalisation, being a high degree of confidence that the Group will ultimately determine that a project is commercially viable.\n\nIn some cases, undeveloped projects are regarded as successors to orebodies, smelters or refineries currently in production. Where this is the case, it is intended that these will be developed and go into production when the current source of ore is exhausted or when existing smelters or refineries are closed. Ore reserves may be declared for an undeveloped mining project before its commercial viability has been fully determined. Evaluation costs may continue to be capitalised in between declaration of ore reserves and approval to mine as further work is undertaken in order to refine the development case to maximise the project's returns.\n\n## Contract-based intangible assets\n\nThe majority of the carrying value of our contract-based intangible assets relate to water rights in the Quebec region. These contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our aluminium operations as they enable us to generate electricity from hydropower stations.\n\n## Other relevant judgments - Assessment of indefinite-lived water rights in Quebec, Canada\n\nWe continue to judge the water rights in Quebec to have an indefinite life because we expect the contractual rights to contribute to the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our operations for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the rights are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. We have no other indefinite-lived assets.\n\nThe remaining carrying value of the water rights of US$1,693 million (included in contract based assets) as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$1,796 million) relates wholly to the Quebec smelters cash-generating unit (CGU). The Quebec smelters CGU was tested for impairment by reference to FVLCD using discounted cash flows. The recoverable amount of the Quebec smelters is classified as level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. In arriving at FVLCD, post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms have been estimated over the expected useful economic lives of the underlying smelting assets and discounted using a real post-tax discount rate of 6.6% (2021: 6.6%).\n\nThe recoverable amounts were determined to be significantly in excess of carrying value, and there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions that would cause the remaining water rights to be impaired.\n\n176",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2022 financial statements\n\n## 13   Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, as defined in IAS 16, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of property, plant and equipment includes, where applicable, the estimated close-down and restoration costs associated with the asset.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment includes right of use assets arising from leasing arrangements, shown separately from owned and leasehold assets.\n\nOnce an undeveloped mining project has been determined as commercially viable and approval to mine has been given, expenditure other than that on land, buildings, plant, equipment and capital work in progress is capitalised under 'Mining properties and leases' together with any amount transferred from 'Exploration and evaluation'.\n\nCosts incurred while commissioning new assets, in the period before they are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are capitalised unless associated with pre-production revenue (refer to page 155). Development costs incurred after the commencement of production are capitalised to the extent they are expected to give rise to a future economic benefit. Interest on borrowings related to construction or development projects is capitalised, at the rate payable on project-specific debt if applicable or at the Group or subsidiary's cost of borrowing if not.\n\nThis is performed until the point when substantially all the activities that are necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use are complete. It may be appropriate to use a subsidiary's cost of borrowing when the debt was negotiated based on the financing requirements of that subsidiary.\n\n## Depreciation of non-current assets\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life, or over the remaining life of the mine, smelter or refinery if that is shorter and there is no reasonable alternative use for the asset by the Group. Depreciation commences when an asset is available for use. Assets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis as follows:\n\nType of Property, plant and equipment\n\nLand and Buildings\n\nPlant and equipment\n\nCapital work in progress\n\nLand\n\nBuildings\n\nPower assets\n\nOther plant and equipment\n\nDepreciation profile\n\nNot depreciated\n\n5 to 50 years\n\nSee Power note below\n\n3 to 50 years\n\nNot depreciated\n\nThe useful lives and residual values for material assets and categories of assets are reviewed annually and changes are reflected prospectively.\n\n## Units of production basis\n\nFor mining properties and leases and certain mining equipment, consumption of the economic benefits of the asset is linked to production. Except as noted below, these assets are depreciated on the units of production basis.\n\nIn applying the units of production method, depreciation is normally calculated based on production in the period as a percentage of total expected production in current and future periods based on ore reserves and, for some mines, other mineral resources. Other mineral resources may be included in the calculations of total expected production in limited circumstances where there are very large areas of contiguous mineralisation, for which the economic viability is not sensitive to likely variations in grade, as may be the case for certain iron ore, bauxite and industrial mineral deposits, and where there is a high degree of confidence that the other mineral resources can be extracted economically. This would be the case when the other mineral resources do not yet have the status of ore reserves merely because the necessary detailed evaluation work has not yet been performed and the responsible technical personnel agree that inclusion of a proportion of measured and indicated resources in the calculation of total expected production is appropriate based on historical reserve conversion rates.\n\nThe required level of confidence is unlikely to exist for minerals that are typically found in low-grade ore (as compared with the above), such as copper or gold. In these cases, specific areas of mineralisation have to be evaluated in detail before their economic status can be predicted with confidence.\n\nSometimes the calculation of depreciation for infrastructure assets, primarily rail and port, considers measured and indicated resources. This is because the asset can benefit current and future mines. The measured and indicated resource may relate to mines which are currently in production or to mines where there is a high degree of confidence that they will be brought into production in the future. The quantum of mineral resources is determined taking into account future capital costs as required by the JORC code. The depreciation calculation, however, applies to current mines only and does not take into account future development costs for mines which are not yet in production. Measured and indicated resources are currently incorporated into depreciation calculations in the Group's Australian iron ore business.\n\n## Key judgment - Estimation of asset lives\n\nThe useful lives of the major assets of a cash-generating unit are often dependent on the life of the orebody to which they relate. Where this is the case, the lives of mining properties, and their associated refineries, concentrators and other long-lived processing equipment are generally limited to the expected life of the orebody. The life of the orebody, in turn, is estimated on the basis of the life-of-mine plan. Where the major assets of a cash-generating unit are not dependent on the life of a related orebody, management applies judgment in estimating the remaining service potential of long-lived assets. Factors affecting the remaining service potential of smelters include, for example, smelter technology and electricity purchase contracts when power is not sourced from the Group, or in some cases from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.\n\n178",

        "page_content": "## Impact of climate change on our business - Estimation of asset lives\n\nWe expect there to be a higher demand for copper, aluminium, lithium and high grade iron ore in order to meet demand for the minerals required to transition to a low carbon economic environment, consistent with the climate change commitments of the Paris Agreement. We expect this to exceed new supply to the market and therefore increase prices.  Under the Aspirational Leadership scenario, the economic cutoff grade for our Ore Reserves is expected to be lower; in effect we would mine a greater volume of material before the mines are depleted. We cannot quantify the difference this would make without undue cost as it would require revised mine plans, but for property, plant and equipment this increased volume of material would reduce the depreciation charge for assets that use the 'Units of production' depreciation method.\n\n## Straight line basis\n\nAssets within operations for which production is not expected to fluctuate significantly from one year to another or which have a physical life shorter than the related mine are depreciated on a straight line basis.\n\n## Deferred stripping\n\nIn open pit mining operations, overburden and other waste materials must be removed to access ore from which minerals can be extracted economically. The process of removing overburden and waste materials is referred to as stripping. During the development of a mine (or, in some instances, pit; see below), before production commences, stripping costs related to a component of an orebody are capitalised as part of the cost of construction of the mine (or pit). These are then amortised over the life of the mine (or pit) on a units of production basis.\n\nWhere a mine operates several open pits that are regarded as separate operations for the purpose of mine planning, initial stripping costs are accounted for separately by reference to the ore from each separate pit. If, however, the pits are highly integrated for the purpose of mine planning, the second and subsequent pits are regarded as extensions of the first pit in accounting for stripping costs. In such cases, the initial stripping (such as overburden and other waste removal) of the second and subsequent pits is considered to be production phase stripping (see below).\n\n## Key judgment - Deferral of stripping costs\n\nWe apply judgment as to whether multiple pits at a mine are considered separate or integrated operations. This determines whether the stripping activities of a pit are classified as pre-production or production phase stripping and, therefore, the amortisation base for those costs. The analysis depends on each mine's specific circumstances and requires judgment: another mining company could make a different judgment even when the fact pattern appears to be similar.\n\nThe following factors would point towards the initial stripping costs for the individual pits being accounted for separately:\n\n- - If mining of the second and subsequent pits is conducted consecutively following that of the first pit, rather than concurrently;\n- - If separate investment decisions are made to develop each pit, rather than a single investment decision being made at the outset;\n- - If the pits are operated as separate units in terms of mine planning and the sequencing of overburden removal and ore mining, rather than as an integrated unit;\n- - If expenditures for additional infrastructure to support the second and subsequent pits are relatively large; and\n- - If the pits extract ore from separate and distinct orebodies, rather than from a single orebody.\n\nIf the designs of the second and subsequent pits are significantly influenced by opportunities to optimise output from several pits combined, including the co-treatment or blending of the output from the pits, then this would point to treatment as an integrated operation for the purposes of accounting for initial stripping costs. The relative importance of each of the above factors is considered in each case.\n\nIn order for production phase stripping costs to qualify for capitalisation as a stripping activity asset, three criteria must be met:\n\n- - It must be probable that there will be an economic benefit in a future accounting period because the stripping activity has improved access to the orebody;\n- - It must be possible to identify the 'component' of the orebody for which access has been improved; and\n- - It must be possible to reliably measure the costs that relate to the stripping activity.\n\nA 'component' is a specific section of the orebody that is made more accessible by the stripping activity. It will typically be a subset of the larger orebody that is distinguished by a separate useful economic life (for example, a pushback).\n\n179",

We expect to spend US$7.5 billion between 2022 and 2030. Transitioning electricity from principally fossil fuel-based power generating assets to principally renewables is critical to achieving that goal. The carrying value of power generating assets is set out in the table below. The weighted average remaining useful economic life of plant and equipment for fossil fuelbased power generating assets is 13 years (2021:14 years). Given the technical limitations of intermittent renewable energy generation and energy storage systems, and our need for reliable baseload electricity, we expect our current generation assets will be integral to those needs for the foreseeable future. We are investing in research and development and evaluating new market options that may overcome these technical challenges. Should pathways for eliminating fossil fuel power generating assets be identified we may need to accelerate depreciation or impair the assets; however, at this present moment the requirement for fossil fuel powered back-up means that early retirement of the assets is not expected.\n\n|                | 2022               | 2022                     | 2021 Plant         | 2021 Plant    |\n|----------------|--------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|---------------|\n|                | Land and buildings | Plant and equipment US$m | Land and buildings | and equipment |\n| Net book value | US$m               |                          | US$m               | US$m          |\n| Fossil fuels   | 25                 | 882                      | 26                 | 952           |\n| Renewables (a) | 198                | 2,352                    | 195                | 1,541         |\n\n181",

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions. Right of use assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over the life of the lease, taking into account any extensions that are likely to be enacted.\n\n## 14   Close-down and restoration provisions\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group has provisions for close-down and restoration costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. The obligation may occur during development or during the production phase of a facility. These provisions are based on all regulatory requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders. The provision excludes the impact of future disturbance which is planned to occur during the life of mine, so that it represents only incurred disturbance as at the balance sheet date.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated, instead a contingent liability is disclosed, refer to note 37. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinite-lived water rights from local governments permitting electricity generation from hydro-power stations.\n\nClose-down and restoration costs are a normal consequence of mining or production, and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred in the years following closure of the mine, refinery or smelter. Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their costs using current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions. The costs are estimated on the basis of a closure plan, and are reviewed at each reporting period during the life of the operation to reflect known developments. The estimates are also subject to formal review, with appropriate external support, at regular intervals.\n\nThe timing of closure and the rehabilitation plans for the site can be uncertain and dependent upon future capital allocation decisions which involve estimation of future economic circumstances and business cases. In such circumstances, the closure provision is estimated using probability weighting of the different remediation and closure scenarios.\n\nThe initial close-down and restoration provision is capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment'. Subsequent movements in the closedown and restoration provisions for ongoing operations are treated as an adjustment to cost within 'Property, plant and equipment'. This includes those resulting from new disturbance related to expansions or other activities qualifying for capitalisation; updated cost estimates; changes to the estimated lives of operations; changes to the timing of closure activities; and revisions to discount rates.\n\nChanges in closure provisions relating to closed operations are charged/credited to 'Net operating costs' in the income statement.\n\n182\n\nWhere rehabilitation is conducted systematically over the life of the operation, rather than at the time of closure, provision is made for the estimated outstanding continuous rehabilitation work at each balance sheet date and the cost is charged to the income statement.\n\nThe closure provision is represented by forecast future underlying cash flows expressed in real terms at the balance sheet date. These are discounted for the time value of money based on a long-term view of low-risk market yields which includes a review of historic trends plus risks and opportunities for which future cash flows have not been adjusted, namely potential improvements in closure practices between the reporting date and the point at which rehabilitation spend takes place. The real-terms discount rate used is 1.5% (2021: 1.5%) which is applied to all locations since we expect to meet closure cash flows principally from US dollar revenues and financing, with activities coordinated by the Group's central closure team.\n\nTo roll forward those real-terms cash flows between periods, we identify local rates of inflation based on Producer Price Inflation (PPI) indices and together with the real-terms discount rate unwind the discount through the line 'amortisation of discount', shown within 'Finance items' in the income statement.  This nominal rate for cost escalation in the current financial year is estimated at the start of each half-year and applied systematically for six months.  At the end of each half-year we update the underlying cash flows for the latest estimate of experienced inflation for the current financial year and record this as 'changes to existing provisions'.  For operating sites this adjustment usually results in a corresponding adjustment to Property, Plant and Equipment and for closed and fully impaired sites the adjustment is charged or credited to the income statement.\n\nIn some cases, our subsidiaries make a contribution to trust funds in order to meet or reimburse future environmental and decommissioning costs. Amounts due for reimbursement from trust funds are not offset against the corresponding closure provision unless payments into the fund have the effect of passing the closure obligation to the trust.\n\nEnvironmental costs result from environmental damage that was not a necessary consequence of operations, and may include remediation, compensation and penalties. Provision is made for the estimated present value of such costs at the balance sheet date. These costs are charged to 'Net operating costs', except for the unwinding of the discount which is shown within 'Finance items'.\n\nRemediation procedures may commence soon after the time the disturbance, remediation process and estimated remediation costs become known, but can continue for many years depending on the nature of the disturbance and the remediation techniques used.",

Significant judgment is also required to determine both the costs associated with that work and the other assumptions used to calculate the provision. External experts support the cost estimation process where appropriate but there remains significant estimation uncertainty.\n\nThe key judgment in applying this accounting policy is determining when an estimate is sufficiently reliable to make or adjust a closure provision. Adjustments are made to provisions when the range of possible outcomes becomes sufficiently narrow to permit reliable estimation. Depending on the materiality of the change, adjustments may require review and endorsement by the Group's Closure Steering Committee before the provision is updated.\n\nCost estimates are updated throughout the life of the operation; generally cost estimates must comply with the Group's Capital Project Framework once the operation is ten years from expected closure. This means, for example, that where an Order of Magnitude (OoM) study is required for closure it must be of the same standard as an OoM study for a new mine, smelter or refinery. As at 31 December 2022, there are 16 operations with remaining lives of under 10 years before taking into account unapproved extensions. The largest closure study finalised during 2022 related to the Ranger Uranium mine operated by Energy Resources of Australia.  In 2021 the preliminary information from this study resulted in an increase to closure liabilities of US$510 million; the finalisation of the study in 2022 did not result in a further significant change.\n\nIn some cases, the closure study may indicate that monitoring and, potentially, remediation will be required indefinitely - for example, ground water treatment. In these cases the underlying cash flows for the provision may be restricted to a period for which the costs can be reliably estimated, which on average is around 30 years. Where an alternative commercial arrangement to meet our obligations can be predicted with confidence, this period may be shorter.\n\nClosure provisions are not made for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the closure dates cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to certain Canadian smelters which have indefinite-lived water rights or power agreements for renewable power sources with local governments, refer to note 37.\n\n183",

Although the ultimate cost to be incurred is uncertain, the Group's businesses estimate their respective costs based on current restoration standards, techniques and expected climate conditions.\n\n## Key estimate - Close-down, restoration and environmental obligations\n\nThe most significant assumptions and estimates used in calculating the provision are:\n\n- - Closure timeframes. The weighted average remaining lives of operations is shown below. Some expenditure may be incurred before closure while the operation as a whole is in production.\n- - The length of any post-closure monitoring period. This will depend on the specific site requirements and the availability of alternative commercial arrangements; some expenditure can continue into perpetuity. The Rio Tinto Kennecott closure and environmental remediation provision includes an allowance for ongoing monitoring and remediation costs, including ground water treatment, of approximately US$0.7 billion.\n- - The probability weighting of possible closure scenarios. The most significant impact of probability weighting is at the Pilbara operations (Iron Ore) relating to infrastructure and incorporates the expectation that some infrastructure will be retained by the relevant State authorities post closure. The assignment of probabilities to this scenario reduces the closure provision by US$0.7 billion.\n- - Appropriate sources on which to base the calculation of the discount rate. The discount rate by nature is subjective and therefore sensitivities are shown below for how the provision balance, which at 31 December 2022 was US$15.8 billion, would change if discounted at alternative discount rates.\n\nThere is significant estimation uncertainty in the calculation of the provision and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including:\n\n- - Changes to the relevant legal or local/national government requirements and any other commitments made to stakeholders;\n- - Review of remediation and relinquishment options;\n- - Additional remediation requirements identified during the rehabilitation;\n- - The emergence of new restoration techniques;\n- - Precipitation rates and climate change;\n- - Change in the expected closure date; and\n- - Change in the discount rate.\n\nExperience gained at other mine or production sites may also change expected methods or costs of closure, although elements of the restoration and rehabilitation can be unique to each site. Generally, there is relatively limited restoration and rehabilitation activity and historical precedent elsewhere in the Group, or in the industry as a whole, against which to benchmark cost estimates.\n\nThe expected timing of expenditure can also change for other reasons, for example because of changes to expectations relating to ore reserves and mineral resources, production rates, renewal of operating licences or economic conditions.\n\nChanges in closure estimates at the Group's ongoing operations could result in a material adjustment to assets and liabilities in the next 12 months and would also impact the depreciation and the unwind of discount in future years.\n\nChanges to closure cost estimates for closed operations, and changes to environmental cost estimates at any operation, could cause a material adjustment to the income statement and closure liability. We do not consider that there is significant risk of a change in estimates for these liabilities causing a material adjustment to the income statement in the next 12 months.  Any new environmental incidents may require a material provision but cannot be predicted.\n\nProject specific risks are embedded within the cash flows which are based on a central case estimate of closure activities assuming that the obligation is fulfilled by the Group. These cash flows are then discounted using a discount rate specific to the class of obligations.\n\n184",

        "page_content": "Provisions of US$15,759 million (2021: US$14,542 million) for close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations are based on risk-adjusted cash flows. We re-assessed the closure discount rate in the current year and continue to consider that real rate of 1.5%, applied prospectively since 30 September 2020, is the most appropriate rate to use. This assumption is based on the currency in which we plan to fund the closures and our expectation of long-term interest rate and exchange rate parity in the locations of our operations. Prior to 30 September 2020 and in recent years, the close-down and restoration costs and environmental clean-up obligations were discounted at a real rate of 2.0%. To illustrate the sensitivity of the provision to discounting, if the discount rate at 31 December 2022 were decreased to 1.0% then the provision would be US$1.5 billion higher, of which approximately US$1.4 billion would be capitalised within 'Property, plant and equipment' at operating sites and US$0.1 billion would be charged to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites. If the discount rate were increased to 3.0% then the provision would be US$3.0 billion lower, of which approximately US$2.7 billion would result in a decrease within 'Property, plant and equipment' at operating sites and US$0.3 billion would be credited to the income statement for non-operating and fully impaired sites.\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - Close-down, restoration and environmental cost\n\nThe underlying costs for closure have been estimated with varying degrees of precision based on a function of the age of the underlying asset and proximity to closure. For assets within ten years of closure, closure plans and cost estimates are supported by detailed studies which are refined as the closure date approaches. These closure studies consider climate change and plan for resilience to expected climate conditions with a particular focus on precipitation rates. For new developments, consideration of climate change and ultimate closure conditions are an important part of the approval process. For longer-lived assets, closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every five years; these are evolving to incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.\n\n| Closure cost composition as at 31 December        | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Decommissioning, decontamination and demolition   | 3,386        | 3,343       |\n| Closure and rehabilitation earthworks (a)         | 4,760        | 4,125       |\n| Long-term water management costs (b)              | 1,092        | 967         |\n| Post closure monitoring and maintenance           | 1,846        | 1,676       |\n| Indirect costs, owners' costs and contingency (c) | 4,675        | 4,431       |\n| Total                                             | 15,759       | 14,542      |\n\n| Geographic composition as at 31 December   | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Australia                                  | 7,983        | 7,605       |\n| USA                                        | 4,680        | 4,057       |\n| Canada                                     | 1,730        | 1,662       |\n| Rest of World                              | 1,366        | 1,218       |\n| Total                                      | 15,759       | 14,542      |\n\nThe geographic composition of the closure provision shows that our closure obligations are largely in countries with established levels of regulation in respect of mine and site closure.\n\n185",

These risk factors include the risk of expiry of losses prior to utilisation, the impact of other legislation or tax regimes, such as minimum taxes, and consideration of factors that lead to the generation of losses or other deferred tax assets.\n\nIAS 12 requires us to consider whether taxable profits will be available against which deferred tax assets may be utilised. The enactment in the US of the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) in the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 has resulted in a position where, whilst the utilisation of Federal deferred tax assets will reduce our Federal corporate tax liabilities, the CAMT legislation will result in the application of the minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income. Accordingly, whilst our latest projections demonstrate that sufficient taxable profits will be earned in future periods to utilise the existing Federal deferred tax assets, the utilisation of those Federal deferred tax assets is not expected to yield any significant economic benefit due to the application of the minimum tax and the deferred tax assets have been written down.\n\n|                                                             | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January - deferred tax (liabilities)/assets            | (128)        | 146         |\n| Adjustment on currency translation                          | 124          | 61          |\n| (Charged)/credited to the income statement                  | (735)        | (114)       |\n| (Charged)/credited to statement of comprehensive income (a) | (102)        | (243)       |\n| Other movements (b)                                         | 6            | 22          |\n| At 31 December - deferred tax liabilities                   | (835)        | (128)       |\n| Comprising:                                                 |              |             |\n| - deferred tax assets (c)(d)                                | 2,766        | 3,375       |\n| - deferred tax liabilities (e)                              | (3,601)      | (3,503)     |\n\n186",

Third-party production purchased for our own use that is ordinarily interchangeable in accordance with IAS 2 is valued on the same basis, jointly with our own production. Average costs are calculated by reference to the cost levels experienced in the relevant month together with those in opening inventory.\n\nThe cost of raw materials and consumable stores is the purchase price. The cost of partly-processed and saleable products is generally the cost of production, including directly attributable labour costs, materials and contractor expenses, the depreciation of assets used in production and production overheads.\n\nWork in progress includes ore stockpiles and other partly processed material. Stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted and is available for further processing. If there is significant uncertainty as to if and when the stockpiled ore will be processed, the cost of such ore is expensed as mined. If the ore will not be processed within 12 months after the balance sheet date, it is included within non-current assets and net realisable value is calculated on a discounted cash flow basis. Quantities of stockpiled ore are assessed primarily through surveys and assays. Certain estimates, including expected metal recoveries, are calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data, and are periodically reassessed, taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\n|                                              | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Raw materials and purchased components       | 1,235        | 870         |\n| Consumable stores                            | 1,327        | 1,142       |\n| Work in progress                             | 2,086        | 1,736       |\n| Finished goods and goods for resale          | 1,768        | 1,884       |\n| Total inventories                            | 6,416        | 5,632       |\n| Comprising:                                  |              |             |\n| Expected to be used within one year          | 6,213        | 5,436       |\n| Expected to be used after more than one year | 203          | 196         |\n| Total inventories                            | 6,416        | 5,632       |\n\nDuring 2022, the Group recognised a net inventory write-off of US$55 million (2021:US$7 million write-back.) This included inventory write-offs of US$75 million (2021: US$18 million) offset by a write-back of previously written down inventory due to an increase in realisable values amounting to US$20 million (2021: US$25 million).\n\nAt 31 December 2022, US$850 million (2021: US$754 million) of inventories were pledged as security for liabilities.\n\n## 17   Receivables and other assets\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe business model for our receivables is primarily 'hold to collect' (where assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows) except those subject to our factoring programme.  For our financial instruments, including receivables, held under a hold to collect business model and which have cash flows that meet the solely payments of principal and interest ('SPPI') criteria these are recognised at amortised cost. Where our receivables do not meet the SPPI criteria, for example our provisionally priced receivables, these are measured at fair value through profit or loss with subsequent fair value gains or losses are taken to the income statement.\n\nA portion of our receivables participate in receivable factoring and letter of credit discounting programmes. We take advantage of these programmes to balance  the impact of extended payment terms requested by our customers with our own working capital objectives or where the acceleration of cash receipts is financially beneficial compared with the cost of borrowing at the operation. We have applied our judgment when considering the business model test as defined in IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and conclude that the business model for receivables under the letter of credit discounting programme has not changed. We continue to hold these receivables at amortised cost because the sale of the letter of credit is made close to maturity of receivables and the discounting costs are immaterial. The business model for receivables subject to the global factoring programme does not meet the 'hold to collect' model and therefore are classified as 'held for sale'. This means the receivables are held at fair value each reporting period with the remeasurements being recorded in the income statement. Where a portion of our factored receivable is subject to recourse, that part of the receivable is not derecognised from the balance sheet and the cash received in advance is classified as a borrowing. The cash flows relating to the borrowing are shown in financing cash flows.  At 31 December 2022 US$457 million (2021: US$504 million) of receivables participated in the global factoring programme and US$430 million (2021: US$418 million) participated in the letter of credit discounting programme.\n\n|                                                                  | Non-current 2022  US$m   | Current 2022  US$m   | Total 2022  US$m   | Non-current 2021 US$m   | Current 2021 US$m   | Total 2021 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Trade receivables (a)                                            | -                        | 2,179                | 2,179              | -                       | 2,241               | 2,241             |\n| Other financial receivables (a)                                  | 124                      | 462                  | 586                | 135                     | 386                 | 521               |\n| Other receivables (b)                                            | 383                      | 382                  | 765                | 392                     | 418                 | 810               |\n| Prepayment of tolling charges to jointly controlled entities (c) | 218                      | -                    | 218                | 183                     | -                   | 183               |\n| Pension surpluses (note 28)                                      | 824                      | -                    | 824                | 1,070                   | -                   | 1,070             |\n| Other prepayments                                                | 344                      | 455                  | 799                | 414                     | 529                 | 943               |\n| Total (d)                                                        | 1,893                    | 3,478                | 5,371              | 2,194                   | 3,574               | 5,768             |\n\n188",

The team establishes credit limits for all of our customers. Where customers are rated by an independent credit rating agency, these ratings are used as a guide to set credit limits. Where there are no independent credit ratings available, we assess the credit quality of the customer through a credit rating model and assign appropriate credit limits. The Commercial team monitors outstanding customer receivables regularly and highlights any credit concerns to senior management. Receivables to high risk customers are often secured by letters of credit or other forms of credit enhancement.\n\nThe expected credit loss on our trade receivable portfolio is insignificant.\n\n## 18   Trade and other payables\n\n|                                        | Non-current 2022  US$m   | Current 2022  US$m   | Total 2022  US$m   | Non-current 2021 US$m Adjusted (b)   | Current 2021 US$m Adjusted (b)   | Total 2021 US$m Adjusted (b)   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Trade payables                         | 3                        | 3,269                | 3,272              | -                                    | 3,410                            | 3,410                          |\n| Other financial payables               | 225                      | 1,083                | 1,308              | 254                                  | 909                              | 1,163                          |\n| Other payables                         | 63                       | 131                  | 194                | 82                                   | 110                              | 192                            |\n| Deferred income (a)(b)                 | 114                      | 333                  | 447                | 205                                  | 404                              | 609                            |\n| Accruals                               | -                        | 1,611                | 1,611              | 42                                   | 1,488                            | 1,530                          |\n| Employee entitlements                  | -                        | 878                  | 878                | -                                    | 798                              | 798                            |\n| Royalties and mining taxes             | 3                        | 644                  | 647                | 2                                    | 574                              | 576                            |\n| Amounts owed to equity accounted units | 196                      | 98                   | 294                | 213                                  | 40                               | 253                            |\n| Total                                  | 604                      | 8,047                | 8,651              | 798                                  | 7,733                            | 8,531                          |\n\nThe fair value of trade payables and financial instruments within other financial payables approximates their carrying value.\n\nThe Group participates in supply chain finance arrangements whereby vendors may elect to receive early payment of their invoice from a third-party bank by factoring their receivable from Rio Tinto. These arrangements do not modify the terms of the original liability with respect to either counterparty terms, settlement date or amount due. Utilisation of the early settlement facility is voluntary and at the vendors' discretion on an invoiceby-invoice basis. Financial liabilities subject to supply chain finance therefore continue to be classified as trade payables with the cash outflows showing in operating cash flows. At 31 December 2022, trade payables included US$819 million (2021: US$782 million) subject to early settlement election by vendors.\n\n189",

Capital is allocated in a consistent and disciplined manner. Essential capital remains our priority for capital allocation. It includes sustaining capital to ensure the integrity of our assets, highreturning replacement projects and decarbonisation investment. This is followed by ordinary dividends within our well-established returns policy. We then test investment in compelling growth projects against debt management and additional cash returns to shareholders.\n\nOur Board and senior management regularly review the capital structure and liquidity of the Group. They take into account our strategic priorities, the economic and business conditions, and any identified investment opportunities, along with the expected returns to shareholders. We expect total cash returns to shareholders over the longer term to be in a range of 40-60% of underlying earnings in aggregate through the commodity cycle.\n\nWe consider various financial metrics when managing our risk, including net debt, gearing, the overall level of borrowings and their maturity profile, liquidity levels, total capital, future cash flows, underlying EBITDA and interest cover ratios.\n\nOur total capital as at 31 December was:\n\n| Total capital                                                              | Note   | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------|-------------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto (see Group balance sheet)       |        | 50,175       | 51,432      |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests (see Group balance sheet) |        | 2,099        | 5,158       |\n| Net debt/(cash)                                                            | 19     | 4,188        | (1,576)     |\n| Total capital                                                              |        | 56,462       | 55,014      |\n\nWe have access to various forms of financing including our US Shelf Programme, European Debt Issuance Programme, Commercial Paper and credit facilities.\n\nIn 2022, we exercised one of our options to extend the maturity of our US$7.5 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility.

When the amount payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period. This will therefore not necessarily agree with the amounts disclosed as the carrying value.\n\n|                                                                 | 2022                            | 2022                       | 2022                         | 2022               | 2022                           | 2021                            | 2021                       | 2021                         | 2021               | 2021                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Financial liability analysis At 31 December  (Outflows)/Inflows | Within 1 year or on demand US$m | Between 1 and 2 years US$m | Between  2 and 5  years US$m | After 5 years US$m | Total US$m                     | Within 1 year or on demand US$m | Between 1 and 2 years US$m | Between  2 and 5  years US$m | After 5 years US$m | Total US$m                      |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities                            |                                 |                            |                              |                    |                                |                                 |                            |                              |                    |                                 |\n| Trade and other financial payables (a)                          | (5,971)                         | (37)                       | (57)                         | (329)              | (6,394)                        | (5,766)                         | (31)                       | (72)                         | (406)              | (6,275)                         |\n| Expected lease liability payments                               | (329)                           | (235)                      | (344)                        | (606)              | (1,514)                        | (361)                           | (266)                      | (400)                        | (704)              | (1,731)                         |\n| Borrowings before swaps                                         | (937)                           | (1,425)                    | (1,839)                      |                    | (7,389)    (11,590)            | (827)                           | (746)                      | (2,519)                      |                    | (8,112)    (12,204)             |\n| Expected future interest payments (a)                           | (668)                           | (603)                      | (1,468)                      | (3,141)            | (5,880)                        | (511)                           | (486)                      | (1,313)                      | (3,485)            | (5,795)                         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                     | -

Our policy is to predominantly borrow in US dollars at floating interest rates, either directly or through the use of derivatives, as:\n\n- -the majority of our sales are in US dollars,\n- -historically a lower cost of borrowing has been observed from maintaining a floating rate exposure\n- -historically there is a correlation between interest rates and commodity prices.\n\nFor bonds with fixed interest rates, we generally enter into interest rate swaps to convert them to floating rates. The tenor of the interest rate swaps is sometimes shorter than the tenor of the bond which means we remain exposed to long-term fixed-rate funding. As interest rate swaps mature, new medium dated swaps are generally transacted to maintain this floating rate exposure; however, we may elect to maintain fixed interest rates in certain circumstances.\n\nWe have designated the swaps to be in fair value hedge relationships with the corresponding period of future interest payments of the respective debt.\n\nWhere we borrow non-US denominated debt, we enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to convert the principal and fixed interest coupon to a US dollar notional with a US dollar interest coupon.\n\nThe characteristics and carrying value of the Group's borrowings are summarised below:\n\n## Borrowings at 31 December\n\n|                                                                                             | Carrying  value 2022 US$m   | Carrying  value 2021 US$m   | Nominal  value of  hedged item 2022 US$m   | Nominal  value of  hedged item 2021 US$m   | Weighted average  interest rate  after swaps (where  applicable)   | Swap  maturity  (where  applicable)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Rio Tinto Finance plc Euro Bonds 2.875% due 2024 (a)(c)                                     | 429                         | 497                         | 546                                        | 546                                        | 3 month LIBOR +1.64%                                               | 2024                                  |\n| Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited Bonds 7.125% 2028 (a)                                       | 807                         | 934                         | 750                                        | 750                                        | 3 month LIBOR +3.27%                                               | 2028                                  |\n| Alcan Inc.

        "page_content": "## Update on interest rate benchmark reform\n\nWe adopted, in prior periods, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (IFRS 9), IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures (IFRS 7), IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) and IFRS 16 Leases (IFRS 16). The amendments address the financial reporting impact from reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates (collectively 'IBOR reform'). We have taken relevant practical reliefs from certain requirements relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and hedge accounting, described below.\n\nOur hedging arrangements impacted by the reform of USD LIBOR are part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Fallbacks Protocol, which provides a global standardised mechanism for replacement of the current benchmark. During the year we transitioned the swaps, which hedge the Alcan Inc. Debentures, from the LIBOR to SOFR interest benchmark rates (refer to the table above) and applied the relief that preserved the existing hedge accounting.  At 31 December 2022, we have interest rate risk exposure including US$4.8 billion nominal values of fixed-rate borrowings swapped to US dollar rates in fair value hedge relationships impacted by the reform. We expect the application of the reliefs to result in continuation of our pre-existing hedge accounting upon amendment of designated arrangements in response to the replacement of USD LIBOR which will occur immediately after 30 June 2023.\n\nIn October 2022, as part of the extension of the term loan facility of Richards Bay Minerals, we transitioned from the LIBOR benchmark to an interest rate based on the SOFR reference rate. Our other arrangements which reference IBOR benchmarks and extend beyond 2022 include: third-party borrowings relating to the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance, shareholder loan facilities and certain commercial contracts. The amendments to IFRS 9 require that we account for a change in the basis for determining the cash flows of a financial asset or a financial liability measured at amortised cost, by updating their respective effective interest rates as required by the IBOR reform. As a result of the applicable IFRS 9 reliefs, we expect that no material gain or loss will arise from these updates. The accessible revolving lines of credit, which have been extended for a further one year in 2022, now refer to the SOFR and SONIA benchmark rates.\n\n## 21   Leases\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nIFRS 16 'Leases' applies to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. Certain leases are exempt from the standard, including leases to explore for or use minerals, oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative resources. We apply the scope exemptions in paragraphs 3(e) and 4 of IFRS 16 and do not apply IFRS 16 to leases of any assets which would otherwise fall within the scope of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'.\n\nA significant proportion by value of our lease arrangements relate to dry bulk vessels and office properties. Other leases include land and non-mining rights, warehouses, ports, equipment and vehicles.\n\nWe recognise all lease liabilities and corresponding right of use assets on balance sheet, with the exception of short-term (12 months or fewer) and low value leases, where payments are expensed as incurred. Lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of: fixed payments; variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate; amounts payable under residual value guarantees; and extension options expected to be exercised. Where a lease contains an extension option which we can exercise without negotiation, lease payments for the extension period are included in the liability if we are reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from the calculation of lease liabilities at initial recognition. Payments are discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease can be readily determined. For lease agreements relating to vessels, ports and properties, non-lease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and recorded separately within operating costs as services are being provided. The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The right of use asset arising from a lease arrangement at initial recognition reflects the lease liability, initial direct costs, lease payments made before the commencement date of the lease, and capitalised provision for dismantling and restoration, less any lease incentives.\n\nWe recognise depreciation on right of use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the income statement over the lease term. Repayments of lease liabilities are separated into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and an interest portion (which the Group presents in operating activities) in the cash flow statement. Payments made before the commencement date are included within financing activities unless they in substance represent investing cash flows, for example where pre-commencement cash flows are significant relative to aggregate cash flows of the leasing arrangement.\n\n## Lessee arrangements\n\nWe have made the following payments associated with leases:\n\n| Description of payment                                 |   2022 US$m | 2021 US$m Included within                |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Principal lease payments                               |         374 | 358 Cash flows from financing activities |\n| Interest payments on leases                            |          47 | 48 Cash flows from operating activities  |\n| Payments for short-term leases                         |         465 | 502 Net operating costs                  |\n| Payments for variable lease components                 |          50 | 34 Net operating costs                   |\n| Payments for low value leases (>12 months in duration) |           1 | 2 Net operating costs                    |\n| Total lease payments                                   |         937 | 944                                      |\n\n193",

Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities on the balance sheet. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of overdrafts.\n\n|                                                                              | 2022  US$m   |     | 2021 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----|-------------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                                     | 1,889        |     | 1,344       |\n| Money market funds, reverse repurchase agreements and other cash equivalents | 4,886        |     | 11,463      |\n| Balance per Group balance sheet                                              | 6,775        |     | 12,807      |\n| Bank overdrafts repayable on demand (unsecured)                              | 20           | (1) | (2)         |\n| Balance per Group cash flow statement                                        | 6,774        |     | 12,805      |\n\n## Restricted cash and cash equivalent analysis\n\nCash and cash equivalents of US$391 million (2021: US$235 million) are held in countries where there are restrictions on remittances. Of this balance, US$268 million (2021: US$165 million) could be used to repay subsidiaries' third-party borrowings.\n\nThere are also restrictions on a further US$576 million (2021: US$981 million) of cash and cash equivalents, the majority of which is held by partially owned subsidiaries and is not available for use in the wider Group due to legal and contractual restrictions currently in place. Of this balance US$336 million (2021: US$752 million) could be used to repay these subsidiaries' third-party borrowings.\n\n## Credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents\n\nOur Treasury team manages credit risk from our investing activities in accordance with credit risk framework which sets the risk appetite. We make investments of surplus funds only with approved investment grade (BBB- and above) counterparties who have been assigned specific credit limits. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of credit risk and therefore mitigate the potential for financial loss through counterparty failure.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 we held US$850 million (2021: US$4,520 million) of reverse repurchase agreements, measured at amortised cost and reported within cash and cash equivalents as they are highly liquid products maturing within three months. We accepted collateral of investment grade quality in respect of these reverse repurchase agreements, with a fair value of US$892 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: US$4,638 million). Collateral is not recognised on our balance sheet and if the counterparty were to default we would be able to sell it.\n\n194",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2022 financial statements\n\n## 24   Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## Financial risk management objectives\n\nOur financial risk management objectives are:\n\n- -to have in place a robust capital structure to manage the organisation through the commodity cycle; and\n- -to allow our financial exposures, mainly commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rates, to, in general, float with the market.\n\nOur Treasury and Commercial teams manage the following key economic risks generated from our operations:\n\n- -Capital and Liquidity risk\n- -Credit risk\n- -Interest rate risk\n- -Commodity price risk\n- -Foreign exchange risk\n\nThese teams operate under a strong control environment, within approved limits.\n\n## (i) Capital and liquidity risk\n\nOur capital and liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may not be able to settle or meet our obligations as they fall due. Refer to Our capital and liquidity section on page 190.\n\n## (ii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that our customers, or institutions that we invest in, are unable to meet their contractual obligations. We are exposed to credit risk in our operating activities (primarily from customer trade receivables); and from our investing activities that include government securities (primarily US Government), corporate and asset-backed securities, reverse re-purchase agreements, money market funds, and balances with banks and financial institutions. Refer to note 17 Receivables and other assets, note 22 Cash and cash equivalents and note 23 Other financial assets and liabilities for an understanding of the size of balance.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nOur interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating interest rates. After the impact of hedging, 77% (2021: 85%) of our borrowings (including leases) were at floating rates. To understand how we manage interest rate risk refer to note 20.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate changes\n\nBased on our floating rate financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2022, the effect on our net earnings of a 100 basis point increase in US dollar LIBOR or SOFR (where applicable) interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would be an expense of US$26 million (2021: income of US$13 million). This reflects the net debt position in 2022 compared to a net cash position in prior year.\n\nWe are also exposed to interest rate volatility within shareholders' equity. This is because we have designated some cross currency interest rate swaps to be in a cash flow hedge relationship with our 2029 GBP loan. As we receive fixed GBP interest and pay fixed USD interest any change in the GBP interest rate or the USD interest rate will have an impact on the fair value of the derivative within shareholders' equity. With all factors remaining constant, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates in each of the currencies in isolation would impact equity, before tax, by a charge of US$35 million (2021: US$55 million charge) for sterling and a credit of US$48 million (2021: US$65 million credit) for US dollars. A 100 basis point decrease would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.\n\n## (iv) Commodity price risk\n\nOur broad commodity base means our exposure to commodity prices is diversified.  Our normal policy is to sell our products at prevailing market prices. For certain physical commodity transactions for which the price was fixed at the contract date, we enter into derivatives to achieve the prevailing market prices at the point of revenue recognition. We do not generally consider that using derivatives to fix commodity prices would provide a long-term benefit to our shareholders.\n\nExceptions to this rule are subject to limits, and to defined market risk tolerances and internal controls.\n\nSubstantially all iron ore and aluminium sales are reflected at final prices at each reporting period. Final prices for copper concentrate, however, are normally determined between 30 and 180 days after delivery to our customer.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, we had 83 million pounds of copper sales (31 December 2021: 81 million pounds), that were provisionally priced at US 380 cents per pound (2021: US 440 cents per pound). The final price of these sales will be determined during the first half of 2023. A 10% change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, all other factors held constant, would increase or reduce net earnings by US$19 million (2021: US$26 million).\n\nPower costs represent a significant portion of costs in our aluminium business and therefore we are exposed to fluctuations in power prices.\n\nTo mitigate our exposure to changes in the relationship between aluminium prices and power prices, we have a number of electricity purchase contracts which are directly linked to the daily official LME cash ask price for high grade aluminium ('LME price') and to the US Midwest Transaction Premium ('Midwest premium').\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, we apply hedge accounting to two embedded derivatives within our power contracts. The embedded derivatives (notional aluminium forward sales) have been designated as the hedging instrument. The forecast aluminium sales, priced using the LME price and the Midwest premium, represent the hedged item.\n\nThe hedging ratio is 1:1, as the quantity of sales designated as being hedged matches the notional amount of the hedging instrument. The hedging instrument's notional amount, expressed in equivalent metric tonnes of aluminium, is derived from our expected electricity consumption under the power contracts as well as other relevant contract parameters.\n\n196",

The amount that is recognised in other comprehensive income is limited to the lesser of the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item, in absolute terms. On realisation of the hedges, realised amounts are reclassified from reserves to consolidated sales revenue in the income statement.\n\nWe recognise any ineffectiveness relating to the hedging relationship immediately in the income statement.\n\nSources of ineffectiveness include: differences in the timing of the cash flows between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, non-zero initial fair value of the hedging instrument, the existence of a cap on the Midwest premium in the hedging instrument and counterparty credit risk.\n\nWe held the following notional aluminium forward sales contracts embedded in the power contracts:\n\n| At 31 December 2022                    | Total   | Within 1 year   | Between 1 and  5 years   | Between 5 and  10 years   | After 10 years   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Notional amount (in tonnes)            | 501,498 | 72,812          | 289,868                  | 138,818                   | -                |\n| Notional amount (in US$ millions)      | 1,216   | 166             | 697                      | 353                       | -                |\n| Average hedged rate (in US$ per tonne) | 2,425   | 2,282           | 2,404                    | 2,542                     | -                |\n\nBetween 1\n\nand 5 years\n\nBetween 5\n\nand 10 years\n\nAfter 10 years",

The majority of our sales are denominated in the US dollar.\n\nOur operating costs are influenced by the currencies of those countries where our mines and processing plants are located, and by those currencies in which we buy imported equipment and services. The US dollar, the Australian dollar and the Canadian dollar are the most important currencies influencing our costs. In any particular year, currency fluctuations may have a significant impact on our financial results. A strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies in which our costs are partly denominated has a positive effect on our underlying earnings. However, a strengthening of the US dollar reduces the value of non-US dollar denominated net assets, and therefore total equity.\n\nIn most cases our debt and other financial assets and liabilities, including intragroup balances, is held in the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. There are instances where these balances are held in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. This means we recognise exchange gains and losses in our income statement (except where they can be taken to equity) as these balances are translated into the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. Our income statement also includes exchange gains and losses arising on US dollar net debt and intragroup balances. On consolidation, these balances are retranslated to our US dollar presentation currency and there is a corresponding and offsetting exchange difference recognised directly in the currency translation reserve. There is no impact on total equity.\n\nUnder normal market conditions, we do not consider that active currency hedging of transactions would provide long-term benefits to shareholders. We review our exposure on a regular basis and will undertake hedging if deemed appropriate. We may deem currency protection measures appropriate in specific commercial circumstances. Capital expenditures and other significant financial items such as acquisitions, disposals, tax and dividend cash flows may be economically hedged.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe table below shows the estimated retranslation effect on financial assets and financial liabilities, including intragroup balances, of a 10% strengthening in the closing exchange rate of the US dollar against significant currencies. We deem 10% to be the annual exchange rate movement that is reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run) for any of our significant currencies and therefore an appropriate representation.\n\n## At 31 December 2022\n\nLosses associated with 10% strengthening of the US dollar\n\n| Currency exposure   |   Closing exchange rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m   | Impact  directly on equity US$m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Australian dollar   |                               68 | (319)                         | (986)                             |\n| Canadian dollar     |                               74 | (219)                         | -                                 |\n\n## At 31 December 2021\n\n## Gains/(losses) associated with 10% strengthening of the US dollar\n\n| Currency exposure   |   Closing exchange rate US cents | Effect on net earnings US$m   | Impact directly on equity US$m   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Australian dollar   |                               73 | 379                           | (1,044)                          |\n| Canadian dollar     |                               78 | (111)                         | -                                |\n\nWe calculate sensitivities in relation to the functional currencies of our individual entities. We translate the impact of these on net earnings into US dollars at the exchange rates on which the sensitivities are based. The impact to net earnings associated with a 10% weakening of a particular currency, shown above, is broadly offset within equity through movements in the currency translation reserve and therefore generally has no impact on our net assets. The offsetting currency translation movement is not shown in the table above. The impact is expressed in terms of the effect on net earnings and equity, assuming that each exchange rate moves in isolation. The sensitivities are based on financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 December 2022, where balances are not denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary or joint operation, and exclude financial assets and liabilities held by equity accounted units. These balances will not remain constant throughout 2023, and therefore the  information should be used with care.\n\n198",

Changing the level 3 inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fair value significantly, taking into account the expected remaining term of contracts for either reported period. The fair value of these derivatives is a net liability of US$208 million at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$146 million).\n\n## Impact of climate change on our business - Coal royalty receivables\n\nRoyalty receivables include amounts arising from our divested coal businesses with a carrying value of US$209 million (31 December 2021: US$136 million). These are classified as 'Other investments, including loans' within note 23. The fair values are determined using level 3 unobservable inputs. These royalty receivables include US$81 million from forecast production beyond 2030. These have not been adjusted for potential changes in production rates that could occur due to climate change targets impacting the operator.\n\nThe main unobservable input is the long-term coal price used over the life of these royalty receivables. A 15% increase in the coal spot price would result in a US$68 million increase (31 December 2021: US$63 million increase) in the carrying value. A 15% decrease in the coal spot price would result in a US$18 million decrease (31 December 2021: US$53 million decrease) in the carrying value. We have used a 15% assumption to calculate our exposure as it represents the annual coal price movement that we deem to be reasonably probable (on an annual basis over the long run).\n\n## Fair values disclosure of financial instruments\n\nThe following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of our borrowings including those which are not carried at an amount which approximates their fair value at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021. The fair values of our remaining financial instruments approximate their carrying values because of their short maturity, or because they carry floating rates of interest.\n\n|                                   | 31 December 2022    | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021    | 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n|                                   | Carrying value US$m | Fair value US$m    | Carrying value US$m | Fair value US$m    |\n| Borrowings (including overdrafts) | 11,071              | 11,192             | 12,168              | 13,904             |\n\nTotal borrowings with a carrying value of US$6.6 billion (31 December 2021: US$7.3 billion) relate to listed bonds with a fair value of US$6.6 billion (31 December 2021: US$8.7 billion) and are categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Borrowings with a carrying value of US$3.8 billion (31 December 2021: US$4.2 billion) relate to project finance drawn down by Oyu Tolgoi, with a fair value of US$3.9 billion (31 December 2021: US$4.4 billion) using a number of  level 3 valuation inputs. Our remaining borrowings have a fair value measured by discounting estimated cash flows with an applicable market quoted yield, and are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n200",

The awards are settled in equity.\n\n## Equity Incentive Plan\n\nSince 2018, all long-term incentive awards have been granted under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan which allows for awards in the form of Performance Share Awards (PSA), Management Share Awards (MSA) and Bonus Deferral Awards (BDA) to be granted. In general, these awards will be settled in equity, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting and therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.\n\n## Performance Share Awards (Performance Share Plans prior to 2018)\n\nParticipants are generally assigned shares in settlement of their PSA on vesting. Therefore the awards are accounted for in accordance with the requirements applying to equity-settled share-based payment transactions, including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting.\n\nFor the parts of awards with Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance conditions, the fair value of the awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the TSR performance conditions. One-third of the awards granted up to 2017 (inclusive) are subject to an earnings margin performance target relative to ten global mining comparators. As a non-market related performance condition, the  fair value recognised is reviewed at each accounting date based on the prevailing expected outcome. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 5% per annum).\n\nFor grants made from 2018, the earnings margin performance target applying to the PSA was removed. Since 2018, only  the TSR performance conditions set out in the Remuneration Report apply to the PSA.\n\n## Management Share Awards\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent on service conditions being met; no performance conditions apply.\n\nThe fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 7% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 7% per annum).\n\n202\n\n## Bonus Deferral Awards\n\nBDAs provide for the mandatory deferral of 50% of the bonuses for executive directors and Executive Committee members .\n\nThe vesting of these awards is dependent only on service conditions being met. The fair value of each award on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the day of grant. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 3% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 3% per annum).\n\n## Global Employee Share Plans\n\nThe Global Employee Share Plans were introduced in 2012 and reapproved by shareholders in 2021. Under these Plans, the companies provide a matching share award for each investment share purchased by a participant. The vesting of matching awards is dependent on service conditions being met and the continued holding of investment shares by the participant until vesting. These awards are settled in equity including the dividends accumulated from date of award to vesting. The fair value of each matching share on the day of grant is equal to the share price on the date of purchase less a deduction of 15% for estimated cancellations (caused by employees withdrawing their investment shares prior to vesting. Forfeitures prior to vesting are assumed at 5% per annum of outstanding awards (2021: 5% per annum).\n\nThe PSA, MSA, BDA and awards under the Global Employee Share Plans and UK Share Plan together represent 100% (2021: 100%) of the total IFRS 2 charge for Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited plans in 2022.\n\n## Recognition and measurement:\n\nThese plans are accounted for in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment'.\n\nThe fair value of the Group's share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period with an offset to retained earnings for Rio Tinto plc plans and to other reserves for Rio Tinto Limited plans.\n\nThe Group uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\n\nThe terms of each plan are considered at the balance sheet date to determine whether the plan should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled. The Group does not operate any material plans as cash-settled although certain awards can be settled in cash at the discretion of the directors or where settling awards in equity is challenging or prohibited by local laws and regulations. The value of these awards is immaterial.\n\nThe Group's equity-settled share plans are settled either by: the issuance of shares by the relevant parent company; the purchase of shares on market; or the use of shares held in treasury. If the cost of shares acquired to satisfy the plans differs from the expense charged, the difference is taken to retained earnings or other reserves, as appropriate.",

The total liability for these awards at 31 December 2022 was US$5 million (2021: US$4 million).\n\n## 28  Post-retirement benefits\n\n## Description of plans\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement healthcare plans which provide lump sums, pensions, medical benefits and life insurance to retirees.  Some of these plans are defined contribution and some are defined benefit, with assets held in separate trusts, foundations and similar entities.\n\nDefined benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare plans expose the Group to a number of risks:\n\n| Uncertainty in benefit  payments   | The value of the Group's liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will depend on the level of future pay increases, the level of inflation (for those benefits that are subject to some form of  inflation protection) and how long individuals live.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Volatility in asset values         | The Group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in pension plans to meet future benefit payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Uncertainty in cash funding        | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the Group being required to provide higher levels of cash funding,  although changes in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In some countries control over the rate of  cash funding or over the investment policy for pension assets might rest to some extent with a trustee body or other body that is not  under the Group's direct control. In addition the Group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation. |\n\nFor these reasons the Group has a policy of moving away from defined benefit pension provisions and towards defined contribution arrangements instead. The defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are closed to new entrants in almost all countries. For unionised employees, some plans remain open.\n\nThe Group does not usually participate in multi-employer plans in which the risks are shared with other companies using those plans. The Group's participation in such plans is immaterial and therefore no detailed disclosures are provided in this note.\n\n## Pension plans\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit pension obligations are in Canada, the UK, the US and Switzerland.\n\nIn Canada the benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay and the plans are generally closed to new entrants. Benefits for unionised employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically linked either to final average pay or to a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees join arrangements which are defined contribution from the Group's perspective, with any required additional funding being provided by employees. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to Canadian pension plans in the relevant provinces and territories (predominantly Quebec). Pension Committees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with the relevant regulations. The Pension Committees generally have a number of members appointed by the sponsor and a number appointed by the plan participants. In some cases, there is also an independent Committee member.\n\nThe defined benefit sections of the UK arrangements are linked to final pay. New employees join the defined contribution sections. The plans are subject to the regulatory requirements that apply to UK pension plans. Trustees are responsible for ensuring that the plans operate in a manner that is compliant with UK regulations. The trustee board governing the main UK plans has a number of directors appointed by the sponsor, a number appointed by the plan participants and an independent trustee director.\n\nA defined benefit pension plan is sponsored by the US entities. Benefits for salaried staff are generally linked to final average pay. Benefits for unionised employees are reviewed in negotiation with unions and are typically a flat monetary amount per year of service. New employees are admitted to defined contribution plans. A Benefits Governance Committee is responsible for ensuring that the plans are compliant with US regulations. Members of that Committee are appointed by the sponsor.\n\nThe Swiss plan provides benefits linked to final average pay. The Swiss plan is overseen by a Trustee board which is responsible for ensuring that the plan complies with Swiss regulations. Trustee board members are appointed by the plan sponsor, by employees and by retirees.\n\n204",

        "page_content": "In Australia, the main arrangements are principally defined contribution in nature but there are sections providing defined benefits linked to final pay, typically paid in lump sum form. These arrangements are managed by an independent financial institution, who are responsible for ensuring that the plans are operating in a manner that is compliant with local regulations. We may nominate candidates to be considered for appointment to the governing board, as may other employers. One third of the board positions are nominated by employers, with the remaining positions being filled by independent directors and directors nominated by participants.\n\nThe Group also operates a number of unfunded defined benefit plans, which are included in the figures below.\n\n## Post-retirement healthcare plans\n\nCertain subsidiaries of the Group, mainly in the US and Canada, provide healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees and in some cases to their beneficiaries and covered dependants. Eligibility for coverage is dependent upon certain age and service criteria. These arrangements are unfunded, and are included in the figures below.\n\n## Recognition and measurement:\n\nFor post-employment defined benefit schemes, in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', local actuaries calculate the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the plan obligations using a variety of valuation techniques dependent on the type of asset or liability. The difference is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.\n\nWhere appropriate, the recognition of assets may be restricted to the present value of any amounts the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions. In determining the extent to which a refund will be available the Group considers whether any third party, such as a trustee or pension committee, has the power to enhance benefits or to wind up a pension plan without the Group's consent.\n\nThe current service cost, any past service cost and the effect of any curtailment or settlements are recognised in the income statement. The interest cost less interest income on assets held in the plans is also charged to the income statement. All amounts charged to the income statement in respect of these plans are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate. Actuarial gains/ losses and returns from assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. These are included within 'Net operating costs' or in 'Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units', as appropriate.\n\n## Plan assets\n\nThe assets of the pension plans are invested predominantly in a diversified range of equities, bonds and property. Consequently, the funding level of the pension plans is affected by movements in the level of equity markets and also by movements in interest rates. The Group monitors its exposure to changes in interest rates and equity markets and also measures its balance sheet pension risk using a value at risk approach. These measures are considered when deciding whether significant changes in investment strategy are required.\n\nInvestment strategy reviews are conducted on a periodic basis to determine the optimal investment mix. This is performed while bearing in mind the risk tolerance of the Group and local sponsor companies, and the views of the Pension Committees and trustee boards who are legally responsible for the plans' investments. The assets of the pension plans may also be invested in Qualifying Insurance Policies which provide a stream of payments to match the benefits being paid out by the plans. This would therefore remove the investment, inflation and longevity risks.\n\nIn Canada, the UK and Switzerland, the Group works with the governing bodies to ensure that the investment policy adopted is consistent with the Group's tolerance for risk. In the US the Group has direct control over the investment policy, subject to local investment regulations.\n\nThe proportions of the total fair value of assets in the pension plans for each asset class at the balance sheet date were:\n\n|                                       | 2022   | 2022   | 2021   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Equities                              | 18.0%  |        | 17.6%  |        |\n| - Quoted                              |        | 12.3%  |        | 13.4%  |\n| - Private                             |        | 5.7%   |        | 4.2%   |\n| Bonds                                 | 58.1%  |        | 60.2%  |        |\n| - Government fixed income             |        | 24.6%  |        | 23.2%  |\n| - Government inflation-linked         |        | 5.0%   |        | 9.5%   |\n| - Corporate and other publicly quoted |        | 19.6%  |        | 20.6%  |\n| - Private                             |        | 8.9%   |        | 6.9%   |\n| Property                              | 10.0%  |        | 7.9%   |        |\n| - Quoted property funds               |        | 2.9%   |        | 3.4%   |\n| - Unquoted property funds             |        | 7.1%   |        | 4.5%   |\n| Qualifying insurance policies         | 9.7%   |        | 10.5%  |        |\n| Cash & other                          | 4.2%   |        | 3.8%   |        |\n| Total                                 | 100.0% |        | 100.0% |        |\n\nThe assets of the plans are managed on a day-to-day basis by external specialist fund managers. These managers may invest in the Group's securities subject to limits imposed by the relevant fiduciary committees and local legislation. The approximate total holding of Group securities within the plans is US$2 million (2021: US$2 million).\n\nThe holdings of quoted equities are invested in either pooled funds or segregated accounts held in the name of the relevant pension funds. These equity portfolios are well diversified in terms of the geographic distribution and market sectors.\n\n205",

Corporate and other quoted bonds are usually of investment grade. Private debt is mainly held in the North American and UK pension funds and is invested in North American and European companies.\n\nThe property funds are invested in a diversified range of properties.\n\nThe holdings of cash & other are predominantly cash and short-term money market instruments.\n\nInvestments in private equity, private debt and property are less liquid than the other investment classes listed above and therefore the Group's investment in those asset classes is restricted to a level that does not endanger the liquidity of the pension plans.\n\nQualifying insurance policies are held with insurance companies that are regulated by the relevant local authorities. The value of those policies is calculated by the local actuaries using assumptions consistent with those adopted for valuing the insured obligations.\n\nThe Group makes limited use of futures, repurchase agreements and other instruments to manage the interest rate risk in some of its plans. Fund managers may also use derivatives to hedge currency movements within their portfolios and, in the case of bond managers, to take positions that could be taken using direct holdings of bonds but more efficiently. Exposure to these instruments is closely monitored and maintained at a level that does not endanger the liquidity of any pension plan.\n\n## Maturity of defined benefit obligations\n\nAn approximate analysis of the maturity of the obligations is given in the table below:\n\n|                                                         | Pension benefits   | Other benefits   | 2022 Total   | 2021 Total   | 2020 Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Proportion relating to current employees                | 1 9   %            | 1 6   %          | 1 8   %      | 2 0   %      | 2 1   %      |\n| Proportion relating to former employees not yet retired | 9   %              | 0   %            | 9   %        | 11 %         | 11 %         |\n| Proportion relating to retirees                         | 7 2   %            | 8 4   %          | 73 %         | 69 %         | 6 8   %      |\n| Total                                                   | 100 %              | 100 %            | 100 %        | 100 %        | 100 %        |\n| Average duration of obligations (years)                 | 11.4               | 11.3             | 11.4         | 13.8         | 14.3         |\n\nMost of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are closed to new entrants, therefore the carrying value of the Group's post-employment obligations is  less sensitive to assumptions about future salary increases than to other assumptions such as future inflation.\n\n## Geographical distribution of defined benefit obligations\n\nAn approximate analysis of the geographic distribution of the obligations is given in the table below:\n\n|             | Pension benefits   | Other benefits   | 2022 Total   | 2021 Total   | 2020 Total   |\n|-------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Canada      | 59 %               | 4 8   %          | 5 8   %      | 55 %         | 5 3   %      |\n| UK          | 25 %               | 1   %            | 24 %         | 2 8   %      | 2 8   %      |\n| US          | 8   %              | 4 8   %          | 10 %         | 10 %         | 10 %         |\n| Switzerland | 6   %              | 0   %            | 6   %        | 5   %        | 5   %        |\n| Other       | 2   %              | 3   %            | 2   %        | 2   %        | 4   %        |\n| Total       | 100 %              | 100 %            | 100 %        | 100 %        | 100 %        |\n\n## Total expense recognised in the income statement\n\n|                                                                                | Pension benefits US$m   | Other benefits US$m   | 2022 Total US$m   | 2021 Total US$m   | 2020 Total US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Current employer service cost for defined benefit plans                        | (136)                   | (7)                   | (143)             | (167)             | (137)             |\n| Past service cost                                                              | -                       | -                     | -                 | (2)               | (2)               |\n| Settlement losses                                                              | -                       | -                     | -                 | (3)               | (1)               |\n| Net interest on net defined benefit liability                                  | (12)                    | (24)                  | (36)              | (52)              | (49)              |\n| Non-investment expenses paid from the plans                                    | (13)                    | -                     | (13)              | (15)              | (16)              |\n| Total defined benefit expense                                                  | (161)                   | (31)                  | (192)             | (239)             | (205)             |\n| Current employer service cost for defined contribution and industry-wide plans | (365)                   | (2)                   | (367)             | (315)             | (264)             |\n| Total expense recognised in the income statement                               | (526)                   | (33)                  | (559)             | (554)             | (469)             |\n\nThe above expense amounts are included as an employee cost within net operating costs. No amounts have been excluded from underlying earnings in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\n\nThe settlement loss in 2021 resulted from pension obligations in France being transferred to an external insurance company. A past service cost of US$1 million was recognised in 2020 in relation to the Lloyds Banking Group court judgment addressing the need to equalise historical transfer values in relation to Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.\n\n206",

See note 26.\n\n## Funding policy and contributions to plans\n\nThe Group reviews the funding position of its pension plans on a regular basis and considers whether to provide funding above the minimum level required in each country. In Canada and the US the minimum level is prescribed by legislation. In the UK and Switzerland the minimum level is negotiated with the local trustee in accordance with the funding guidance issued by the local regulators. In deciding whether to provide funding above the minimum level, we consider other possible uses of cash elsewhere, the local sponsoring entity's tax situation and any strategic advantage we might obtain. The Group does not generally pre-fund post-retirement healthcare arrangements.\n\n|                                             |   Pension benefits US$m |   Other benefits US$m |   2022 Total US$m |   2021 Total US$m |   2020 Total US$m |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Contributions to defined benefit plans      |                     171 |                    40 |               211 |               464 |               201 |\n| Contributions to defined contribution plans |                     361 |                     2 |               363 |               311 |               261 |\n| Total                                       |                     532 |                    42 |               574 |               775 |               462 |\n\nThe level of surplus in the Rio Tinto Pension Fund in the UK is such that it may be used to pay for the employer contributions to the defined contribution section of that Fund, in accordance with the funding arrangements agreed with the Trustee of that Fund. Consequently, the cash paid to defined contribution plans is lower than the defined contribution service cost by US$4 million. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans are kept under regular review and actual contributions will be determined in line with the Group's wider financing strategy, taking into account relevant minimum funding requirements. In 2021 additional cash of US$294 million was paid in order to settle pension obligations in France. This amount was paid to an external insurer, along with the transfer of existing pension assets in order to transfer the obligations to that insurer. As contributions to many plans are reviewed on at least an annual basis, the contributions for 2023 and subsequent years cannot be determined precisely in advance. Most of the Group's largest pension funds are fully funded on their local funding basis and do not require long-term funding commitments at present. Contributions to defined benefit pension plans for 2023 are estimated to be around US$190 million but may be higher or lower than this depending on the evolution of financial markets and voluntary funding decisions taken by the Group. Contributions for subsequent years are expected to be at similar levels. Healthcare plans are generally unfunded and contributions for future years will be equal to benefit payments net of participant contributions. The Group's contributions in 2023 are expected to be similar to the amounts paid in 2022.\n\n207",

The settlement amounts shown above for 2021 relate to France, where assets and obligations for pensions in payment were transferred to an insurance company.\n\nThe resulting effect of applying an asset ceiling is a loss of US$1 million during the year. In determining the extent to which the asset ceiling has an effect, the Group considers the funding legislation in each country and the rules specific to each pension plan. The calculation takes into account any minimum funding requirements that may be applicable to the plan, whether any reduction in future Group contributions is available, and whether a refund of surplus may be available. In considering whether any refund of surplus is available, the Group considers the powers of trustee boards and similar bodies to augment benefits or wind up a plan. Where such powers are unilateral, the Group does not consider a refund to be available at the end of the life of a plan. Where the plan rules and legislation both permit the employer to take a refund of surplus, the asset ceiling may have no effect, although it may be the case that a refund will only be available many years in the future.\n\n208\n\n2021\n\nTotal\n\nUS$m",

        "page_content": "## Main assumptions (rates per annum)\n\n## Key estimate - Estimation of obligations for post-employment costs\n\nThe value of the Group's obligations for post-employment benefits is dependent on the amount of benefits that are expected to be paid out, discounted to the balance sheet date. The most significant assumptions used in accounting for pension plans are:\n\nThe discount rate - used to determine the net present value of the obligations, the interest cost on the obligations and the interest income on plan assets. We use the yield from high-quality corporate bonds with maturities and terms that match those of the post-employment obligations as closely as possible. Where there is no developed corporate bond market in a currency, the rate on government bonds is used.\n\nThe long-term inflation rate - used to project increases in future benefit payments for those plans that have benefits linked to inflation. The assumption regarding future inflation is based on market yields on inflation linked instruments, where possible, combined with consensus views.\n\nThe mortality rates - used to project the period over which benefits will be paid, which is then discounted to arrive at the net present value of the obligations. The Group reviews the actual mortality rates of retirees in its major pension plans on a regular basis and uses these rates to set its current mortality assumptions. It also uses its judgment with respect to allowances for future improvements in longevity having regard to standard improvement scales in each relevant country and after taking external actuarial advice.\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions used for the valuation at year end are summarised below:\n\n|                              | Canada   | UK   | US   | Switzerland   |\n|------------------------------|----------|------|------|---------------|\n| At 31 December 2022          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 5.0%     | 4.9% | 5.3% | 2.3%          |\n| Long-term inflation (a)      | 2.1%     | 3.3% | 2.4% | 1.2%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.5%     | 2.8% | -%   | 3.4%          |\n| At 31 December 2021          |          |      |      |               |\n| Discount rate                | 2.9%     | 1.9% | 2.8% | 0.3%          |\n| Long-term inflation (a)      | 1.9%     | 3.4% | 2.4% | 0.9%          |\n| Rate of increase in pensions | 0.3%     | 2.9% | - %  | 1.8%          |\n\nThe main financial assumptions used for the healthcare plans, which are predominantly in the US and Canada, were: discount rate: 5.4% (2021: 3.1%); medical trend rate: 7.1% reducing to 4.8% by the year 2031 broadly on a straight line basis (2021: 6.3%, reducing to 4.7% by the year 2031); claims costs based on individual company experience.\n\nFor both the pension and healthcare arrangements, the post-retirement mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in longevity. The mortality tables used imply that a man aged 60 at the balance sheet date has a weighted average expected future lifetime of 27 years (2021: 27 years) and that a man aged 60 in 2041 would have a weighted average expected future lifetime of 28 years (2021: 28 years). The mortality tables are generally based upon the latest standard tables published in each country, adjusted appropriately to reflect the actual mortality experience of the plan participants where credible data is available. Adjustments have been made to some of our plans within the demographic assumptions for the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic based on the 2021 and 2020 experience.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nThe values reported for the defined benefit obligations are sensitive to the actuarial assumptions used for projecting future benefit payments and discounting those payments. In order to estimate the sensitivity of the obligations to changes in assumptions, we calculate what the obligations would be if we were to make changes to each of the key assumptions in isolation. The difference between this figure and the figure calculated using our stated assumptions is an indication of the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in each assumption. The results of this sensitivity analysis are summarised in the table below. Note that this approach is valid for small changes in the assumptions but will be less accurate for larger changes in the assumptions. The sensitivity to inflation includes the impact on pension increases, which are generally linked to inflation where they are granted.\n\n|                                                               |                                                                                           | Approximate (increase)/   | Approximate (increase)/   | 2021 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations   | 2021 Approximate (increase)/ decrease in obligations   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assumption                                                    | Change in assumption                                                                      | Pensions US$m             | Other US$m                | Pensions US$m                                          | Other US$m                                             |\n| Discount rate                                                 | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 483                       | 32                        | 854                                                    | 51                                                     |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (510)                     | (34)                      | (915)                                                  | (55)                                                   |\n| Long-term inflation                                           | Increase of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | (174)                     | (10)                      | (393)                                                  | (14)                                                   |\n|                                                               | Decrease of 0.5 percentage points                                                         | 168                       | 9                         | 374                                                    | 13                                                     |\n| Demographic - allowance for future  improvements in longevity | Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of individuals  who are one year older   | 241                       | 8                         | 441                                                    | 15                                                     |\n|                                                               | Participants assumed to have the mortality rates of individuals  who are one year younger | (241)                     | (8)                       | (441)                                                  | (15)                                                   |\n\n209",

        "page_content": "## Oyu Tolgoi: approval for commencement of underground operations\n\nOn 25 January 2022, Rio Tinto, Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (Turquoise Hill) and the Government of Mongolia announced their agreement, and unanimous approval by the Board of Oyu Tolgoi, to commence the underground operations.\n\nAs part of a comprehensive project budget and funding package undertaken between the parties in reaching this agreement, Turquoise Hill agreed to waive in full, funding balances arising from a carry account loan with Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi (Erdenes) of US$2.4 billion. This comprised the amount of common share investments in Oyu Tolgoi LLC funded by Turquoise Hill on behalf of Erdenes to build the project to date, plus US$1.0 billion of accrued interest. The waiver took effect on 25 January 2022. Rio Tinto and Turquoise Hill also agreed a plan to deliver the funding required until sustainable underground production is reached.\n\nPrior to the waiver agreement, the funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill were expected to be repaid via a pledge over Erdenes' share of future Oyu Tolgoi common share dividends. For this reason, and because the arrangement was between Turquoise Hill and Erdenes rather than with Oyu Tolgoi LLC itself, both the principal and interest were treated as transactions with owners acting in their capacity as owners. Consequently, at 31 December 2021, related amounts were recorded as a reduction in the share of equity attributable to non-controlling interests, resulting in an increase to the effective interest in Oyu Tolgoi attributable to owners of Rio Tinto.\n\nFunding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill were not classified as loan receivables in the Group Balance Sheet, and there was no interest income shown in the Group Income Statement. Accumulation of interest on the funding balances increased the share of retained earnings attributable to Rio Tinto as it accrued.\n\nWaiving the funding balances owing from Erdenes to Turquoise Hill increases Erdenes' economic share arising through entitlement to cash flows from future dividends of Oyu Tolgoi. In the 2022 Group results, there is no Income Statement charge for loan forgiveness or write-off as a result of the waiver, and net assets and liabilities for Oyu Tolgoi included in the Group Balance sheet remained unchanged as a result of this transaction. There was no exchange of cash or other financial assets between parties and there has been no change to the underlying free cash flows of the Oyu Tolgoi operations and development project. The waiver did not have an impact on the Group's assessment of impairment indicators for either 2021 or 2022, since it related to the project shareholders' funding arrangements rather than the economic capability of the Cash Generating Unit itself. A reallocation of the net asset value allocation between the owners of Oyu Tolgoi has been recorded in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity for 2022 by reducing equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto and increasing equity attributable to non-controlling interests.\n\n## 31   Principal joint operations\n\n## At 31 December 2022\n\n| Company and country of incorporation/operation   | Principal activities                          | Group interest (%)                               |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Australia                                        |                                               |                                                  |\n| Tomago Aluminium Joint Venture                   | Aluminium smelting                            | 51.6                                             |\n| Gladstone Power Station Joint Venture            | Power generation                              | 42.1                                             |\n| Hope Downs Joint Venture                         | Iron ore mining                               | 50                                               |\n| Queensland Alumina Limited (a)(b)                | Alumina production                            | 80                                               |\n| Pilbara Iron Arrangements                        | Infrastructure, corporate and mining services | See other relevant judgments call  out box below |\n| New Zealand                                      |                                               |                                                  |\n| New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Limited (a)(b)    | Aluminium smelting                            | 79.4                                             |\n| Canada                                           |                                               |                                                  |\n| Aluminerie Alouette Inc.                         | Aluminium production                          | 40                                               |\n| US                                               |                                               |                                                  |\n| Pechiney Reynolds Quebec Inc (b)(c)              | Aluminium smelting                            | 50.2                                             |\n\n213",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 2022 financial statements\n\n## 31   Principal joint operations continued\n\n## Other relevant judgments - Basis of consolidation of Queensland Alumina Limited ('QAL')\n\nJudgment is sometimes required to assess whether, after considering all relevant factors, we have control or joint control.  QAL is 80% owned by Rio Tinto and 20% owned by RUSAL.  Typically such ownership interests would provide control; however, we have determined in this case that the shareholders' agreement, which requires unanimous agreement over certain relevant activities of QAL, means that this non-managed operation is jointly controlled. The entity operates the joint operation on a tolling basis, processing bauxite supplied by the shareholders into alumina, which they off-take in their respective ownership share.\n\nFollowing the Australian Governments's imposition of Trade Sanctions against Russia, QAL considered that they were no longer able to process bauxite on behalf of RUSAL and therefore enacted the 'step-in' clause of the shareholders' agreement that enabled Rio Tinto to contribute additional bauxite tonnes to ensure that 100% of production capacity was maintained. The decisions requiring unanimous consent referred to above are restricted during the step-in period.\n\nDue to the step-in, we have re-assessed whether our conclusion of having joint control is still valid, considering we own 80% of the entity but currently take all plant production. If this resulted in our control of QAL we would need to account for that change as a business combination. Based on the following facts:\n\n- -RUSAL has commenced proceedings in the Australian Federal Court contending that the sanctions should not apply in these circumstances and therefore the step-in rights should not apply; and\n- -the continued operation of the shareholders' agreement, incorporating the 'step-in' clause,\n\nwe have concluded that we have joint control of the entity at 31 December 2022 and therefore continue to account for QAL as a joint operation.\n\n## Other relevant judgments - Accounting for the Pilbara Iron Arrangements\n\nA number of arrangements are in place amongst the Australian Iron Ore operations, managed by Rio Tinto, which allow their respective assets to be operated as a single integrated network across the Pilbara region. In assessing the Pilbara Iron Arrangements, it has been concluded that they collectively constitute a joint operation on the basis that decisions about relevant activities require unanimous consent. The resulting efficiencies are shared between Rio Tinto and Robe River Iron Associates (Robe River), and the parties fund all of the cash flow requirements of Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd.\n\nEach of the partners in the joint operation is able to request the other to construct assets on their tenure to increase the capacity of the rail and port infrastructure network. The requesting partner's (Asset User's) share of the capacity of the network will increase by the capacity of the newly constructed asset, but generally that capacity may be provided from any of the network assets. The Asset User will pay an annual charge (Committed Use Charge - 'CUC') over a contractually specified period irrespective of network usage. The constructing partner (Asset Owner) has an ongoing obligation to make available capacity from those assets and to maintain the assets in good working order as required under relevant State Agreements and associated tenure.  The arrangements are managed through two wholly owned subsidiaries: Pilbara Iron (Company) Services Pty Ltd and Pilbara Iron Pty Ltd.\n\nWe have also considered whether the CUC arrangements give rise to a lease between the Asset Owner and the Asset User. We have concluded that they do not, as there is no specified asset; rather the Asset User has a first priority right to the capacity in the CUC asset. This treatment was grandfathered on adoption of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, following assessment under the preceding standards IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease', with no change to the conclusion under IFRS 16 for subsequent expenditure subject to the existing CUC arrangements. Management considers that these arrangements are unique and has used judgment to apply the principles of IFRS to the accounting for the arrangements as described above. The obligation of the Asset Owner to make capacity available is fulfilled over time and not at a point in time. The CUC arrangement is therefore an executory contract as defined under IAS 37, whereby neither party has performed any of its obligations, or both parties have partially performed their obligations to an equal extent, and so the CUC payments are expensed as incurred. An alternative interpretation of the fact pattern could have resulted in a gross presentation in the Group's balance sheet with an asset and a corresponding liability to reflect the present value of the CUC payments. The Asset User is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rio Tinto, whereas the Asset Owner is a joint operation. This impact would be some US$948 million (calculated on the basis of grossing up the tax written down value of the CUC assets). Other methods of calculating the gross-up might give rise to different numbers.\n\n214",

We have based this on the nature of significant commercial decisions, including capital expenditure, which require approval of both Rio Tinto and its partner BHP (holders of a 57.5% interest). In contrast, our partner has assessed Rio Tinto's rights as protective and concluded that it controls Escondida through its rights to direct relevant activities. Adoption of the equivalent judgment by the Group would result in reclassification of Escondida from a joint venture to an associate, with no other financial reporting consequence since accounting under the equity method would remain in place.\n\n## Summary information for joint ventures that are material to the Group\n\nThis summarised financial information is shown on a 100% basis. It represents the amounts shown in the joint ventures' financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS under Group accounting policies, including fair value adjustments and amounts due to and from Rio Tinto.\n\n|                                                         | Minera  Escondida  Ltda (c) 2022 US$m   | Minera  Escondida  Ltda (c) 2021 US$m   | Sohar  Aluminium  Co.L.L.C.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\n\nWhere any Group company purchases the Group's equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes) is deducted from equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to owners of Rio Tinto. If purchased Rio Tinto plc shares are cancelled, an amount equal to the nominal value of the cancelled share is credited to the capital redemption reserve.\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\n|                                                                    | 2022  Number (million)   | 2021 Number (million)   | 2020 Number (million)   | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   | 2020 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Issued and fully paid up share capital of 10p each                 |                          |                         |                         |              |             |             |\n| At 1 January                                                       | 1,255.795                | 1,255.756               | 1,259.345               | 207          | 207         | 207         |\n| Ordinary shares issued under the Global Employee Share plan (GESP) | 0.050                    | 0.039                   | 0.039                   | -            | -           | -           |\n| Shares purchased and cancelled (a)                                 | -                        | -                       | (3.628)                 | -            | -           | -           |\n| At 31 December                                                     | 1,255.845                | 1,255.795               | 1,255.756               | 207          | 207         | 207         |\n| Shares held by public                                              |                          |                         |                         |              |             |             |\n| At 1 January                                                       | 1,248.141                | 1,246.904               | 1,249.924               |              |             |             |\n| Shares reissued from treasury under the GESP                       | 1.464                    | 1.198                   | 0.569                   |              |             |             |\n| Ordinary shares issued under the GESP                              | 0.050                    | 0.039                   | 0.039                   |              |             |             |\n| Shares purchased and cancelled (a)                                 | -                        | -                       | (3.628)                 |              |             |             |\n| At 31 December                                                     | 1,249.655                | 1,248.141               | 1,246.904               |              |             |             |\n| Shares held in treasury                                            | 6.190                    | 7.654                   | 8.852                   |              |             |             |\n| Shares held by public                                              | 1,249.655                | 1,248.141               | 1,246.904               |              |             |             |\n| Total share capital                                                | 1,255.845                | 1,255.795               | 1,255.756               |              |             |             |\n| Other share classes                                                |                          |                         |                         |              |             |             |\n| Special Voting Share of 10p each (b)                               | 1 only                   | 1 only                  | 1 only                  |              |             |             |\n| DLC Dividend Share of 10p each (b)                                 | 1 only                   | 1 only                  | 1 only                  |              |             |             |\n\nDuring 2022, US$16 million of shares and ADRs (2021: US$18 million; 2020: US$31 million) were purchased by employee share ownership trusts on behalf of Rio Tinto plc to satisfy employee share awards on vesting.

These are quantified unless, in our judgment, the amount cannot be reliably estimated. The unit of account for claims is the matter taken as a whole and therefore when a provision has been recorded for the best estimate of the cost to settle the obligation there is no further contingent liability component. This means that when a provision is recognised for the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation from a single past event, a further contingent liability is not reported for the maximum potential exposure in excess of that already provided.\n\nWe have not established provisions for certain additional legal claims in cases where we have assessed that a payment is either not probable or cannot be reliably estimated. A number of our companies are, and will likely continue to be, subject to various legal proceedings and investigations that arise from time to time. As a result, the Group may become subject to substantial liabilities that could affect our business, financial position and reputation. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and large judgments may at times occur. The Group may in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could lead to material cash outflows. We do not believe that any of these proceedings will have a materially adverse effect on our financial position.\n\n|                                                                          |   2022  US$m |   2021 US$m |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Contingent liabilities, indemnities and other performance guarantees (a) |          498 |         441 |\n\n219",

The SEC alleges that  Rio Tinto, a former chief executive, Tom Albanese, and a former chief financial officer,  Guy Elliott, committed violations of the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and |\n| 2011 Contractual payments in Guinea                                                            | Rio Tinto continues to co-operate fully with relevant authorities in connection with their  investigations in relation to contractual payments totalling US$10.5 million made to a  consultant who had provided advisory services in 2011 on the Simandou project in  Guinea. In August 2018, the court dismissed a related US class action commenced on  behalf of securities holders. No provision has been recognised for this case.                                                                                                       |\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the outcomes of the matters remain uncertain, but they could ultimately expose the Group to material financial cost. We believe these cases are unwarranted and will defend the allegations vigorously. A dedicated Board committee continues to monitor the progress of these matters, as appropriate.\n\nOn 6 March 2022 we reached a settlement with ASIC regarding the disclosure of the impairment of Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM), which was reflected in Rio Tinto's 2012 year-end accounts. This was previously disclosed as a contingent liability at 31 December 2021. As part of the court approved settlement, we paid a A$750,000 penalty for a single contravention of our continuous disclosure obligations in the period 21 December 2012 to 17 January 2013, immediately preceding the impairment announcement. As part of this court approved settlement between ASIC and Rio Tinto, there were no findings of fraud or any systemic or widespread failure by Rio Tinto. The case against Tom Albanese and Guy Elliott brought by ASIC has been wholly dismissed.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nWe are modernising agreements with Traditional Owner groups in response to the Juukan Gorge incident. We have created provisions, within 'Other provisions',  based on our best estimate of historical claims; however, the process is incomplete and it is possible that further claims could arise relating to past events.\n\nClose-down and restoration provisions are not recognised for those operations that have no known restrictions on their lives as the date of closure cannot be reliably estimated. This applies primarily to our Canadian aluminium smelters, which are not dependent upon a specific orebody and have access to indefinite-lived power from owned hydro-power stations with water rights permitted by local governments. In these instances, a closure obligation may exist at the reporting date; however, due to the indefinite nature of asset lives it is not possible to arrive at a sufficiently reliable estimate for the purposes of recognising a provision. Close-down and restoration provisions are recognised at these operations for separately identifiable closure activities which can be reasonably estimated, such as the demolition and removal of fixed structures after a pre-determined period. Any contingent liability for these assets will crystallise into a closure provision if and when a decision is taken to cease operations.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nThe Group has, from time to time, various insurance claims outstanding with reinsurers. Recognition of any assets arising takes place once the insurance company has agreed to refund the claims and the amount is quantifiable. This is usually in the same period as payment is received.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nOur capital commitments include open purchase orders for managed operations and expenditure on major projects already authorised by our Investment Committee for non-managed operations. It does not include the estimated incremental capital expenditure relating to decarbonisation projects of US$7.5 billion between 2022 and 2030 unless otherwise contractually committed. On a legally enforceable basis, capital commitments would be approximately US$1.0 billion (2021: US$1.1 billion) as many of the contracts relating to the Group's projects have various cancellation clauses.\n\n220",

The Group immediately sells the purchased products to third parties; in an active market, and therefore does not recognise the purchase obligation.\n\nAlong with the other joint venture partners, we have commitments to provide emergency funding (such as funding required to preserve the life or assets of the company or to comply with applicable laws) if required by Sohar Aluminium Company L.L.C., subject to approved thresholds.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Minera Escondida Ltda held an undrawn shareholder line of credit for US$225 million (Rio Tinto share) (31 December 2021: US$225 million). The current facility has been extended during the year and will now mature in September 2023.\n\n## Purchase obligations\n\nPurchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding agreements to buy goods or services. They specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased or consumed; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transactions.\n\nPurchase obligations for goods mainly relate to purchases of raw materials and consumables, and purchase obligations for services mainly relate to charges for the use of infrastructure, commitments to purchase power and freight contracts. These goods and services are expected to be used in the business. To the extent that this changes, a provision for onerous obligations may be made.\n\nPurchases from joint arrangements or associates are included if the quantity to be purchased is in excess of our ownership interest in the entity. However, purchase obligations exclude contracted purchases of bauxite, alumina and aluminium from joint arrangements and associates and contracted purchases of alumina from third parties. This is because these purchases are made for commercial reasons and the Group is, overall, a net seller of these commodities.\n\nThe aggregate amount of future payment commitments under purchase obligations outstanding at 31 December was:\n\n|                       | 2022  US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|-----------------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Within 1 year         | 3,618        | 3,483       |\n| Between 1 and 2 years | 2,091        | 1,660       |\n| Between 2 and 3 years | 1,632        | 1,345       |\n| Between 3 and 4 years | 1,309        | 1,080       |\n| Between 4 and 5 years | 907          | 1,020       |\n| After 5 years         | 6,574        | 7,125       |\n| Total                 | 16,131       | 15,713      |\n\n## Guarantees by parent companies\n\nRio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited have, jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the following securities issued by the following 100% owned finance subsidiaries: US$4.4 billion (31 December 2021: US$4.4 billion) Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Limited and Rio Tinto Finance (USA) plc bonds with maturity dates up to 2051; and US$1 billion (31 December 2021: US$1.1 billion) on the European Debt Issuance Programme. In addition, Rio Tinto Finance plc and Rio Tinto Finance Limited have entered into undrawn facility arrangements for an aggregate amount of US$7.5 billion (31 December 2021: US$7.5 billion). The facilities are guaranteed by Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. At 31 December 2022, US$3.9 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (2021: US$4.3 billion). Rio Tinto plc, through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia. The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.\n\nThe Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC's project finance debt servicing obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\n221",

The lenders have agreed to a deferral of the principal repayments by three years to June 2026 and to an extension of the final maturity date by five years from 2030 to 2035. The terms and conditions are broadly unchanged and lenders continue to benefit from the Debt Service Undertaking from Turquoise Hill Resources Limited and the Completion Support Undertaking from Rio Tinto plc.\n\nThere were no other significant events after the balance sheet date requiring disclosure.\n\n## 40  New standards issued but not yet effective\n\nWe have not early adopted any new accounting standards or amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective.\n\n## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes, mandatory in 2023 and endorsed by the UK)\n\nThe Group will adopt, from January 2023 (the transition date),  the narrow-scope amendments to IAS 12, which introduce an exclusion to the initial recognition exemption application for transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n\nOur existing accounting policy states that 'where the recognition of an asset and liability from a single transaction gives rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences, Rio Tinto applies the initial recognition exemption allowed by IAS 12, and consequently recognises neither a deferred tax asset nor a deferred tax liability in respect of these temporary differences'. Under the amendments, deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be recognised in respect of such temporary differences from the transition date, with restatement of comparatives for 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe most significant impact of implementing these amendments is expected to be from temporary differences related to the Group's provisions for close-down and restoration (note 14), and lease obligations (note 21) and corresponding capitalised closure costs and right of use assets (note 13). Adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities related to these balances will be recognised as at 1 January 2021, being the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in 2023 financial statements, with the cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date. For other transactions the amendments apply only to those taking place on or after 1 January 2021.\n\nThe impact of restatement as at 31 December 2022 is that the Group will recognise additional gross deferred tax liabilities of US$922 million and gross deferred tax assets of US$1.4 billion in relation to close-down and restoration obligations and related capitalised closure costs. The Group will also recognise additional gross deferred tax liabilities of US$140 million and gross deferred tax assets of US$149 million in relation to lease liabilities and related right of use assets (note 15).\n\nAfter the required offsetting within the same tax jurisdiction, these adjustments result in the Group recognising additional net deferred tax assets of US$30 million and a reduction in net deferred tax liabilities of US$437 million (note 15) with the resulting cumulative impact increasing retained earnings (inclusive of income statement adjustments described below) by US$459 million. As at 1 January 2021 and 31 December 2021, the restatement of gross and net deferred tax balances does not differ materially from the impact as at 31 December 2022.\n\n222",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Rio Tinto plc Financial Statements\n\n## A Principal accounting policies\n\n## a. Basis of preparation\n\nThe Rio Tinto plc company financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial liabilities and in accordance with the UK Companies Act 2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101'). The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. The following exemptions available under FRS 101 have been applied:\n\n- - Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based Payment' (details of the number and weighted average exercise prices of share options and how the fair value of goods and services received was determined).\n- - Paragraphs 91-99 of IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement' (disclosure of valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurement of assets and liabilities).\n- - IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'.\n- - Paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', comparative information requirements in respect of Paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- - The following paragraphs of IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- -10 (d) (statement of cash flows);\n- -16 (statement of compliance with all IFRS);\n- -38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements);\n- -38B-D (additional comparative information);\n- -111 (cash flow statement information); and\n- -134-136 (capital management disclosures).\n- - IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows'.\n- - Paragraph 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued and is not yet effective).\n- - Paragraph 17 of IAS 24 'Related party disclosures' (key management compensation).\n- - The requirements of IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group.\n\n## b. Judgments in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates and to use judgment in applying accounting policies and making critical accounting estimates. These judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, having regard to previous experience, but actual results may differ materially from the amounts included in the financial statements.\n\nThe key area of judgment that has the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is the review for impairment of investment carrying values.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. The unit of account being the equity of the subsidiary taken as a whole, which may include interests in multiple cash-generating units.\n\nIf any such indication exists, Rio Tinto plc makes an assessment of the recoverable amount. If the asset is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss will be recorded and the asset written down based on the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## c. Currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates (the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the company's functional and presentation currency. Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nExchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on page 151.\n\n## d. Investments\n\nInvestments in Group companies are valued at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## e. Financial guarantees\n\nFinancial guarantees are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently, the liability is measured at the higher of the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation.\n\n## f. Share-based payments\n\nThe Company operates a number of share-based payment plans for Group employees, the details of which are included in the consolidated financial statements (note 27). The fair value of the Company's share plans is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected vesting period, with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. Payments received from the Company's subsidiaries in respect of these share-based payments are recognised as a reduction in the cost of the investment. The Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries calculated using either a lattice-based option valuation model or a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market-based vesting conditions attached to the award.\n\nNon-market based vesting conditions (for example relative EBIT margin performance targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.\n\n## g. Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## h. Treasury shares\n\nThe consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders' funds through retained earnings.\n\n245",

In addition, these entities also jointly guarantee the Group's undrawn credit facility which was US$7.5 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$7.5 billion). Rio Tinto plc has provided guarantees in respect of certain derivative contracts that are in a liability position of US$523 million at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: US$273 million).\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a guarantee, known as the completion support undertaking (CSU), in favour of the Oyu Tolgoi LLC project finance lenders. At 31 December 2022, US$3.9 billion of project finance debt was outstanding under this facility (31 December 2021: US$4.3 billion). Rio Tinto plc, through its subsidiaries, owns 66% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC with the remaining share owned by Erdenes Oyu Tolgoi LLC (34%), which is controlled by the Government of Mongolia. The project finance has been raised for development of the underground mine and the CSU will terminate on the completion of the underground mine according to a set of completion tests set out in the project finance facility.\n\nThe Rio Tinto guarantee applies to the extent that Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd cannot satisfy Oyu Tolgoi LLC's project finance debt servicing obligations under its own guarantee to the lenders, called the sponsor debt service undertaking (DSU). Both the CSU and DSU contain a carve-out for certain political risk events.\n\nDuring 2022, fees of US$101 million (2021: US$108 million) were received from Oyu Tolgoi LLC and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd as consideration for the provision of the CSU.\n\nRio Tinto plc has provided a number of guarantees in relation to various pension funds. Subject to certain conditions, Rio Tinto plc would pay any contributions due from Group companies participating in these funds should the companies fail to meet their contribution requirements. The guarantees were not called upon in 2022.

        "page_content": "## Australian Corporations Act Summary of ASIC Relief\n\nPursuant to section 340 of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Corporations Act), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission issued an order dated 16 July 2021 that granted relief to Rio Tinto Limited from certain requirements of the Corporations Act in relation to its financial statements and associated reports. The order essentially continues the relief that has applied to Rio Tinto Limited since the formation of the Group's dual listed companies (DLC) structure in 1995. The order applies to Rio Tinto Limited's financial reporting obligations for the financial years up to and including 31 December 2023.\n\nIn essence, instead of being required under the Corporations Act to prepare consolidated financial statements covering Rio Tinto Limited and its controlled entities, it allows the Company to prepare consolidated financial statements in which it, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities are treated as a single economic entity. In addition, those consolidated financial statements are to be prepared:\n\n- -in accordance with the principles and requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom (UK IFRS) rather than the Australian Accounting Standards (AAS) (except for one limited instance in the case of any concise report), and in accordance with UK financial reporting obligations generally;\n- -on the basis that the transitional provisions of International Financial Reporting Standard 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, should be applied using the combined financial statements previously prepared for Rio Tinto Limited, Rio Tinto plc and their respective controlled entities under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United Kingdom, under which the DLC Merger between Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc was accounted for using 'merger', rather than 'acquisition', accounting (reflecting that neither Rio Tinto Limited nor Rio Tinto plc was acquired by, or is controlled by, the other; and meaning that the existing carrying amounts, rather than fair values, of assets and liabilities at the time of the DLC Merger were used to measure those assets and liabilities at formation);\n- -on the basis that Rio Tinto Limited and Rio Tinto plc are a single company (with their respective shareholders being the shareholders in that single company); and\n- -with a reconciliation, from UK IFRS to AAS, of the following amounts: consolidated loss/profit for the financial year, total consolidated comprehensive loss/income for the financial year and total consolidated equity at the end of the financial year (see page 155).\n\nThose consolidated financial statements must also be audited in relation to their compliance with relevant Australian and UK requirements. Rio Tinto Limited must also prepare a Directors' Report which satisfies the content requirements of the Corporations Act (applied on the basis that for these purposes the consolidated entity is the Group, and the consolidated financial statements cover the Group). This includes a Remuneration Report (see pages 110 to 135) prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is also required to comply generally with the lodgement and distribution requirements of the Corporations Act (including timing requirements) in relation to those consolidated financial statements (including any concise financial statements), the Auditors' report and the Directors' Report. The Corporations Act also requires that a non-binding resolution to adopt the Remuneration Report be voted on by shareholders at Rio Tinto Limited's annual general meeting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited is not required to prepare separate consolidated financial statements solely for it and its controlled entities. Rio Tinto Limited is also not required to prepare and lodge parent entity financial statements for itself in respect of each relevant financial year.\n\nRio Tinto Limited must, however, in accordance with the Corporations Act include in the consolidated financial statements for the Group, as a note, various parent entity information regarding Rio Tinto Limited (including in relation to assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity, profit and loss, income, guarantees, contingent liabilities, and contractual commitments) prepared in accordance with AAS (see page 223).\n\n249",

We have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework, and applicable law).  Under Australian law, the directors are also required to prepare certain Rio Tinto Limited parent company financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AAS). In preparing the Group financial statements, the directors have also elected to comply with IFRS, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nUnder UK and Australian company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the companies as at the end of the financial year, and of the profit or loss of the companies and Group for the period (as applicable).\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- -select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n- -make judgments and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;\n- -state whether applicable UK adopted international accounting standards and AAS have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and parent company financial statements respectively;\n- -assess the Group and companies' ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern;\n- -use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the companies or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of the companies and the Group and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the companies and the Group and enable them to ensure that:\n\n- -the Group financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021;\n- -the Rio Tinto plc financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006;\n- -the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures comply with the Corporations Act as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021; and\n- -the Remuneration Report complies with the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDominic Barton Chair\n\nJakob Stausholm Chief Executive\n\nPeter Cunningham Chief Financial Officer\n\n250\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the companies and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Group's website. Legislation governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ between jurisdictions in which the Group reports.\n\nEach of the current directors, whose names and function are listed on pages 90 and 91 in the Governance section, confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- -the Rio Tinto Group financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021 and the UK Companies Act 2006, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group;\n- -the Rio Tinto plc financial statements and notes, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;\n- -the Rio Tinto Limited parent company disclosures, which have been prepared in accordance with the AAS and Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company;\n- -the Strategic Report section of the Annual Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and\n- -there are reasonable grounds to believe that each of the Rio Tinto Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable.\n\nThe directors have been given the declarations by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer required by section 295A of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Order dated 16 July 2021.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nThe directors in office at the date of this report have each confirmed that:\n\n- -so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Group's auditors are unaware; and\n- -they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Group's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nThis declaration is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board.",

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS\n\nFollowing our FY21 audits, and considering developments affecting the Rio Tinto Group since then, our assessment of risks and our view of how these impact the audit of the financial statements have been updated for the current year where needed.\n\nThe  Kitimat  and  Oyu  Tolgoi  CGUs  were  tested  for  impairment  in  FY21,  with  significant  estimation  uncertainty inherent in key assumptions. Our assessment is that the risk has reduced following these impairment tests based on our understanding of these CGUs' markets and lack of indicators in the current year. Our focus has been on changes in the macro-economic environment and long-term forecast commodity prices, which in addition to operational performance or development of these CGUs were the key factors driving our view of risks.\n\nOur assessment of risk on specific closure provisions remained consistent. The increase in significance as a result of volatility in macro-economic factors such as closure discount rate was neutralised by the reduction of sites with new closure studies. The closure provision for certain sites within Iron Ore remains a key audit matter ('KAM') in FY22, while closure provisions at Gove refinery and Energy Resources of Australia, which formed a part of this KAM in FY21, were no longer assessed to be of such significance as to be included in FY22.\n\nOur assessment of risk in respect to the Group's uncertain tax positions has reduced resulting from the Group's settlement with Australian Taxation Office ('ATO') earlier in FY22, and is therefore no longer considered a Key Audit Matter.\n\nOur  assessment  of  risk  of  recoverability  of  the  UK  Parent  company's  investment  in  subsidiaries  has  remained consistent and remains as a Key Audit Matter for the UK Parent company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                |                                                                                                                                   | Audit risk significance  FY22 vs FY21   |   Item |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|\n| Recurring   key audit  matters | Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of  property, plant and equipment in specific cash generating units | \uf0ea\uf020                                      |    4.1 |\n| Recurring   key audit  matters | Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and  environmental obligations ('closure provisions')               | \uf0e7 \uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0e8\uf020\uf020                                 |    4.2 |\n| Recurring   key audit  matters | Evaluation  of  recoverability  of  Rio  Tinto  plc's  Investments  in  subsidiaries (KPMG UK only)                               | \uf0e7 \uf0e7\uf0e8\uf0e8\uf020                                  |    4.3 |\n\nIn relation to FY22, the Audit and Risk committee ('AC') met six times. KPMG are invited to attend all Audit and Risk committee meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the AC in private sessions without Executive Directors or management being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the Audit and Risk committee in Section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.\n\nThe matters included in the Audit and Risk committee Chair's report on page 105 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\nWe  have  fulfilled  our  ethical  responsibilities  under,  and  we  remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including  the  FRC  Ethical  Standard  as  applied  to  listed  public  interest entities; the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as amended by the ASIC Order;  and  the  relevant  ethical  requirements  of  the  Australian Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards).\n\nApart from the matters noted below, we have not performed any nonaudit services during the year ended 31 December 2022 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nDuring  2023,  we  identified  that  certain  KPMG  member  firms  had provided  preparation  of  local  GAAP  financial  statement  services  or language  translation  services  over  the  period  2020  to  2022  to  certain group entities. The entities to which the services were provided were not material to the group and no audit procedures were performed on these entities for the purpose of the group audit. The services, which have been terminated,  were  administrative  in  nature  and  did  not  involve  any management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work was undertaken after the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG LLP for the impacted financial  years  and  had  no  direct  or  indirect  effect  on  Rio  Tinto's consolidated financial statements.\n\nFactors driving our view of risks\n\nAudit and Risk committee interaction (previously known as Audit committee)\n\nOur independence\n\n| Total fees                                                | US$29.3m                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Audit related fees  (including interim  review)           | US$25.7m                     |\n| Other services                                            | US$3.6m                      |\n| Non-audit fee as a  % of audit fee %                      | 14%                          |\n| Date appointed by                                         | KPMG UK  08 April 2020       |\n| members                                                   | KPMG Australia  05 May 2020  |\n| Uninterrupted  audit tenure  Next financial  period which | 3 financial years  31-Dec-30 |",

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONT'D)\n\n## Our independence (cont'd)\n\n## Materiality (Section 6 below)\n\n## Group scope (Section 7 below)\n\nIn our professional judgement, we confirm that based on our assessment of the breach, our integrity and objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the provision of these services would not impair our integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The audit and risk committee concurred with this view.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditors by the members for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the three financial years ended 31 December 2022. The Group engagement partners are required to rotate every 5 years. Trevor Hart and Jonathan Downer are required to rotate off after the FY24 and FY25 audits respectively. The average tenure of partners responsible for component audits is 2.8 years, with the shortest being 2 years and the longest being 3 years.\n\nThe  scope  of  our  work  is  influenced  by  our  view  of  materiality  and  our  assessment  of  the  risks  of  material misstatement.\n\nWe  have  determined  overall  materiality  for  the  Group  financial  statements  as  a  whole  at  US$700m  (FY21: US$700m). For both FY22 and FY21, we determined profit before taxation to be an appropriate benchmark for our assessment of materiality. The materiality represented 3.8% of this benchmark in FY22 (FY21: 2.3% of adjusted profit before taxation). In FY21, we adjusted profit before taxation to exclude certain items that were significant and did not represent normal, continuing operations in determining our materiality. This exclusion was US$269m related to the net pre-tax impairment charge of US$269m on the Group's Kitimat asset. There were no such significant items to adjust the profit before taxation for in FY22 in determining materiality.\n\nKPMG UK has determined the overall materiality for Rio Tinto plc company financial statements as a whole at US$500m (FY21: US$500m). Consistent with FY21, we determined total assets remained the benchmark for Rio Tinto plc company financial statements. The materiality represented 1% (FY21: 1%) of this benchmark.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe performed our risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditors around the world. We identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole.

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONT'D)\n\nAs a part of our risk assessment throughout the audits, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and the financial statements, based on our knowledge of the Group's operations and their stated strategy with respect to climate change. Recognising the increased shareholder focus on the impact of climate change in financial reporting and financial statement audits, we are providing enhanced disclosure on the impact of climate change on our audit in this report. We do not identify the impact of climate change as a separate Key Audit Matter in our audit given the nature of the Group's operations, the impact of climate on Group's key judgements and estimates and the resulting impact on our audit effort.\n\n## The context of climate change for the Group\n\nThe Group does not mine or extract hydrocarbons such as coal, natural gas, or oil, however, it does emit greenhouse gases  directly  from  energy  used  in  its  mining  operations,  the  processing  of  metals  and  minerals,  and  the transportation of its products. Certain of the Group's products are used in energy and carbon intensive industries including steel and aluminium production. Other of the Group's products, such as copper, are expected to continue to be important in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nAs explained within page 152 of the Group's financial statements, the Group, in FY21 announced updated targets to reduce scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions relative to its 2018 baseline by 15% in 2025, by 50% in 2030 and an aim to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The Group has since disclosed its expectation to make capital expenditure of US$7.5 billion associated with decarbonisation projects, including around US$1.5 billion in the next three years.\n\n## Climate change scenarios\n\nThe Group uses climate change scenarios to support its strategic decision making, capital allocation and financial reporting.  In  the  current  year,  the  Group  has  redefined  its  climate  change  scenarios,  which  now  include  the 'Competitive leadership' and 'Fragmented Leadership' as its two core scenarios, also used to generate a central reference case for commodity forecasts and valuations. The Group has also formulated an 'Aspirational leadership' scenario which, although aligned to the Group's view of the stretch goals of the Paris Agreement, is not considered by the Group to be a core scenario. Refer pages 152 and 153 where the Group details these scenarios.\n\n## Group's assessment of financial reporting consequences\n\nIFRS requires the Group's financial reporting to be based, amongst other things, on the Group's best estimate of assumptions that are reasonable and supportable as at the date of reporting. Those assumptions may not align with the ways in which the global economy, society and government policies will need to change to meet the targets to limit global warming to 1.5 o c which is aligned with the stretch goal of the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Group has detailed how it has considered the financial reporting consequences of climate change on pages 152 to 155 of the financial statements including cross references where further disclosure is included in notes to the Group financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response\n\n## General risk assessment procedures\n\nAs part of our risk assessment procedures, we made enquiries, with the assistance of our sustainability specialists, of  key  members of management. Our enquiries focussed on understanding the progress of the Group's climate related strategy and identifying those areas where climate change could have a potential material impact on the financial statements. Our enquiries also focussed on understanding the progress made by the Group in meeting its revised Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets, announced in FY21, and understanding the Group's actual capital expenditure in relation to its decarbonisation strategy compared to that planned. We involved our sustainability specialists in our internal risk assessment and planning discussions, where we discussed the Group's climate strategy, and considered potential material impacts to the financial statements.\n\nSpecific risk assessment procedures with regards to recoverable value of the Group's assets, consideration of asset obsolescence and assessment of useful economic lives\n\nAs the Group continues to progress its climate change strategy, we have considered the impact of climate change when evaluating indicators of impairment of property, plant and equipment for the cash-generating units ('CGUs') in-scope for the Group audit for FY22. In FY21, we had included our evaluation of the impairment assessment in the Oyu Tolgoi and Kitimat CGUs in our Key Audit Matter ('KAM'). We had involved sustainability specialists to assist in understanding the Group's approach to incorporating the impacts of climate change into the pricing process and comparing carbon pricing assumptions to publicly available information. In FY22 the KAM was evaluating whether there were indicators of impairment or reversal of impairment that would, in turn, require a full impairment test to be performed.\n\nThe impact of climate change on our audits",

OVERVIEW OF OUR AUDITS (CONT'D)\n\n## Our audit response (cont'd)\n\nAs part of our risk assessment, we made specific enquiries to assess risk of material misstatement arising from the Group's progress on its stated climate strategy. Our enquiries  with Group personnel and other risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 whether the solar power plant commissioned at Gudai-Darri has affected associated energy contracts or useful lives of power infrastructure in the Pilbara;\n- \u00b7 the  status  of  the  Group's  plan  to  electrify  its  existing  fleet,  including  locomotives  in  the  Pilbara  and considerations for asset obsolescence or re-estimation of useful lives;\n- \u00b7 the  status  of  the  plans  relating  to  renewable  energy  solutions  for  Queensland  Aluminium  assets  including expectations  of  timing  compared  to  the  current  economic  life  of  related  assets.  We  also  assessed  these expectations against our understanding of the industry with the assistance of our sustainability specialists;\n- \u00b7 understanding the Group's process to continue assessing the impact of climate change on physical risk to its operations and accounting impact, if any. This included understanding whether physical risk had impacted the Group's judgement on the useful economic life of its water rights in Quebec (currently indefinite); and\n- \u00b7 understanding the indicators which led to the impairment of the Boyne Smelters and its relevance to other assets of the Group.\n\nAs a result of our risk assessment procedures, taking into account factors such as the stage of development and expected timing of asset replacement projects compared to existing useful economic lives, we have not identified a risk of material misstatement to these financial statements relating to the group's progress on its stated climate strategy.\n\nAs the Group continues implementing its climate strategy, there may be material accounting considerations and consequences in the future, including impact on recoverable amounts of key assets as well re-estimation of useful economic lives.\n\n## Other audit procedures\n\nDuring the course of our audits, we carried out the following additional audit procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the Group's processes for disclosures related to climate change in the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 we have evaluated certain material closure provisions of the Group, cost estimates of which consider impact of climate change. This consideration was not so significant as to warrant separate discussion in our KAM on evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental;\n- \u00b7 we evaluated the Group's disclosure on coal royalties, disclosed in note 24;\n- \u00b7 we read the disclosures related to climate change in the Directors' Report and Strategic Report, including the TCFD recommended disclosures, and considered its consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge; and\n- \u00b7 we  assessed  the  consistency  between  the  Group's  estimate  of  the  capital  expenditure  planned  for decarbonisation of US$7.5 billion with the cash flows used in its going concern and viability assessments.\n\nThe impact of climate change on our audits",

GOING CONCERN, VIABILITY AND PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (KPMG UK ONLY)\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the UK parent company or the Group or to cease their operations, and they have concluded that the UK parent company's and the Group's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe  used  our  knowledge  of  the  Group,  its  industry,  and  the  general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks we  consider  as  most  relevant  to  the  level  of  the  Group's  financial resources  over  this  period  relate  to  levels  of  demand  and  commodity pricing of key products.\n\nWe  critically  assessed  the  assumptions  in  the  Directors'  downside scenarios  relevant  to  liquidity  and  covenant  metrics,  in  particular  in relation to revenue growth by assessing:\n\n- \u00b7 The  directors'  forecasting  by  comparing  previous  forecasts  with actual results;\n- \u00b7 The  assumptions  in  the  Group's  forecast  of  reasonably  possible downsides; and\n- \u00b7 The impact of applying more severe downside scenarios\n\nThe extent of our work was influenced by the level of liquidity. We also assessed the completeness of the going concern disclosure.\n\nAccordingly, based on those procedures, we found the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the Group and UK Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee  that  the  Group  or  the  Parent  Company  will  continue  in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\nWe consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Group's and UK parent company's financial statements is appropriate.\n\nWe  have  not  identified,  and  concur  with  the  Directors' assessment that there is not a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or UK parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.\n\nWe  have  nothing  material  to  add  or  draw  attention  to  in relation to the Directors' statement in the section 'about the presentation of financial statements' in the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and UK parent company's use of that basis for the  going  concern  period,  and  we  found  the  going  concern disclosure in to be acceptable.\n\nThe related statement under the UK Listing Rules set out on page 141 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Disclosures on emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \uf0a7 the directors' confirmation within the longer-term viability statement on page 78 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \uf0a7 the Principal Risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \uf0a7 the directors' explanation in the longer-term viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the longer-term viability statement set out on page 78 under the Listing Rules.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audits. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and UK parent company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe  have  nothing  material  to  add  or draw  attention  to  in  relation  to  these disclosures.\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures  are  materially  consistent with  the  financial  statements  and  our audit knowledge.",

KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audits of the current year financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- \u00b7 the overall audit strategies;\n- \u00b7 the allocation of resources in the audits; and\n- \u00b7 directing the efforts of the engagement teams.\n\nWe include below the key audit matters for the Group and Company, in decreasing order of audit significance, together with our principal audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures.

KEY AUDIT MATTERS (CONT'D)\n\n## 4.2  Evaluation  of  specific  provisions  for  close-down,  restoration  and  environmental  obligations  ('closure  provisions') (cont'd)\n\n## Description of the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nThe Group incurs legal and constructive obligations for closedown and restoration activities which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, the removal of residual materials and the remediation of disturbed areas for mines and certain refineries and smelters. Generally, there is relatively  limited  activity  within  the  Group  or  broader industry of completing large scale restoration and rehabilitation  projects,  and  elements  of  restoration  and rehabilitation of each site are relatively unique to the site. As such,  there  are  limited  comparable  historical  precedents against which to benchmark estimates of future costs, which increases  estimation  uncertainty  for  the  Group,  and increases audit focus for us.\n\n- A  significant  proportion  of  the  Group's  assets  have  long remaining  lives,  which  also  increases  the  estimation uncertainty relating to the rehabilitation activities required and  the  timing  and  amount  of  the  associated  future  cash flows. Because of this, the effect of the time value of money is material.\n\nClose-down,  restoration  and  environmental  remediation activities  are  governed  by  a  combination  of  legislative requirements,  and  the  Group's  policies.  These  vary  across location, product and operation.\n\nThe Group has disclosed that the determination of when an estimate  associated  with  close-down,  restoration  and environmental obligations is sufficiently reliable to update is an area of judgement that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.\n\nThe evaluation of closure provisions for certain sites within Rio Tinto Iron ore ('Pilbara') is a key audit matter due to the significant amount of the provision and the judgement and specialised  skills  involved  in  our  audit  testing  of  key assumptions used by the Group to determine the provision including:\n\n- \u00b7 the future close-down and restoration costs including costs  associated  to  post-closure  monitoring  ('closure costs');\n- \u00b7 the life of the operation and the nature and timing of closure and rehabilitation activities; and\n- \u00b7 the discount rate.\n\nRefer to note 14, and the Audit and Risk committee's views set out on page 105.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Control operation\n\nEvaluating  the  design,  implementation  and  testing  the  operating effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  over  the  Group's  process  to estimate  provisions  for  close-down,  restoration  and  environmental obligations over the Group's selection of key assumptions to be used.\n\n## Tests of detail\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the scope, competency and objectivity of the Group's experts, both internal and/or external to the Group, who produce the cost estimates by examining the work they were involved to perform, their professional qualifications and experience;\n- \u00b7 We  inspected  the  most  recent  closure  studies  and  other  technical material  prepared  by  the  Group  relating  to  changes  in  the  closure provision to assess the nature and scope of restoration work planned to be undertaken. This included assumptions relating to the life of the operation  and  the  nature  and  timing  of  closure  and  rehabilitation activities and strategy;\n- \u00b7 We  compared  a  sample  of  previous  forecast  cost  assumptions  to actual costs to assess the Group's ability to accurately forecast closure costs;\n- \u00b7 Using a sample, we compared the nature, timing and quantum of costs contained in the Group's provisions to the Group's third-party expert report and internal and external underlying documentation; and\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the completeness of the provisions against the Group's analysis of where disturbance requires rehabilitation and comparing to our understanding of the Pilbara sites.\n\n## Our closure and valuation expertise\n\nWe  involved  our  valuations  professionals  with  specialised  skills  and knowledge  who  assisted  in  evaluating  the  discount  rate  applied  by  the Group to calculate the net present value of these provisions. We compared the  discount  rate  to  external  data  including  yields  on  long-term government bonds and external market research.\n\nWe involved our own environmental professionals with specialised skills and knowledge who evaluated the methodology applied by the Group's third-party  experts  and  assisted  us  in  assessing  certain  assumptions regarding  the  forecast  closure  costs  of  closure  activities  based  on  their experience  and  familiarity  with  applicable  legislative  requirements  and industry practice and the Group's closure commitments.\n\n## Assessing disclosures\n\nWe  have  assessed  the  disclosures  in  note  14  of  the  Group financial statements,  including  the  accounting  policy,  using  our  understanding obtained  from  our  testing,  against  the  requirements  of  the  accounting standard.  This  included  evaluating  the  current  and  non-current  closure provision  disclosure  for  consistency  to  the  planned  timing  of  the expenditure  as  well  as  evaluating  the  specific  disclosure  around  the discount  rate  sensitivity,  and  whether  the  disclosure  reflected  the  risks inherent in the estimation of the provision.",

The  carrying  amount  of  the  UK  parent  Company's investments  in  subsidiaries  as  noted  in  Note  B  of  the  Rio Tinto  plc  company  financial  statements  represents  70.7% (FY21: 68.7%) of the UK parent Company's total assets.\n\nTheir  recoverability  is  not  at  a  high  risk  of  significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement.\n\nHowever,  due  to  the  value  of  these  investments  in  the context of the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc's financial statements,  this  is  the  area  that  had  the  greatest  effect overall on our UK parent company audit.\n\nRefer  to  note  B  of  the  Rio  Tinto  plc  company  financial statements on page 246.\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the company's  controls  because  the  nature  of  the  balance  is  such  that  we would  expect  to  obtain  audit  evidence  primarily  through  the  detailed procedures described.\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Tests of detail\n\nWe performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 compared the carrying amount of its investments with the relevant subsidiaries' draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount; and\n- \u00b7 evaluating the UK parent company's considerations of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of the Group's CGUs within the subsidiaries owned by the UK parent company.\n\n## Communications with the Audit and Risk committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk committee included:\n\nWe reported to the Audit and Risk committee that based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the company's conclusion that there is no impairment of its investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nThere were no areas of particular auditor judgement.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe reported to the Audit and risk committee that based on the risk identified and our procedures performed, we found the company's conclusion that there is no impairment of its investments in subsidiaries to be acceptable.\n\n## Key Audit Matter for FY21, not considered to be a Key Audit Matter in FY22\n\nWe continue to perform procedures over the Group's uncertain tax positions, particularly disputes with the Mongolian Tax Authority ('MTA') regarding transaction related issues. However, the Group's settlements with Australian Taxation Office ('ATO') earlier in FY22 resulted in a significant reduction in the total exposure to the Group and in the level of judgement required by the Group in assessing uncertain tax positions. As such, we have not assessed this as  one of the matters of most significance in our current year audit and, therefore, it is not separately identified as a Key Audit Matter in our report this year.",

This included communication from the group audit team  to all component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at group level, and a request for component  auditors to report to the group audit team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could  give rise to a material misstatement of the Group financial statements. |\n| Direct laws  context and link  to the audits      | The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.   Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including:  \u00b7 \u00b7 financial reporting legislation (including related companies' legislation);  \u00b7 \u00b7 distributable profits legislation;  \u00b7 \u00b7 taxation legislation (direct and indirect); and  \u00b7 \u00b7 pensions legislation.  We assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related  |\n| Most significant  indirect  law/regulation  areas | We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect:  \u00b7 \u00b7 anti-bribery, fraud and corruption;   \u00b7 \u00b7 health and safety legislation;  \u00b7 \u00b7 employment and social security legislation;   \u00b7 \u00b7 environmental protection legislation; and   \u00b7 \u00b7 competition legislation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Known actual                                      | For  the  contingent  liabilities  disclosed  in  note  37  we  assessed  disclosures  against  our  understanding  from  legal  confirmations received from external counsel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| matters                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n\n## Context\n\nContext of the ability of the audits to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audits in  accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by UK auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

OUR DETERMINATION OF MATERIALITY\n\nThe scope of our audits was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audits and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the distinct financial statements as a whole.\n\n## What we mean by materiality for the financial statements as a whole\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audits.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at US$700m (FY21: US$700m). For both FY22 and FY21, we determined profit before taxation to be an appropriate benchmark for our assessment of materiality. The materiality represented 3.8% of this benchmark in FY22 (FY21: 2.3% of adjusted profit before taxation).\n\nIn FY21, we adjusted profit before taxation to exclude certain items that were significant and did not represent normal, continuing operations of the Group in determining our materiality. This exclusion was US$269m related to the net pre-tax impairment charge of US$269m on the Group's Kitimat asset. There were no such significant items to adjust the profit before taxation for in FY22 in determining materiality.\n\nKPMG UK has determined the materiality for Rio Tinto plc company financial statements as a whole at US$500m (FY21:  US$500m).  Consistent with  FY21,  we  determined  total  assets  remained  the  benchmark  for  Rio  Tinto  plc company financial statements. The materiality represented 1% in FY22 (FY21: 1%) of this benchmark.\n\n## What we mean by performance materiality\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances might add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (FY21: 75%) of materiality for the Rio Tinto Group financial  statements  as  a  whole  to  be  appropriate,  equating  to  US$455m  (FY21:US$525m).  We  lowered  the percentage  applied  in  our  determination  of  performance  materiality  compared  with  prior  year  based  on  our expectation of control risk at the start of the audit based on the findings of previous audits.\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 75% (FY21: 75%) of materiality for  the Rio Tinto  plc company financial  statements  as  a  whole  to  be  appropriate,  equating  to  US$375m  (FY21:US$375m).  KPMG  UK applied this percentage in the determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\n## What we mean by Audit misstatement posting threshold\n\nThis is the amount below which identified misstatements are considered to be clearly trivial from a quantitative point of view. We may become aware of misstatements below this threshold which could alter the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures, for example if we identify smaller misstatements which are indicators of fraud. This is also the amount above which all misstatements identified are communicated to Rio Tinto's Audit and Risk committee.\n\n## Basis for determining the audit misstatement reporting threshold and judgements applied\n\nWe set our audit misstatement posting threshold at 5% (FY21: 5%) of our materiality for both the Group financial statements and the UK parent company financial statements. This equated to US$35m (FY21: US$35m) for the Group and US$25m (FY21: US$25m) for the UK parent company. We also report to the Audit and Risk committee any items that warrant reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\n## US$700m\n\n## (FY21: US$700m)\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole\n\n## US$455m\n\n## (FY21: US$525m)\n\nPerformance materiality for the Group financial statements\n\n## US$35m (FY21: US$35m)\n\n## Audit\n\nmisstatement posting threshold for the Group financial statements\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements was set at US$700m (FY21: US$700m) which compared to the following main Group financial statement caption amounts as follows:\n\n|      |                                   | Total Group revenue   | Group profit before  taxation   | Total Group assets   |\n|------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|\n| FY22 | Group financial statement caption | US$55,554m            | US$18,662m                      | US$96,744m           |\n| FY22 | Group materiality as % of caption | 1.3%                  | 3.8%                            | 0.7%                 |\n| FY21 | Group financial statement caption | US$63,495m            | US$30,833m                      | US$102,896m          |\n| FY21 | Group materiality as % of caption | 1.1%                  | 2.3%                            | 0.7%                 |",

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDITS\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow we determined the procedures to be performed across the Group:\n\nIn  order  to  determine  the  work  performed at a component, and after performing relevant risk assessment and planning procedures, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence in order to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 10% (FY21: 10%) of Total revenue or Total assets. We selected these metrics because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified four (FY21: four) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components.\n\nWe further identified three (FY21: three) components as significant due to risk of material misstatement associated to  revenue  and  one  (FY21:  three)  component  as  significant  due  to  risk  of  material  misstatement  associated  to provision for closedown, restoration, and environmental obligations. Of the four (FY21: six) components identified as significant due to risk, we performed full scope audits for two components (FY21: two), and performed audits of one or more account balances on two components (FY21: four).\n\nIn  addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the group financial statements as a whole,  we  selected  nine  (FY21:  ten)  components  on  which  to  perform  procedures.  Of  these  components,  we performed  full  scope  audits  for  three  components  (FY21:  two),  and  performed  audits  of  one  or  more  account balances on six components (FY21: eight).\n\n|                                        | Range of component                         | Number of components   (reflecting FY22 reporting structure)   | Number of components   (reflecting FY22 reporting structure)   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                        | materialities applied FY22                 | FY22                                                           | FY21                                                           |\n| Full scope audits                      | US$75m - US$425m (FY21: US$75m - US$425m)  | 9                                                              | 8                                                              |\n| Audits of one or more account balances | US$65m - US$150m  (FY21: US$54m - US$150m) | 8                                                              | 12                                                             |\n| Total                                  | Total                                      | 17                                                             | 20                                                             |\n\nCertain Group sales and purchase transactions that originate in various countries are processed in Singapore and Delhi respectively where we have established audit teams to perform testing on behalf of our component teams.

The work on 20 of the 21 in-scope components (FY21: 16 of the 17 components, reflecting FY22 reporting structure) was performed by KPMG member firms with the remaining component audited by a non-KPMG component auditor. In addition, we have performed Group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components. The audit of the UK parent company, Rio Tinto plc company financial statements was performed by the group audit team.\n\n## Approach on controls\n\nFor the audit of the Group financial statements, we were able to rely upon the Group's internal controls over financial reporting in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive. For the audit of the Rio Tinto plc company financial statements, the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive.\n\n## Group scope",

THE SCOPE OF OUR AUDIT (CONT'D)\n\n## What we mean\n\nThe extent of the Group audit team's involvement in component audits.\n\nIn working with component auditors, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Held planning calls with component audit teams to discuss the significant areas of the audit relevant to the components, including the key audit matters in respect of:\n- o Evaluation of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment in specific cash generating units; and\n- o Evaluation of specific provisions for close-down, restoration and environmental obligations ('closure provisions').\n- \u00b7 Issued group audit instructions to component auditors on the scope of their work, which included significant areas to be covered, relevant risks and the information to be reported back. The group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from US$65m to US$425m, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.\n- \u00b7 Held risk workshops with component audit teams before the commencement of the final phases of the audit.\n- \u00b7 As a part of determining and executing the audit plan and strategy, the group audit team physically visited various Rio Tinto sites, with the component audit teams in the current year, with restrictions in relation to COVID-19 lifted in most places. This was in addition to frequent video conference held throughout the audit where we discussed and challenged component teams' key observations, inspected key work papers related to significant risks and assessed the conclusions and consistencies between reported findings and work performed.\n\nSites visited along with our component auditors, where we also held meetings with relevant Rio Tinto personnel:\n\n| FY22                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sites visited  \u00b7 \u00b7 Pilbara operations  \u00b7 \u00b7 Oyu Tolgoi operations  \u00b7 \u00b7 Saguenay operations  \u00b7 \u00b7 Kennecott Utah operations  \u00b7 \u00b7 Weipa operations  \u00b7 \u00b7 Group  services  hub  in  Brisbane, Perth and Montreal | FY21  Delhi,  \u00b7 \u00b7 Pilbara operations  \u00b7 \u00b7 Perth (Southern Hemisphere Hub) |\n\n## 8.

RESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n## Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 250 of the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements, including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view in a ccordance with the relevant financial reporting frameworks; implementing such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the Group, Rio Tinto plc's and Rio Tinto Limited's ability to continue as a going concern and whether the use of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group, Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audits of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or other irregularities, or error, and to issue our opinions in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) or ASAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud, other irregularities or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA  fuller  description  of  KPMG  UK's  responsibilities  is  provided  on  the  FRC's  website  at  www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

For more information on the APMs used by the Group, including definitions and calculations, please refer to pages 273 to 278.\n\n- (a) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA and Capital expenditure are defined and calculated in note 1 from pages 161 to 163. Underlying Earnings is defined and calculated within the Alternative performance measures section on pages 274 and 275.\n- (b) Pilbara represents the Group's 100% holding in Hamersley, 50% holding in Hope Downs Joint Venture and 65% holding in Robe River Iron Associates. The Group's net beneficial interest in Robe River Iron Associates is 53%, as 30% is held through a 60% owned subsidiary and 35% is held through a 100% owned subsidiary.\n- (c) Segmental revenue, Underlying EBITDA, Underlying earnings and Operating assets within Evaluation projects/other include activities relating to the shipment and blending of Pilbara and Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC) iron ore inventories held at portside in China and sold to domestic customers. Transactions between Pilbara and our portside trading business are eliminated through the Iron Ore 'intra-segment' line and transactions between IOC and the portside trading business are eliminated through 'inter-segment transactions'.\n- (d) Until 16 December 2022, our interest in Oyu Tolgoi was held indirectly through our 50.8% investment in Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd (TRQ), where TRQ's principal asset was its 66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC, which owned the Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine. Following the purchase of TRQ we now directly hold a 66% investment in Oyu Tolgoi LLC.\n- (e) Simfer Jersey Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey, in which the Group has a 53% interest, has an 85% interest in Simfer S.A., the company that manages the Simandou project in Guinea. The Group therefore has a 45.05% indirect interest in Simfer S.A. These entities are consolidated as subsidiaries and together referred to as the Simandou iron ore project.\n- (f) Includes our interests in Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations (100%), QIT Madagascar Minerals (QMM, 80%) and Richards Bay Minerals (attributable interest of 74%).\n- (g) Includes our interests in Argyle (100%) residual operations which relates to the sale of remaining inventory and Diavik. Until 18 November 2021 we recognised our 60% share of assets, revenue and expenses relating to the Diavik joint venture. Liabilities were recognised according to Diavik Diamond Mine Inc's contractual obligations at 100%, with a corresponding 40% receivable or contingent asset representing the co-owner's share where applicable. Post acquisition, we now consolidate (100%) of the Diavik Diamond Mine. From 1 June 2021, management responsibility for rehabilitation of the Argyle site moved from Minerals to Rio Tinto Closure (RTC), hence the Argyle closure is reported in Other operations effective from 1 January 2021. Refer to (h).\n\n272\n\n- (h) Other operations include our 100% interest in the Gove alumina refinery (under rehabilitation), Rio Tinto Marine, and the remaining legacy liabilities of Rio Tinto Coal Australia. These include provisions for onerous contracts, in relation to rail infrastructure capacity, partly offset by financial assets and receivables relating to contingent royalties and disposal proceeds. From 16 June 2022, Commercial Treasury and related central costs are reported as part of 'Other operations' instead of 'Other items' in previous periods. We have not restated prior year balances as the impact was not significant. From 1 January 2021, Uranium moved from Minerals to Other operations and Argyle closure has been included in Other operations.\n- (i) Capital expenditure is the net cash outflow on purchases less sales of property, plant and equipment, capitalised evaluation costs and purchases less sales of other intangible assets as derived from the Group cash flow statement. The details provided include 100% of subsidiaries' capital expenditure and Rio Tinto's share of the capital expenditure of joint operations but exclude equity accounted units. We have adjusted the comparatives for this change in definition.\n- (j) Operating assets of the Group represents equity attributable to Rio Tinto adjusted for net (debt)/cash. Operating assets of subsidiaries, joint operations and the Group's share relating to equity accounted units are made up of net assets adjusted for net (debt)/cash and post-retirement assets and liabilities, net of tax. Operating assets are stated after the deduction of non-controlling interests; these are calculated by reference to the net assets of the relevant companies (i.e. inclusive of such companies' debt and amounts due to or from Rio Tinto Group companies).",

These APMs are used by management to assess the performance of the business and provide additional information, which investors may find useful. APMs are presented in order to give further insight into the underlying business performance of the Group's operations.\n\nAPMs are not consistently defined and calculated by all companies, including those in the Group's industry. Accordingly, these measures used by the Group may not be comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures made by other companies. Consequently, these APMs should not be regarded as a substitute for the IFRS measures and should be considered supplementary to those measures.\n\nThe following tables present the Group's key financial measures not defined according to IFRS and a reconciliation between those APMs and their nearest respective IFRS measures.\n\n## APMs derived from the income statement\n\nThe following income statement measures are used by the Group to provide greater understanding of the underlying business performance of its operations and to enhance comparability of reporting periods. They indicate the underlying commercial and operating performance of our assets including revenue generation, productivity and cost management.\n\n## Segmental revenue\n\nSegmental revenue includes consolidated sales revenue plus the equivalent sales revenue of equity accounted units in proportion to our equity interest (after adjusting for sales to/from subsidiaries). The reconciliation can be found in 'Our financial performance' on page 161.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA\n\nUnderlying EBITDA represents profit before tax, net finance items, depreciation and amortisation adjusted to exclude the EBITDA impact of items that do not reflect the underlying performance of  our reportable segments. The reconciliation of profit after tax to underlying EBITDA can be found in 'Our financial performance' on page 163.\n\n## Underlying EBITDA margin\n\nUnderlying EBITDA margin is defined as Group underlying EBITDA divided by the aggregate of consolidated sales revenue and our share of equity account unit sales after eliminations.\n\n|                                                                                                    | 2022 US$m   | 2021  US$m   | 2020  US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Underlying EBITDA                                                                                  | 26,272      | 37,720       | 23,902       |\n| Consolidated sales revenue                                                                         | 55,554      | 63,495       | 44,611       |\n| Share of equity accounted unit sales and inter-subsidiary/equity accounted unit sales eliminations | 2,850       | 3,073        | 2,407        |\n|                                                                                                    | 58,404      | 66,568       | 47,018       |\n| Underlying EBITDA margin                                                                           | 45 %        | 5 7   %      | 5 1   %      |\n\n## Pilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin\n\nThe Pilbara underlying free on board (FOB) EBITDA margin is defined as Pilbara underlying EBITDA divided by Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue .\n\n|                                                      | 2022 US$m   | 2021  US$m   | 2020  US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Pilbara                                              |             |              |              |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                    | 18,474      | 27,837       | 18,896       |\n| Pilbara segmental revenue                            | 29,313      | 39,111       | 27,027       |\n| Less: Freight revenue                                | (2,206)     | (2,707)      | (1,487)      |\n| Pilbara segmental revenue, excluding freight revenue | 27,107      | 36,404       | 25,540       |\n| Pilbara underlying FOB EBITDA margin                 | 6 8   %     | 7 6   %      | 7 4   %      |\n\n273",

It represents the number of times finance income and finance costs (including amounts capitalised) are covered by profit before taxation before finance income, finance costs, share of profit after tax of equity accounted units and items excluded from underlying earnings, plus dividends from equity accounted units.\n\n|                                                     | 2022 US$m   | 2021  US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Profit before taxation                              | 18,662      | 30,833       |\n| Add back                                            |             |              |\n| Finance income                                      | (179)       | (64)         |\n| Finance costs                                       | 335         | 243          |\n| Share of profit after tax of equity accounted units | (777)       | (1,042)      |\n| Items excluded from underlying earnings             | (49)        | 508          |\n| Add: Dividends from equity accounted units          | 879         | 1,431        |\n| Calculated earnings                                 | 18,871      | 31,909       |\n| Finance income                                      | 179         | 64           |\n| Finance costs                                       | (335)       | (243)        |\n| Add: Amounts capitalised                            | (416)       | (358)        |\n| Total finance income/costs before capitalisation    | (572)       | (537)        |\n| Interest cover                                      | 33          | 59           |\n\n## Payout ratio\n\nThe payout ratio is used by us to guide the dividend policy we implemented in 2016, under which we have sought to return 40-60% of underlying earnings, on average through the cycle to shareholders as dividends. It is calculated as total equity dividends per share to owners of Rio Tinto declared in respect of the financial year divided by underlying earnings per share (as defined above). Dividends declared usually include an interim dividend paid in the year, and a final dividend paid after the end of the year. Any special dividends declared in respect of the financial year are also included.\n\n|                                                | 2022 (cents)   | 2021  (cents)   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Interim dividend declared per share            | 267.0          | 376.0           |\n| Interim special dividend declared per share    | -              | 185.0           |\n| Final dividend declared per share              | 225.0          | 417.0           |\n| Final special dividend declared per share      | -              | 62.0            |\n| Total dividend declared per share for the year | 492.0          | 1,040.0         |\n| Underlying earnings per share                  | 819.6          | 1,321.1         |\n| Payout ratio                                   | 60 %           | 7 9   %         |\n\n276",

        "page_content": "## APMs derived from cash flow statement\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure includes the net sustaining and development expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and on intangible assets. This is equivalent to 'Purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets' in the cash flow statement less 'Sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets'.\n\nThis measure is used to support management's objective of effective and efficient capital allocation as we need to invest in existing assets in order to maintain and improve productive capacity, and in new assets to grow the business.\n\n## Rio Tinto share of capital investment\n\nRio Tinto's share of capital investment represents the Group's economic investment in capital projects. It has been newly introduced during the year to better represent the Group's share of funding for capital projects which are jointly funded with other shareholders and which may differ from the consolidated basis included in the Capital expenditure APM. This better reflects the Group's approach to capital allocation.\n\nThe measure is based upon the Capital expenditure APM, adjusted to deduct equity or shareholder loan financing provided to partially owned subsidiaries by non-controlling interests in respect of major capital projects in the period. Where funding which would otherwise be provided directly by shareholders is replaced with project financing, an adjustment is also made to deduct the share of project financing attributable to the noncontrolling interest. This adjustment is not made in cases where Rio Tinto has unilaterally guaranteed this project financing. Lastly, funding contributed by the Group to Equity Accounted Units for its share of investment in their major capital projects is added to the measure. No adjustment is made to the Capital expenditure APM where capital expenditure is funded from the operating cash flows of the subsidiary or Equity Accounted Unit.\n\nIn the current and prior years the Capital expenditure APM and Rio Tinto share of capital investment are identical.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash generated from operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangibles and payments of lease principal, plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThis measures the net cash returned by the business after the expenditure of sustaining and development capital. This cash can be used for shareholder returns, reducing debt and other investing/financing activities.\n\n|                                                                       | 2022 US$m   | 2021  US$m   | 2020  US$m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Net cash generated from operating activities                          | 16,134      | 25,345       | 15,875       |\n| Less: Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets | (6,750)     | (7,384)      | (6,189)      |\n| Less: Lease principal payments                                        | (374)       | (358)        | (324)        |\n| Add: Sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets     | -           | 61           | 45           |\n| Free cash flow                                                        | 9,010       | 17,664       | 9,407        |\n\n277",

Production figures are sometimes more precise than the rounded numbers shown, hence small differences may result from calculation of Rio Tinto share of production. The Argyle diamond mine closed on 3 November 2020. Production is included up to that date.\n\n- 1. Rio Tinto percentage share, shown above, is as at 31 December 2022. The footnotes below include all ownership changes over the three years.\n- 2.  Jonqui\u00e8re's (Vaudreuil) production shows smelter grade alumina only and excludes hydrate produced and used for specialty alumina.\n- 3.  Rio Tinto has a 22.95% shareholding in the Sangar\u00e9di mine, but benefits from 45% of production.\n- 4.  Borate quantities are expressed as B2O3.\n- 5.  Production data in the table represents 33.52% ownership in Oyu Tolgoi. On 16 December 2022, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, increasing our ownership in Oyu Tolgoi from 33.52% to 66%. From 1 January 2023, our share of production will be updated to reflect this change. We will also separately report production from open pit and underground operations.\n- 6.  On 17 November 2021, our ownership interest in Diavik increased from 60% to 100%. Production from 1 November 2021 is reported including this change.\n- 7.  Includes 100% of production from Paraburdoo, Mount Tom Price, Western Turner Syncline, Marandoo, Yandicoogina, Brockman, Nammuldi, Silvergrass, Channar, Gudai-Darri and the Eastern Range mines. While we own 54% of the Eastern Range mine, under the terms of the joint venture agreement, Hamersley Iron manages the operation and is obliged to purchase all mine production from the joint venture and, therefore, all of the production is included in Rio Tinto's share of production. Our ownership interest in Channar mine increased from 60% to 100%, following conclusion of its joint venture with Sinosteel Corporation upon reaching planned 290 million tonnes production on 22 October 2020.\n- 8.  Quantities comprise 100% of Rio Tinto Iron and Titanium Quebec Operations and our 74% share of Richards Bay Minerals' production. Ilmenite mined in Madagascar is processed in Canada.\n- 9.  Energy Resources of Australia (ERA) reports drummed U3O8. ERA ceased processing operations on 8 January 2021, as required by the Ranger Authority. In February 2020, our interest in ERA increased from 68.4% to 86.3% as a result of new ERA shares issued to Rio Tinto under the Entitlement Offer and Underwriting Agreement to raise funds for the rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area. Production is reported including this change from 1 March 2020.",

        "page_content": "## Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Rio Tinto managed operations are reported in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, 2012 edition (the JORC Code), as required by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Rio Tinto also files an annual report on Form 20-F (Form 20-F) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prepares the Form 20-F Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (Regulation S-K). Mineral Reserves under Regulation S-K are the equivalent of Ore Reserves under ASX. Some variations may occur between the reporting in accordance with the JORC Code and Regulation S-K.\n\nA Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade (or quality) and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Estimates of such material are based largely on geological information with only preliminary consideration of mining, economic and other factors. While in the judgment of the Competent Person there are realistic expectations that all or part of the Mineral Resources will eventually become Proved or Probable Ore Reserves, there is no guarantee that this will occur, as the result depends on further technical and economic studies and prevailing economic conditions in the future.\n\nAn Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted. It is defined by studies at pre-feasibility or feasibility level as appropriate, with the application of modifying factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction can reasonably be justified.\n\nRio Tinto's Mineral Resources are reported as additional (exclusive) to the reported Ore Reserves.\n\nFor Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve reporting, the JORC Code envisages the use of reasonable investment assumptions to test the economic viability of the Ore Reserves and the reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction for the Mineral Resources. To achieve this, Rio Tinto uses internally generated, projected long-term commodity prices.\n\nRegulation S-K requires the use of a justifiable commodity price to test the economic viability of the Mineral Reserves and the reasonable prospects of economic extraction for the Mineral Resources, and prices used in calculating the estimates must be disclosed. As a result of the commercial sensitivity of Rio Tinto's long-term commodity prices, Rio Tinto uses commercially available consensus pricing or historical pricing for SEC reporting. For this reason and others, some Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves reported to the SEC in the Form 20-F may differ from those Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves reported below.\n\nMineral Resource and Ore Reserve information in the following tables is based on information compiled by Competent Persons (as defined by the JORC Code), most of whom are full-time employees of Rio Tinto or related companies. Each has had a minimum of five years' relevant experience and is a member of a recognised professional body whose members are bound by a professional code of ethics. These bodies include the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM), Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) or recognised professional organisations (RPO). Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this Annual Report of information they have provided in the form and context in which it appears. Competent Persons responsible for the estimates are listed on page 307, by operation, along with their professional affiliation, employer, and accountability for Mineral Resources and/or Ore Reserves.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves from externally managed operations, in which Rio Tinto holds a minority share, are reported as received from the managing entity and in accordance with the JORC Code.\n\nMineral Resources and Ore Reserves from our managed operations are the responsibility of the managing directors of the business units and estimates are carried out by the Competent Persons.\n\nThe Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve figures in the following tables are as of 31 December 2022. Summary data for year end 2021 are shown for comparison. Metric units are used throughout. The figures used to calculate Rio Tinto's Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are more precise than the rounded numbers shown in the tables, hence small differences might result if the calculations are repeated using the tabulated figures.\n\nJORC Table 1 reports for new or materially changed significant deposits are released to the market; they are also available at riotinto.com. JORC Table 1, SEC Technical Report Summaries and NI 43-101 technical reports generated by non-managed units or joint venture partners are referenced within the reporting footnotes, with the location and initial reporting date identified.",

Type of mine: O/P = open pit/surface.\n- 2.  Ore Reserves of iron ore are shown as recoverable Ore Reserves of marketable product after accounting for all mining and processing losses. Mill recoveries are therefore not shown.\n- 3.  Australian iron ore Ore Reserve tonnes are reported on a dry weight basis.\n- 4.  Australian iron ore Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases. Prior to mining, state government approvals (including environmental and heritage) are required. Reported Ore Reserves include select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding. In these areas, it is expected that these approvals will be obtained within the timeframes required in the current production schedule.\n- 5.  Ore Reserves of Brockman Ore are 87.4% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Bao-HI joint venture and the Hope Downs joint venture.\n- 6.  Ore Reserves of Marra Mamba Ore are 79.7% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Hope Downs joint venture and the Robe River joint venture.\n- 7.  Ore Reserves of Pisolite Ore are 80.6% Rio Tinto-owned, with the remainder split between the non-Rio Tinto partners in the Robe River joint venture.\n- 8.  Iron Ore Company of Canada Ore Reserves are reported as marketable product (57% pellets and 43% concentrate for sale) at a natural moisture content of 2%. The marketable product is derived from mined material comprising 675 million dry tonnes at 38% iron, 35% silica, 0.2% alumina, 0.024% phosphorus (Proved) and 401 million dry tonnes at 38% iron, 35% silica, 0.22% alumina, 0.02% phosphorus (Probable) using process-recovery factors derived from current IOC concentrating and pellet operations. No meaningful relationship has been established between the product and feed grades of alumina and phosphorus, so these grades cannot be reported for Ore Reserves. Saleable product is produced to meet silica grade specifications, so the Ore Reserve silica grade is the targeted silica grade for the currently anticipated long-term product mix. Loss on ignition (LOI) is not determined for resource drilling samples, so no estimate of % LOI is available for Ore Reserves.\n\n<!-- image -->",

of the joint venture agreement between Rio Tinto (54%) and China Baowu Steel Group Corp. Ltd (46%) to develop the Western Range iron ore project as reported to the market in on 14 September 2022. A JORC Table 1 in support of this change was released to the market and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\nOre Reserve updates to Brockman Ore and Marra Mamba Ore include mining depletion, the addition of new deposits, primarily Bedded Hilltop and Hope Downs 2, changes to cut-off grades and reclassification of select deposits to Mineral Resources. Through engagement with the Traditional Owners, approximately 14 million tonnes of material has been removed from the Ore Reserve estimate (Brockman, Marra Mamba and Pisolite), primarily from Gudai-Darri.\n\nOre Reserve classification is determined based on confidence in all the modifying factors. Generally, Proved Ore Reserves are derived from Measured Mineral Resources and Probable Ore Reserves are derived from Indicated Mineral Resources. In 2022, portions of the Ore Reserve derived from Measured Mineral Resources have been classified as Probable Ore Reserves. This classification primarily represents areas where one or more state government approvals remain outstanding or specific Traditional Owner engagement is required prior to mining.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We released an initial Probable Ore Reserve of 1.7 million tonnes at 1.9% copper, 0.71 g/t gold, 10.07 g/t silver, and 0.044% molybdenum to the market by Rio Tinto on 27 September 2022, with a supporting JORC Table 1. This can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi\n\nAs reported to the market on 16 December 2022, we completed our acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd and the Rio Tinto interest percentage reflects this change.\n\nThe Hugo Dummett North underground mine is currently under construction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

classification for the Zulti South project from Proved to Probable. The change results from schedule delays, due to community and social complexity. A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Type of mine: O/P = open pit/surface, U/G = underground.\n- 2.  Ore Reserves of borates are expressed in terms of marketable product (B2O3) tonnes after all mining and processing losses.\n- 3.  Ore Reserves of diamonds are shown as recoverable Ore Reserves of marketable product after accounting for all mining and processing losses. Mill recoveries are therefore not shown.\n- 4.  Diavik Ore Reserves are based on a nominal 1 millimetre lower cut-off size and a final re-crushing size of 6 millimetres.\n\n<!-- image -->",

geological model and updated economic assumptions. A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\n## Bingham Canyon\n\nOpen Pit Mineral Resource tonnes decreased following conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves following completion of the pre-feasibility study for the Apex cutback, partially offset by updates to modifying factors. A JORC Table 1 in support of this change will be released to the market contemporaneously with the release of this Annual Report and can be viewed at riotinto.com/resourcesandreserves.\n\nUnderground Skarns Mineral Resources represent the combined Mineral Resources from the various underground deposits at Bingham Canyon. Mineral Resource tonnes increased due to reporting of Mineral Resources for the Lower Commercial Skarns (LCS). The initial LCS Mineral Resource of 7.5 million tonnes at 1.9% copper, 0.84 g/t gold, 11.26 g/t silver, and 0.015% molybdenum was released to the market by Rio Tinto on 27 September 2022 with a supporting JORC Table 1 and can be viewed at riotinto. com/invest/financial-news-performance/resources-and-reserves.\n\n## Resolution\n\nMineral Resources includes silver as a byproduct for the first time, based upon updated modelling.\n\n## Oyu Tolgoi\n\nAs reported to the market on 16 December 2022, Rio Tinto completed its acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd and the Rio Tinto interest percentage reflects this change.\n\nThe Hugo Dummett North underground mine is currently under construction.",

Reserves due to A21 underground mining approval.\n\n## Jabiluka (Energy Resources of Australia)\n\nBased on Rio Tinto's assessment that the deposit does not currently have reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction, as required under the JORC Code for reporting of a Mineral Resource, given the Mirarr people's publicly stated opposition to further mining and the operation of ERA's Long Term Care and Maintenance Agreement, Rio Tinto has therefore decided to no longer report a Mineral Resource for Jabiluka.",

This includes an annual review of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at a Group level, as well as a review of findings and progress from the Group Internal Audit programme.\n\n## Ore Reserves Steering Committee\n\nThe Ore Reserves Steering Committee (ORSC), chaired by the Chief Technical Officer, Development & Technology, meets at least quarterly. The ORSC comprises senior representatives across our technical, financial, governance and business groups, and oversees the appointment of Competent Persons nominated by the business units; reviews Exploration Results, Mineral Resource or Ore Reserve data prior to public reporting; and oversees the development of the Group Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards and guidance.\n\n## Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence\n\nThe Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence contains a dedicated Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance team. Orebody Knowledge Technical Assurance, in conjunction with the ORSC, is the guardian and author of Group Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve standards and guidance, and is responsible for the governance and compilation of Group Mineral Resource, Ore Reserve and reconciliation reporting. The Technical Assurance team also monitors the external reporting environment, facilitates internal audits and monitors actions with Group Internal Audit.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nMineral Resource and Ore Reserve internal audits are conducted by independent external consulting personnel in a programme managed by Group Internal Audit, with the assistance of the Orebody Knowledge Centre of Excellence and the ORSC. Material findings are reported outside of the product group reporting line to the Audit Committee, and all reports and action plans are reviewed by the ORSC for alignment to internal and external reporting standards.\n\nDuring 2022, two internal Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve audits were completed.\n\n## Geoscientific information management and assurance\n\nWe employ industry-standard drilling, sampling, assaying and quality assurance/ quality control (QA/QC) practices supported by formally documented procedures.\n\nDiamond core and reverse circulation are our primary drilling methods. We use other methods such as sonic and air core if appropriate for the style of deposit. Drill hole locations are typically confirmed by highprecision differential Global Positioning System (GPS) and down-hole trace positioning is primarily achieved by gyroscopic survey.\n\nDrill sample recovery is typically recorded, and all geological data is collected by qualified geoscientific professionals. Geological logging consistency is secured via formal logging procedures and training, reference materials, application of geological code libraries and digital logging directly to the geological database.\n\nOn-site or commercial laboratories provide appropriate analytical (assaying) techniques, according to the commodity and style of deposit. Reliability of assay data is maintained via QA/QC procedures, which monitor assay accuracy and precision through the analysis of blanks, sample duplicates and matrix-matched certified reference materials.\n\nOur geoscientific information management standard is the industry-leading acQuire system and we employ strict QA/QC criteria to ensure only high-quality assay data is uploaded to a project's database.\n\n## Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve risk management\n\nRisks to our Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are managed through comprehensive risk assessments undertaken in support of the annual reporting cycle. Risks are identified and managed by verifying controls, determining and undertaking suitable actions to remove or reduce the risk, conducting reviews, and maintaining compliance with standards and procedures. Risks are managed through a commercial risk management solution.\n\nAt the end of each reporting cycle, we analyse the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve risks across all business units to ensure both consistency of reporting and determine any Group-wide risks to the various processes.",

In accordance with the Standards we have:\n\n- \uf0a7 used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \uf0a7 used our professional judgement to assess the risk of material misstatement and plan and perform the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance that the GHG Emissions is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \uf0a7 considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their effectiveness; and\n- \uf0a7 ensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.\n\n## Summary of Procedures Performed\n\nIn gathering evidence for our conclusions, our assurance procedures comprised:\n\n- \uf0a7 enquiries with relevant Rio Tinto personnel to understand and evaluate the design and implementation of the key systems, processes and internal controls to capture, collate, calculate and report the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;\n- \uf0a7 assessment of the suitability and application of the Reporting Criteria in respect of the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;\n- \uf0a7 analytical procedures over the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;\n- \uf0a7 risk analysis to validate the completeness of Rio Tinto's materiality assessment;\n- \uf0a7 substantively tested performance data within the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance, on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing a selection of 6 operations being Weipa, Winu, West Angelas, Kitimat, Iron Ore Company of Canada and Borates - RTM California Operations;\n- \uf0a7 substantively tested the GHG Emissions, on a sample basis at corporate and operational level, which included testing a selection of 15 operations being Weipa, Winu, Gladstone Power Station, Pilbara Rail Operations, Brockman, Yandicoogina, Marandoo, Boyne Smelters Limited,  Tomago,  Alouette,  IOC  Processing  Plant,  Queensland  Alumina  Limited,  RTFT  Smelting,  Yarwun  and  Sohar,  and  how  this information is reported and captured at corporate level;\n- \uf0a7 interviews and walkthroughs with site personnel at each of the 15 operations listed above to assess the key systems, processes and internal controls to capture, collate, calculate and report GHG Emissions at an operational level, and how this information is reported and captured at corporate level;\n- \uf0a7 testing the mathematical accuracy of a sample of calculations underlying the GHG Emissions;\n- \uf0a7 assessing the appropriateness of a sample of emissions factors applied in calculating the GHG Emissions;\n- \uf0a7 evaluating the design and effectiveness of controls implemented by the Rio Tinto Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Services reporting function over the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions;\n- \uf0a7 assessing Rio Tinto's incorporation of the requirements of the ICMM 10 Principles for sustainable development, and the mandatory requirements set out in the ICMM Position Statements, into its own policies, strategies and standards; and\n- \uf0a7 reviewing the Rio Tinto Annual Report 2022, the Rio Tinto Strategic Report 2022 and the Rio Tinto Sustainability Fact Book 2022 in their entirety to ensure they are consistent with our overall knowledge of Rio Tinto.\n\n## How the Standard Defines Limited Assurance, Reasonable Assurance and Material Misstatement\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that it will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\n\nMisstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of the Directors of Rio Tinto.\n\n## Use of this Assurance Report\n\nThis report has been prepared for the Directors of Rio Tinto for the purpose of providing assurance conclusions on the Sustainability Information Subject to Assurance and GHG Emissions and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of Rio Tinto, or for any other purpose than that for which it was prepared.\n\n\u00a92023 KPMG, an Australian partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

In general, where we have provided financial data in other currencies, it has been translated from the consolidated financial statements, and is provided solely for convenience; exceptions arise where data has been extracted directly from source records.\n\n## History\n\nRio Tinto plc was incorporated on 30 March 1962, then called The Rio Tinto-Zinc Corporation Limited (RTZ), and was formed by the merger of The Rio Tinto Company Limited and The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited. The Rio Tinto Company was incorporated in 1873 to reopen ancient copper workings in Spain. The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited began operations in the early twentieth century as part of the Australian mining industry. Based at Broken Hill in New South Wales, it began mining silver, lead and zinc deposits and later expanded into lead and zinc smelting.\n\nRio Tinto Limited was incorporated on 17 December 1959, then called The Rio Tinto Mining Company of Australia Pty Limited. In 1962 the Australian interests of The Consolidated Zinc Corporation Limited and The Rio Tinto Company Limited were merged to form Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited, a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia. In 1980, Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited changed its name to CRA Limited.\n\nBetween 1962 and 1995, both RTZ and CRA discovered important mineral deposits, developed major mining projects and grew through acquisition.\n\nRTZ and CRA began operating in 1995 through a dual-listed companies structure. In 1997, RTZ became Rio Tinto plc and CRA became Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Dual-listed companies structure\n\nIn 1995, Rio Tinto shareholders approved the terms of the dual-listed companies' merger (the DLC structure). The aim was to put shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position they would be in if they held shares in a single entity owning all assets of both companies.\n\nFollowing the approval of the DLC structure, both companies entered into a DLC Merger Sharing Agreement (the Sharing Agreement). As part of this, both companies agreed to be managed in a unified way, to share the same Board of Directors, and to put in place arrangements to provide shareholders of both companies with a common economic interest in the DLC structure.\n\nTo achieve this third objective, the Sharing Agreement fixed the ratio of dividend, voting and capital distribution rights attached to each Rio Tinto plc share and each Rio Tinto Limited share at an Equalisation Ratio of 1:1. This has remained unchanged ever since, although the Sharing Agreement makes clear this can be revised in special circumstances, for example where certain modifications are made to the share capital of one company (such as rights issues, bonus issues, share splits and share consolidations) but not to the other.\n\nOutside the circumstances specified in the Sharing Agreement, the Equalisation Ratio can only be altered with the approval of shareholders under the class rights action approval procedure, described in the Voting arrangements section below. Any adjustments must be confirmed by the Group's external auditors.\n\nConsistent with the DLC structure, the directors of both companies aim to act in the best interests of Rio Tinto as a whole. The class rights action approval procedure exists to deal with instances where there may be a conflict of interest between the shareholders of the two companies.\n\nTo ensure that the Boards of both companies are identical, resolutions to appoint or remove Directors must be put to shareholders of both companies as Joint Decisions, described in the Voting arrangements section below. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited make clear that a person can only be a Director of one company if he or she is also a Director of the other. This means that if a person were removed as a Director of Rio Tinto plc, he or she would also cease to be a Director of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nOne consequence of the DLC merger is that Rio Tinto is subject to a wide range of laws, rules and regulatory reviews across multiple jurisdictions. Where these rules differ, Rio Tinto will comply with the requirements in each jurisdiction at a minimum.\n\n## Dividend arrangements\n\nThe Sharing Agreement ensures that dividends paid on Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited shares are equalised on a net cash basis without taking into account any associated tax credits. Dividends are determined in US dollars (with the exception of ADR holders, paid in sterling and Australian dollars) and both companies are required to announce and pay dividends and other distributions or as close to at the same time as possible.\n\nThe payment of dividends between companies and their subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends on the DLC dividend shares, provides the Group with flexibility to manage internal funds and distributable reserves to enable the payment of equalised dividend or equalised capital distributions.\n\nIf the payment of an equalised dividend would contravene the law applicable to one of the companies, they can depart from the Equalisation Ratio. In that situation, the relevant company must put aside reserves for payment on the relevant shares at a later date.\n\nRio Tinto shareholders have no direct rights to enforce the dividend equalisation provisions of the Sharing Agreement.\n\n## Voting arrangements\n\nIn principle, the Sharing Agreement enables the shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited to vote as a joint electorate on any matters that affect them in similar ways. These are referred to as Joint Decisions, and include the creation of new classes of share capital, the appointment or removal of directors and auditors, and the receiving of annual financial statements. All shareholder resolutions that include Joint Decisions are voted on a poll.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement also protects shareholders of both companies by requiring joint approval for decisions that do not affect the shareholders of both companies equally. These are known as class rights actions, and are voted on a poll. For example, fundamental elements of the DLC structure cannot be changed unless approved separately by the shareholders of both companies.",

        "page_content": "Exceptions to these principles can arise in situations such as where legislation requires the separate approval of a decision by the appropriate majority of shareholders in one company, and where approval of the matter by shareholders of the other company is not required.\n\nWhere a matter has been expressly categorised as either a Joint Decision or a class rights action, the directors cannot change that categorisation. If a matter falls within both categories, it is treated as a class rights action. In addition, if an issue is not expressly listed in either category, Directors can decide how it should be put to shareholders for approval.\n\nTo support joint voting arrangements, both companies have entered into shareholder voting agreements, where a Special Voting Share is issued to a special purpose company (SVC) and held in trust for shareholders by a common trustee. Rio Tinto plc (RTP) has issued its Special Voting Share (RTP Special Voting Share) to Rio Tinto Limited (RTL) Shareholder SVC, while Rio Tinto Limited has issued its Special Voting Share (RTL Special Voting Share) to RTP Shareholder SVC. The total number of votes cast on Joint Decisions by the shareholders of one company are decided at a parallel meeting of the other company. The exact role of these SVCs is described below.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, certain shareholders can be excluded from voting at their respective company's general meetings. For example, they may have acquired shares in the other company in excess of a given threshold without making an offer for all the shares in the other company. In this situation, votes cast by these excluded shareholders are disregarded.\n\nFollowing the companies' general meetings, the overall results of the voting are announced to relevant stock exchanges and the media, and published at riotinto.com.\n\nAt a Rio Tinto plc shareholders meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio Tinto plc share carries one vote. The holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto Limited in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast by public shareholders for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto Limited shareholders' meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto Limited ordinary shares do not hold voting shares in Rio Tinto plc by virtue of their holding in Rio Tinto Limited, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\nSimilarly, at a Rio Tinto Limited shareholders meeting during which a Joint Decision is considered, each Rio Tinto Limited share carries one vote and the holder of its Special Voting Share will have one vote for each vote cast by the public shareholders of Rio Tinto plc in their parallel meeting. The holder of the Special Voting Share must vote in accordance with the votes cast for and against the equivalent resolution at the parallel Rio Tinto plc shareholders meeting. The holders of Rio Tinto plc ordinary shares do not hold any voting shares in Rio Tinto Limited by virtue of their\n\nholding in Rio Tinto plc, and cannot enforce the voting arrangements relating to the Special Voting Share.\n\n## Capital distribution arrangements\n\nIf either company goes into liquidation, the Sharing Agreement ensures a valuation is made of the surplus assets of both companies. If the surplus assets available for distribution by one company on each of the shares held by its shareholders exceed the surplus assets available for distribution by the other company on each of the shares held by its shareholders, then an equalising payment must be made - to the extent permitted by applicable law - such that the amount available for distribution on each share held by shareholders of both companies reflects the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe aim is to ensure the shareholders of both companies have equivalent entitlements to the assets of the combined Group on a per share basis, taking account of the Equalisation Ratio.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement does not grant any enforceable rights to the shareholders of either company upon liquidation of either company.\n\n## Limitations on ownership of shares and merger obligations\n\nThe laws and regulations of the UK and Australia impose restrictions and obligations on persons who control interests in publicly listed companies in excess of defined thresholds. These can include an obligation to make a public offer for all outstanding issued shares of the relevant company. The threshold applicable to Rio Tinto plc under UK law and regulations is 30% and to Rio Tinto Limited under Australian law and regulations is 20% on both a standalone and a Joint Decision basis.\n\nAs part of the DLC merger, the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited were amended with the aim of extending these laws and regulations to the combined enterprise. This amendment also ensures that a person cannot exercise control over one company without having made offers to the public shareholders of both companies.\n\nThis guarantees the equal treatment of both sets of shareholders, and that the two companies are considered as a single economic entity. The Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited impose restrictions on any person who controls, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the votes on a Joint Decision. If, however, such a person has an interest in either Rio Tinto Limited or Rio Tinto plc only, then the restrictions only apply if they control, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of the votes at that company's general meetings.\n\nIf one of these thresholds is exceeded, the person cannot attend or vote at general meetings of the relevant company, cannot receive dividends or other distributions from the relevant company, and may be divested of their interest by the directors of the relevant company (subject to certain limited exceptions and notification by the relevant company). These restrictions continue to apply until that person has either made a public offer for all the publicly held shares of the other company, has reduced their controlling interest below the\n\nthresholds specified, or has acquired through a permitted means at least 50% of the publicly held shares of each company.\n\nThis arrangement ensures that offers for the publicly held shares of both companies would be required to avoid the restrictions set out above, even if the interests which breach the thresholds are held in just one of the companies. The Directors do not have the discretion to exempt a person from the operation of these rules.\n\nUnder the Sharing Agreement, the companies agree to co-operate to enforce the above restrictions contained in their Articles of Association and Constitution.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nIn 1995, each company entered into a deed poll guarantee in favour of creditors of the other company. In addition, each company guaranteed the contractual obligations of the other and the obligations of other persons guaranteed by the other company, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n\nBeneficiaries under deed poll guarantees can make demands on the relevant guarantor without first having recourse to the company or persons whose obligations are being guaranteed. The obligations of the guarantor under each deed poll guarantee expire upon termination of the Sharing Agreement and under other limited circumstances, but only in respect of obligations arising after such termination and, in the case of other limited circumstances, the publication and expiry of due notice.\n\n## Markets\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\nThe principal market for Rio Tinto plc shares is the London Stock Exchange, with shares trading through the Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service (SETS) system.\n\nRio Tinto plc American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFurther details relating to Rio Tinto plc ADRs are available in Rio Tinto's annual reports on Form 20-F.\n\n## Rio Tinto Limited\n\nRio Tinto Limited shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).\n\nThe ASX is the principal trading market for Rio Tinto Limited shares. The ASX is a national stock exchange with an automated trading system.",

        "page_content": "## Material contracts\n\n## Articles of Association, Constitution, and DLC Sharing Agreement\n\nAs explained on page 338, under the terms of the DLC structure shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and of Rio Tinto Limited entered into certain contractual arrangements designed to place the shareholders of both companies in substantially the same position as if they held shares in a single entity that owned all the assets of both companies. As far as is permitted by the UK Companies Act 2006 , the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and ASX Listing Rules, this principle is reflected in the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc and in the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited.\n\nThe following summaries describe the material rights of shareholders of both Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited.\n\n## Objects\n\nAt the 2009 AGMs, shareholders of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited approved amendments to their Articles of Association and Constitution whereby the object clauses were removed to allow the companies to have the widest possible scope of activities.\n\n## Directors' interests\n\nUnder Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association, a Director may not vote in respect of any proposal in which he or she, or any other person connected with him or her, has any interest, other than by virtue of his or her interests in shares or debentures or other securities of, in or through the company, except in certain circumstances, including in respect of resolutions:\n\n- - Indemnifying him or her or a third party in respect of obligations incurred by the Director on behalf of, or for the benefit of, the company, or in respect of obligations of the company, for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an indemnity, security or guarantee.\n- - Relating to an offer of securities in which he or she may be interested as a holder of securities or as an underwriter.\n- - Concerning another body corporate in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate.\n- - Relating to an employee benefit in which the Director will share equally with other employees.\n- - Relating to liability insurance that the company is empowered to purchase for the benefit of Directors of the company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (or officers) of the company.\n- - Concerning the giving of indemnities in favour of Directors or the funding of expenditure by Directors to defend criminal, civil or regulatory proceedings or actions against a Director.\n\nUnder Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, a Director may be present at a meeting of the Board while a matter in which the Director has a material personal interest is being considered and may vote in respect of that matter, except where a Director is constrained by Australian law.\n\nThe Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the companies to borrow money; to charge any property or business of the companies or all, or any, of their uncalled capital; and to issue debentures or give any other security for a debt, liability or obligation of the companies or of any other person. The Directors shall restrict the borrowings of Rio Tinto plc to the limitation that the aggregate amount of all monies borrowed by the company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed an amount equal to 1.5 times the companies' share capital plus aggregate reserves unless sanctioned by an ordinary resolution of the company.\n\nDirectors are not required to hold any shares of either company by way of qualification. The Remuneration Report on pages 110-135 provides information on shareholding policies relating to Executive and Non-Executive Directors. Please refer to the Directors' Report for information on the appointment of Directors.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares\n\nUnder UK law, dividends on shares may only be paid out of profits available for distribution, as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and by the relevant law. Shareholders are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by the Directors. Directors may also pay interim dividends to shareholders as justified by the financial position of the Group.\n\nUnder the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , dividends on shares may only be paid if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared, the excess is sufficient for the payment of the dividend, the payment is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole, and the payment does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors. Any Rio Tinto plc dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and returned to the company. Any Rio Tinto Limited dividend unclaimed may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of the company until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to Australian law. Rio Tinto Limited is governed by the State of Victoria's unclaimed monies legislation, which requires the company to pay to the state revenue office any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that on 1 March each year have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.\n\n## Voting\n\nVoting at any general meeting of shareholders on a resolution on which the holder of the Special Voting Share is entitled to vote shall be decided by a poll, and any other resolution shall be decided by a show of hands unless a poll has been duly demanded. On a show of hands, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. The holder of the Special Voting Share is not entitled to vote in a show of hands. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or other duly authorised representative) and is entitled to vote, has one vote for every ordinary share for which he or she is the holder. In the case of Joint Decisions, the holder of the Special Voting Share has one vote for each vote cast in respect of the publicly held shares of the other company.\n\nA poll may be demanded by any of the following:\n\n- - The Chair of the meeting.\n- - At least five shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\n- - Any shareholder(s) representing in the aggregate not less than one tenth (Rio Tinto plc) or one 20 th (Rio Tinto Limited) of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote on the resolution.\n- - Any shareholder(s) holding Rio Tinto plc shares conferring a right to vote at the meeting on which there have been paid-up sums in the aggregate equal to not less than one tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.\n- - The holder of the Special Voting Share of either company.\n\nA proxy form gives the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one.\n\nThe necessary quorum for a Rio Tinto plc general meeting is three members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative) and entitled to vote. For a Rio Tinto Limited general meeting it is two members present (in person or by proxy or other duly authorised representative).\n\nMatters are transacted at general meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions as:\n\n- - Ordinary resolutions (for example the election of Directors), which require the affirmative vote of a majority of persons voting at a meeting for which there is a quorum.\n- - Special resolutions (for example amending the Articles of Association of Rio Tinto plc or the Constitution of Rio Tinto Limited), which require the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum.",

        "page_content": "The Sharing Agreement further classifies resolutions as Joint Decisions and class rights actions as explained on page 338.\n\nAnnual general meetings must be convened with 21 days' written notice for Rio Tinto plc and with 28 days' notice for Rio Tinto Limited. In accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the Rio Tinto plc AGM in 2021, other meetings of Rio Tinto plc may be convened with 14 days' written notice for the passing of a special resolution, and with 14 days' notice for any other resolution, depending on the nature of the business to be transacted. All meetings of Rio Tinto Limited require 28 days' notice. In calculating the period of notice, any time taken to deliver the notice and the day of the meeting itself are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business to be transacted.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nIf, at any time, the share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to each class may be varied, subject to the provisions of the relevant legislation, the written consent of holders of three-quarters in value of the shares of that class, or upon the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association and Constitution relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum for Rio Tinto plc should be two or more persons who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class.\n\n## Rights upon a winding-up\n\nExcept as the shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon a winding-up, the balance of assets available for distribution after the payment of all creditors (including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors), and subject to any special rights attaching to any class of shares, is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution should generally be made in cash. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of a special resolution of the shareholders, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the assets in specie or kind.\n\nThe Sharing Agreement describes the distribution of assets of each of the companies in the event of a liquidation, as explained on page 339.\n\n## Facility agreement\n\nDetails of the Group's $7.5 billion multi-currency committed revolving credit facilities are set out in 'Our capital and liquidity' section to the financial statements on page 190.\n\n## Exchange controls and foreign investment\n\n## Rio Tinto plc\n\nThere are no UK foreign exchange controls or other restrictions on the import or export of capital by, or on the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares, or that materially affect the conduct of Rio Tinto plc's operations. It should be noted, however, that various sanctions, laws, regulations or conventions may restrict the import or export of capital by, or the payment of dividends to, non-resident holders of Rio Tinto plc shares. There are no restrictions under Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association or under UK law that specifically limit the right of non-resident owners to hold or vote Rio Tinto plc shares. However, certain of the provisions of the Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the Takeovers Act) described below also apply to the acquisition by non-Australian persons of interests in securities of Rio Tinto plc.\n\n## Rio Tinto Limited\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, Australia does not impose general exchange or foreign currency controls. Subject to some specific requirements and restrictions, Australian and foreign currency may be freely brought into and sent out of Australia. There are requirements to report cash transfers in or out of Australia of A$10,000 or more. There is a prohibition on (or in some cases the specific prior approval of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or Minister for Foreign Affairs must be obtained for) certain payments or other dealings connected with countries or parties identified with terrorism, or to whom United Nations or autonomous Australian sanctions apply. Sanction, anti-money laundering and counterterrorism laws may restrict or prohibit payments, transactions and dealings or require reporting of certain transactions.\n\nRio Tinto Limited may be required to deduct withholding tax from foreign remittances of dividends, to the extent that they are unfranked, and from payments of interest.\n\nAcquisitions of interests in shares, and certain other equity instruments in Australian companies by non-Australian ('foreign') persons are subject to review and approval by the Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia under the Takeovers Act.\n\nIn broad terms, the Takeovers Act applies to acquisitions of interests in securities in an Australian entity by a foreign person where, as a result, a single foreign person (and any associate) would control 20% or more of the voting power or potential voting power in the entity. The potential voting power in an entity is determined having regard to the voting shares in the entity that would be issued if all rights (whether or not presently exercisable) in the entity were exercised.\n\nThe Takeovers Act also applies to direct investments by foreign government investors, in certain circumstances regardless of the size of the investment. Persons who are proposing relevant acquisitions or transactions may be required to provide notice to the Treasurer before proceeding with the acquisition or transaction.\n\nThe Treasurer has the power to order divestment in cases where relevant acquisitions or transactions have already occurred, including where prior notice to the Treasurer was not required. The Takeovers Act does not affect the rights of owners whose interests are held in compliance with the legislation.\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nExcept for the provisions of the Takeovers Act, there are no limitations imposed by law, Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association or Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, on the rights of non-residents or foreigners to hold the Group's ordinary shares or ADRs, or to vote that would not apply generally to all shareholders.\n\n## Directors\n\n## Appointment and removal of Directors\n\nThe appointment and replacement of Directors is governed by Rio Tinto plc's Articles of Association and Rio Tinto Limited's Constitution, relevant UK and Australian legislation, and the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board may appoint a Director either to fill a casual vacancy or as an addition to the Board, so long as the total number of Directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in these constitutional documents. An appointed Director must retire and seek election to office at the next AGM of each company. In addition to any powers of removal conferred by the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 , the company may by ordinary resolution remove any Director before the expiry of his or her period of office and may, subject to these constitutional documents, by ordinary resolution appoint another person who is willing to act as a Director in their place. In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors are required to stand for re-election at each AGM.",

These powers include the Directors' ability to issue or buy back shares. Shareholders' authority to empower the Directors to purchase its own ordinary shares is sought at the AGM each year. The constitutional documents can only be amended, or replaced, by a special resolution passed in general meeting by at least 75% of the votes cast.\n\n## UK listing rules cross-reference table\n\nThe following table contains only those sections of UK listing rule 9.8.4 C which are relevant.

        "page_content": "## Cautionary statement about forward-looking statements\n\nThis report includes 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 . All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report, including, without limitation, those regarding Rio Tinto's financial position, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations (including development plans and objectives relating to Rio Tinto's products, production forecasts, and reserve and resource positions), are forward-looking statements. The words 'intend', 'aim', 'project', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'plan', 'believes', 'expects', 'may', 'should', 'will', 'target', 'set to' or similar expressions, commonly identify such forward-looking statements.\n\nSuch forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Rio Tinto, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such forwardlooking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding Rio Tinto's present and future business strategies and the environment in which Rio Tinto will operate in the future. Among the important factors that could cause Rio Tinto's actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: an inability to live up to Rio Tinto's values and any resultant damage to its reputation; the impacts of geopolitics on trade and investment; the impacts of climate change and the transition to a low-carbon future; an inability to successfully execute and/ or realise value from acquisitions and divestments; the level of new ore resources, including the results of exploration programmes and/or acquisitions; disruption to strategic partnerships that play a material role in delivering growth, production, cash or market positioning; damage to Rio Tinto's relationships with communities and governments; an inability to attract and retain requisite skilled people; declines in commodity prices and adverse exchange rate movements; an inability to raise sufficient funds for capital investment; inadequate estimates of ore resources and reserves; delays or overruns of large and complex projects; changes in tax regulation; safety incidents or major hazard events; cyber breaches; physical impacts from climate change; the impacts of water scarcity; natural disasters; an inability to successfully manage the closure, reclamation and rehabilitation of sites; the impacts of civil unrest; the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; breaches of Rio Tinto's policies, standards and procedures, laws or regulations; trade tensions between the world's major economies; increasing societal and investor expectations, in particular with regard to environmental, social and governance considerations; the impacts of technological advancements; and such other risks identified in Rio Tinto's most recent annual report and accounts in Australia and the United Kingdom and the most recent annual report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC\n\nor Form 6-Ks furnished to, or filed with, the SEC. Forward-looking statements should, therefore, be construed in light of such risk factors and undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. These forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date of this report. Rio Tinto expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking (except as required by applicable law, the UK Listing Rules, the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Listing Rules of the Australian Securities Exchange) to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Rio Tinto's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based.\n\nNothing in this report should be interpreted to mean that future earnings per share of Rio Tinto plc or Rio Tinto Limited will necessarily match or exceed its historical published earnings per share.",
