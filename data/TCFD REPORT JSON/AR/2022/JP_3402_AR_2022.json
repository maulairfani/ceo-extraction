Accordingly, we have engaged in corporate activities with the ultimate goal of contributing to society. Toray's corporate philosophy, 'contributing to society through the creation of new value with innovative ideas, technologies, and products,' is based on the former company principle, 'Toyo Rayon contributes to communities,' which was first expressed and codified in 1955. It was revised to the present corporate philosophy in 1986. While far from a novel concept today, Toray understands that its e/fforts to carry out the philosophy of 'contributing to society' has attracted the recognition of society, which in turn has led to performance growth. At the same time, we have inherited the unwavering commitment to sustainability management of our predecessors, which entails developing human resources and taking all possible measures to protect the environment with an awareness toward chemistry-based manufacturing. Guided by this management vision, in 2018 we formulated the Toray Group Sustainability Vision. It clarifies the four perspectives of the world as envisioned by the Toray Group , and states internally and externally the commitment to initiatives that must be taken in order to realize them. Furthermore, in 2020, we announced details of the 'Toray Philosophy' as a systemized approach to the management vision that underpins the Company and has been passed down since our founding, including the corporate philosophy.\n\nI am deeply respectful of the fact that Toray Group executives and employees have contributed to the development of society in Japan and worldwide by introducing a variety of innovative materials based on this philosophy. I also keenly feel the weight of responsibility from being entrusted to lead the Company at a time of great change in the business environment.\n\nTogether with our more than 48,000 employees, we will continue to share Toray's mission since its founding to nurture people while contributing to society and the environment through our business activities, and this in turn will drive corporate development.\n\n## Raison d'\u00eatre of the Chemical Industry\n\nWe believe that sustainability is an extremely important issue for the chemical industry. The chemical industry has a critical mission to provide useful raw materials to help society become carbon neutral. On the other hand, the environmental impact of business activities is significant, so the cost burden of energy and",

        "page_content": "raw material conversion to achieve carbon neutrality is a major issue. In addition, there are areas where individual company e/fforts alone cannot address emissions reduction of the entire supply chain, such as promoting the use of renewable electricity and hydrogen, as well as the disposal of raw materials and after-use materials. We believe that the path to sustainable growth for chemical industry and materials manufacturers is to support the transformation of all industries and societies by creating innovations toward carbon neutrality, while utilizing frameworks for reducing GHG emissions throughout society, such as the Japanese government's Green Transformation (GX) measures and the GX League in Japan-a private sector-led initiative-to gain society's understanding for sharing some of the costs of transformation of social and industrial structures. Toray Group intends to take the initiative in the industry with respect to such e/fforts.\n\n## Toray Group Sustainability Initiatives\n\nThe basic concept of our carbon neutral initiatives is to promote both 'contribution to GHG reduction in society and reduction of emissions from our own business activities.' Under this concept, we aim to become carbon neutral in 2050 through the following four initiatives: (1) contribute to the carbon neutrality of society by expanding the Sustainability Innovation (SI) Business, (2) reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by thorough energy conservation, fuel conversion, and renewable electricity usage, (3) reduce Scope 3 emissions through recycling, biomass-derived raw materials usage, CO2 recovery and recycling, and (4) make gradual, continuous investments tailored to each country's energy situation.\n\nWith regard to the circular economy, we are promoting product recycling, utilizing biomass-derived raw materials, and conducting research on CO2 recovery and recycling. As there is growing momentum for recycling of end-of-life products, we will strive to build an advanced recycling system that only Toray Group can provide, such as reverse supply chain of polymer-related products, utilizing our strength of having multiple outlets for the same polymer including fiber, resin, film, composite materials, and water treatment. To this end, we will fully grasp the level of acceptance of environmental premiums by consumers, customer trends in each industry and product, and the status of regulations and rule formation. As for the use of biomass-derived raw materials, we are developing technologies that utilize non-edible and non-food biomass that does not compete with food. We have begun mass production of partial bio-polyethylene (PET) fiber utilizing bio-ethylene glycol (EG) derived from non-food sugarcane waste molasses, as well as commenced trial sales of nylon 510 fiber utilizing mainly non-edible castor beans.\n\nWe are also redoubling our e/fforts in projects that help reduce environmental burdens, such as seawater desalination using water treatment membranes and the reuse of wastewater, as well as projects that contribute to better medical care and foster public health .\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the past three years, the business environment has changed dramatically, with the spread of COVID-19 and the Ukraine situation leading to the greater prevalence of a bloc economy, as well as diversification in the way people work and their values. These are phenomena that we must respond to. In addition, capital e/fficiency to e/ffectively allocate and utilize limited management resources along with global risk management are becoming increasingly important. As a materials manufacturer that has operated under the premise of continuous capital investment, we have needed to demonstrate how we would seek solutions to increase earnings scale and e/fficiency.\n\nThe results are summarized in five basic strategies and financial strategies in AP-G 2025.\n\nBasic Strategy 1, 'Sustainable growth,' is based on the Toray Group Sustainability Vision. We will work to expand our business by allocating management resources to the Sustainability Innovation (SI) business and the Digital Innovation (DI) business as growth areas in which we can leverage our strengths and expect to increase earnings. DI supports the realization of a sustainable world.\n\nIn Basic Strategy 2, 'Ultimate value creation,' and Basic Strategy 3, 'Product and operational excellence,' we will leverage digital technology with a focus on the frontlines. For ultimate value creation, we will promote the integration of tangible and intangible assets, the extension of the value chain and cross-organizational value creation to add value to our businesses, while creating profitable new businesses that help solve social issues. For product and operational excellence, we will strengthen our quality capabilities and promote cross-organizational cost reduction activities that leverage the comprehensive strengths of our organization.\n\nIn Basic Strategy 4, 'Enhancement of people-centric management,' we will realize job satisfaction and supportive workplaces by securing and promoting diverse human resources, working to develop personnel, providing environment and opportunities that lead to employee pride in working for Toray Group, and building an organizational culture that values feedback from the frontlines.\n\nIn Basic Strategy 5, 'Risk management and governance,' we will appropriately control risks associated with business operations, such as economic security risks and country risks. We will also improve the e/ffectiveness of internal controls, eliminate opportunities for fraud, and ensure sound organizational operations.\n\nOur mission is to further deepen the understanding both internally and externally of the background and significance of the policies and strategies adopted and revised in AP-G 2025, as well as to implement the program.",

The SI and DI businesses to be expanded in Basic Strategy 1 include not only existing businesses but also businesses that require new investment and platforms, such as those related to resource recycling. In addition, investment is needed to accelerate GHG emission volume reductions. To this end, we will be even more balanced about allocating limited management resources mainly to capital investment, R&D, and human resources as we pursue business growth while maintaining a sound financial position. To help with this, we adopted ROIC as a new KPI. We will improve management resource e/fficiency and implement optimal reallocation, as well as increase capital e/fficiency by improving the balance between cash inflows and outflows and achieve sound, sustainable growth.\n\n## Expansion of the Sustainability Innovation (SI) and Digital Innovation (DI) Businesses\n\nWhile the international situation remains uncertain, there is further increase in demand to ensure a sustainable society.\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, we plan to invest a total of \u00a5450 billion in the SI and DI businesses, which we have designated as growth business fields, including capital investment and R&D expenses. We will also build a cross-organizational structure to propose comprehensive solutions to customers and accelerate external collaboration with the aim of expanding these businesses to account for almost 60% of consolidated revenue.\n\nAs a materials manufacturer with advanced research and technology development capabilities, Toray Group will continue to demonstrate the importance of its existence amid more opportunities to help achieve a sustainable society by expanding the SI and DI businesses.\n\nIn addition, Toray Group is developing materials for building a green hydrogen supply chain, as it foresees the arrival of an era when green hydrogen, made from power provided by renewable energy and water becomes the mainstream of energy medium for the world. Toray is already the global leader in key components such as hydrocarbon (HC)-based electrolyte membranes, which increase the performance of water electrolysis devices. Thus in June 2022, Toray established the HS Division directly under the authority of the President in order to expand this business for the membranes. In order to shift to full-scale global deployment for bolstering the introduction of green hydrogen, Toray has also begun cooperating with companies and organizations from Japan and overseas, including Siemens\n\n<!-- image -->",

That is something to be proud of, but revenue growth is essential as a means to continue this mission, as an ideal without means will not be realized.\n\nWhen I was at the frontlines of sales, I believed my role was to deliver to the market the products created by Toray's vaunted research, technology, and production, as well as to correctly communicate their value to the market and receive consideration for it. We will once again make known our basic approach to selling prices and our fundamental action of communicating with the market. We will also work on Toray's unique pricing strategy, which is data-driven and backed by digital technology.\n\nIn addition, we will create new value and increase our earning power by multiplying our tangible and intangible assets, including our accumulated elemental technologies and intellectual property, past capital expenditures, worldwide network of production bases, diverse business groups, and above all, the human resources who manage our business by making use of these assets.\n\n## People-centric management -Toray brand-\n\nPeople-centric management is one of the values and management view Toray Group has been passed down since its establishment as part of its corporate culture. We will continue to uphold this in order to put our corporate philosophy into practice. Toray's philosophy that 'success or failure of a company is decided by its people, and employees shape its destiny,' has been widely adopted not only in Japan but also overseas, and Toray is implementing Toray-style management on a global scale while respecting the di/fferences in customs and societal ways of thinking in each country and region.\n\nTo realize our corporate philosophy of 'contributing to society through the creation of new value with innovative ideas, technologies, and products,' we believe that the Toray brand is fostered when Toray Group employees deliver products and services of high technology and quality to customers and are recognized by society based on the Toray Philosophy. We consider the UL certification issue uncovered two years ago to be a matter that could have shaken the Toray brand. We will continue to work earnestly to prevent such a recurrence and restore confidence in our products.",

With dialogue as the starting point, Toray will focus on creating an environment where full-fledged corporate growth and human growth and happiness through team building and interpersonal skills leads to Toray's Group's sustainability.\n\n## Toward a truly sustainable company -Fundamentals lead to results-\n\nI am by no means trying to say anything new. Toray already has something to be proud of in terms of its management principles, technology, product creation ability, and people. Targeting the Corporate Philosophy and taking fundamental actions outlined in the Toray Philosophy, the united e/fforts of Toray executives and employees have made a di/fference and will lead to results. We will engage in dialogue with our customers and the market, earn the trust of society from the results of our corporate activities, and create a virtuous cycle in which employees work energetically with the aim of becoming a truly sustainable company. To this end, I am committed to taking a long-term, all-encompassing viewpoint to ensure that the direction in which each individual's actions will swell and move us forward is the correct one.

With this in mind, Toray Group is promoting active investment to promote 'global expansion in growth business fields.' To make this possible, the Group is working to maximize the value it can create over the medium-  to  long-  term  by  'strengthening  competitiveness' through continuous business model innovations and total cost reductions, and by 'strengthening the management foundation' to enable investment for growth based on enhanced capital investment e/fficiency and an improved financial structure.\n\nFurthermore, the Group had worked across all segments under the policy of 'global expansion in growth business fields' by expanding business activities through the supply of Green Innovation (GR) products and Life Innovation (LI) products, and since FY 2023, the Group has set a new target for the supply of Sustainability Innovation (SI) products that merge these two groups of products in an e/ffort to expand revenue and profit. In addition, the Group is actively engaged in the group-wide Future TORAY-2020s Project (FT Project). As part of this project, the Group is investing resources intensively in large-scale themes with the aim of achieving total revenue of around \u00a51 trillion in the 2020s across all new businesses.\n\n## Long-term Strategies to Achieve 'Sound, Sustainable Growth'\n\n## 1. Global Expansion in Growth Business Fields\n\n- \u00b7  Promote SI Business, which contributes to the solutions for issues of global environment, resource, and energy, as well as to better medical care, longevity, and the fostering of public health\n\n## 2. Strengthening Competitiveness\n\n- \u00b7  Create new value through business advancement and high-added-value creation, thereby providing solutions with material-oriented approaches to customers and society\n- \u00b7  Pursue dramatic cost reductions by setting challenging targets as well as strive to reduce environmental impact\n\n## 3.

At  the same time, it also established the four Group-wide initiatives of 'New business creation,' 'Advanced business management by utilizing digital technology,' 'Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in production activities,' and 'Ensuring the Toray Philosophy is fully embraced.' And to achieve 'Sound, sustainable growth' in line with the Long-Term Corporate Vision, TORAY VISION 2030, the Group took an approach that balanced the pursuit of business expansion through active investment with e/fforts to implement structure reforms and to reinforce the financial structure to facilitate the growth strategy.\n\nHowever, economic activity stagnated from the beginning of 2020 stemming from the spread of COVID-19, and growth subsequently slowed due to changes in the external environment, including the spread of infections to COVID variants, Russia's invasion to Ukraine, supply constraints from labor shortages and disruptions in logistics, and soaring resource prices from inflationary pressure. Although revenue managed to return to a recovery track from FY 2021 against the backdrop of progress in vaccinations, profits faced downward pressure due to shortcomings in passing on higher material prices to sales prices in line with increases in variable costs. A decline in factory\n\nutilization rates due to inventory adjustments in the semiconductor and display markets also had an impact. As a result, revenue and core operating income of FY 2022 both came in far below the initial targets, only reaching \u00a52,489.3 billion and \u00a596 billion, respectively.\n\n## Revenue and Core Operating Income\n\nVariance Analysis of Core Operating Income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Billion Yen                       | AP-G 2022 Target   | FY 2022 Actual   |   Di/fference | Factors for Increase and Decrease of Core Operating Income                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fibers & Textiles                 | 76.0               | 51.2             |         -24.8 | Income decreased due to pandemic-induced changes in the demand structure, such as a shift from formal wear to sports and out- door apparel.

Global Expansion in Growth Business Fields\n\nEven during the COVID-19 pandemic, our Green Innovation (GR) and Life Innovation (LI) businesses expanded and almost achieved their targets. Although revenue in the GR\n\nbusinesses was below target in carbon fiber for aircrafts and battery separator films, revenue expanded in resins for automobiles and motorcycles, large tow carbon fibers for wind turbine blade applications, water treatment membranes, and Toray Engineering's inspection and production equipment. As a result, the total amounted to \u00a5993.4 billion. In addition, revenue from the LI businesses came to",

However, the operating margins of both businesses declined due to the increased costs associated with rising raw material and fuel prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Strengthening Competitiveness\n\nAs a part of the Total Cost Reduction Project (NTC Project), we promoted cost competitiveness through constant variable cost and fixed cost reduction activities coupled with drastic cost reductions by means of production process innovation. We thereby achieved a reduction of \u00a5203.1 billion, significantly exceeding the three-year cumulative target of \u00a5150 billion.\n\n## Total Cost Reduction Project (Billion yen)\n\n|                                  |   FY 2020-2022 3-year total of reduction |   AP-G 2022 Target |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Variable cost reduction          |                                    119.3 |                100 |\n| Fixed cost reduction             |                                     67.6 |                 35 |\n| Innovation of production process |                                     16.2 |                 15 |\n| Total                            |                                    203.1 |                150 |\n\n## 3. Strengthening the Management Foundation\n\nOwing to careful selection of capital investment projects  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  free  cash  flow increased to \u00a5237.3 billion (three-year cumulative total), far surpassing the target of \u00a5120 billion. Furthermore, owing in part to an increase in retained earnings and greater equity due to foreign exchange impacts at group companies outside Japan, the D/E ratio was 0.62, which was far below the guideline of around 0.8. Meanwhile, the Group also focused its energies on structure reforms for low-growth and low-profitability businesses, including consolidating manufacturing bases in the Japanese fibers and textiles business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nIn addition to expanding the GR and LI Businesses, Toray Group also significantly exceeded its FY 2022 targets for GHG gas emissions and water usage per unit of revenue (20% and 25% reduction respectively compared with FY 2013). As a result of advancing activities targeting carbon neutrality through business activities, the Group significantly increased CO2 emissions avoided in the value chain by 9.5 times compared with FY 2013.\n\n## Sustainability Target for FY 2022\n\n|                                                                       | FY 2013 Actual  (Baseline year)  (J-GAAP)   | FY 2022 Actual  (Compared to FY  2013) (IFRS)   | FY 2022 Target  (Compared to FY  2013) (IFRS)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Avoided CO2 Emissions                                                 | 40 million tons                             | 9.5-fold                                        | 5.3-fold                                        |\n| Contributed Annual Water  Filtration Throughput                       | 27.23 million tons/day                      | 2.5-fold                                        | 2.4-fold                                        |\n| Greenhouse gas emissions  per unit of sales in  production activities | 337 tons/ 100 million yen                   | 233 tons/ 100 million yen  (35% reduction*)     | 20% reduction                                   |\n| Water consumption per  unit of sales in production  activities        | 15,200 tons/ 100 million yen                | 10,030 tons/ 100 million yen  (32% reduction*)  | 25% reduction                                   |\n\n- * The calculation of the figure for the baseline of FY 2013 includes data for companies that joined the Toray Group in FY 2014 or later.\n\n## Compliance\n\nDespite  deploying  activities  to  instill  the  compliance awareness of 'having the integrity to do the right thing in the right way,' inappropriate actions related to UL certification were discovered. Therefore, Toray Group set out to thoroughly investigate the root causes and implemented measures to prevent recurrence. In order to reform the corporate  culture  not  to  let  any  misconducts  happen again, the management team has expressed its commitment to compliance while the Group has engaged in activities to deepen communication with the frontlines.\n\n## Issues for the Next Medium-term Program\n\nIn looking to AP-G 2025, the Group recognized that the challenges that must be addressed were: (1) Expanding business  and  improving  profitability  (profit  margin),  (2) Accelerating sustainability measures, (3) Improving asset e/fficiency (concentrating  management  resources  on growth business fields), and (4) Enhancing internal controls and promoting even greater compliance awareness.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this respect, the Group will focus on value creation that enables the related growth strategy as well as strengthening the Group's human resources base that supports this  approach,  thereby  advancing  e/fforts  to  strengthen the management foundation in a way that enables growth investments from the perspectives of capital investment e/fficiency, the financial structure, and human resources.\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, the Group has set the basic strategies\n\nas 'sustainable growth,' 'ultimate value creation,' 'product and operational excellence,' 'enhancement of people-centric management,' and 'risk management and governance' to engage in e/fforts to expand the Sustainability Innovation (SI) Business and Digital Innovation (DI) Business as growth business fields, as well as in e/fforts involving business advancement and high-added-value creation. Other areas of focus include e/fforts to enhance quality strength and cost competitiveness. At the same time, the Group will ensure financial soundness by conducting business operations that consider a balance between profits, cash flow, and asset e/fficiency. Moreover, the Group will promote the expansion of high-growth and high-profitability businesses along with structure reforms for low-growth and low-profitability businesses in order to trace a new growth trajectory.\n\n## Basic Strategies of AP-G 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Seizing Profit  Opportunities             | Focusing management resources on Sustainability Innovation  Business and Digital Innovation Business                                                                                            |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Seizing Profit  Opportunities             | Maximizing profitability by making the most of tangible and  intangible assets, and by collaborating with external partners                                                                     |\n| Seizing Profit  Opportunities             | Promoting cross-organizational cost reduction activities lever- aging enhancement of quality strength and organizational  strength, which are the sources of competitiveness                    |\n| Strengthening  the Management  Foundation | Preserving and further building upon the legacy of our corpo- rate culture, which prioritizes developing people, while promoting  individual career development, and improving job satisfaction |\n| Strengthening  the Management  Foundation | Ensuring sound organizational management by enhancing  internal controls and improving management capabilities                                                                                  |\n|                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n## Financial Target for FY 2025\n\n|                       | FY 2022 Actual                              | FY  2025 Target                    |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Revenue               | 2,489.3 billion yen                         | 2,800.0 billion yen                |\n| Core Operating Income | 96.0 billion yen                            | 180.0 billion yen                  |\n| Core Operating Margin | 3.9%                                        | 6%                                 |\n| ROIC *1               | 2.7%                                        | About 5%                           |\n| ROE *2                | 5.0%                                        | About 8%                           |\n| Free Cash Flow        | 237.3 billion yen (3-year cumulative total) | Positive (3-year cumulative total) |\n| D/E Ratio             | 0.62                                        | 0.7 or lower (guideline)           |\n\n- Exchange rate assumption for AP-G 2025: 125 yen per US dollar\n- *1 ROIC = Core operating income after tax / Invested capital (average of the balances at beginning and end of the period)\n- *2 ROE = Net profit attributable to owners of parent / Average equity attributable to owners of parent",

As part of this strategy, the Group will work to expand businesses by concentrating  management  resources  on  growth  business fields. Similarly, the Group will contribute to the realization of a circular economy through e/fforts to reduce GHG emissions, recycle, and use biomass-based resources intended to 'achieve carbon neutrality for Toray Group.'\n\n## Expanding Business in Growth Business Fields Founded on the Toray Group Sustainability Vision\n\nGrowing demand for addressing sustainability and the evolution  of  digital  technology  indicate  increase  of  business opportunities in areas where Toray's core technologies can be utilized. One of such business fields in which greater profits are expected by exercising Toray's strengths is the Sustainability Innovation (SI) Business. It is a redefinition of a combination of Green Innovation (GR) Business and Life Innovation (LI) Business the Group had focused on thus far in line with the Toray Group Sustainability Vision. Another is the Digital Innovation (DI) Business, which will serve to help realize the four perspectives of the world envisioned for 2050. We have newly positioned both as growth business fields that supports the 'sound, sustainable growth' of the Group.\n\nThe Group will allocate \u00a5450 billion worth of resources consisting of capital investments and R&D expenditures to the SI and DI Businesses. With this resources, the Group intends to build a cross-organizational structure and accelerate both comprehensive solution proposals to customers, as well as internal collaborations, with an aim of expanding these businesses to account for approximately 60% of consolidated revenue. Furthermore, these allocations will solidify the Group's position as a 'leading company in the materials business that contribute to sustainability,' and will embody its core value of 'contributing to society through business activities.'\n\n## Toray Group Growth Business Fields\n\n## Growth Business Fields under AP-G 2022\n\n## Growth Business Fields under AP-G 2025\n\n## Revenue from Growth Business Fields\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00b7  Expansion of the Sustainability Innovation (SI) Business\n\nThe SI Business aims to achieve \u00a51,600 billion revenue by FY 2025 through the focused allocation of capital investments, R&D, and other resources.

In particular, the Group plans to invest \u00a5450 billion in growth business fields, with \u00a5270 billion in capital investments and \u00a5180 billion in R&D expenditures. In addition\n\nto large-scale investments intended to expand business, the Group will also execute capital investments to address sustainability,  improve  quality  strength,  enhance  cost competitiveness  (including  digital  technology  use),  and upgrade aging facilities. The Group will conduct strategic investments in M&As and alliances separately from its capital investments. Meanwhile, the Group seeks to improve ROIC through profitability and capital e/fficiency enhancements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor M&A, conduct strategic investments separately from capital investments\n\n## Maintaining Financial Soundness and Capital Allocation\n\nAlthough free cash flow (three-year cumulative total) and the D/E ratio improved significantly compared with the initial plan under AP-G 2022, improvements in asset e/fficiency have lagged. Therefore, along with concentrating management resources in growth business fields and engaging in strategic pricing, the Group will raise the reliability of returns, which will connect to improved ROIC. Specifically, for this purpose the Group will further strengthen e/fforts to identify risks involved in, as well as to enhance management of, capital investments and R&D expenditures.\n\nAlong with assuming an operating cash inflow of \u00a5760 billion over the three-year period from FY 2023 to FY 2025, capital investments and R&D expenditures are envisioned to generate an investment cash outflow of \u00a5720 billion. This capital allocation aims to achieve a positive free cash flow, thereby stabilizing and increasing shareholder returns. Furthermore, the Group will revise the D/E ratio guideline downward from around 0.8 to 0.7 or lower to support sound, sustainable growth based on a strong financial foundation.\n\n## AP-G 2025 targets | \u00b7 Free cash flow : Positive (3-year total)   \u00b7 D/E ratio : 0.7 or lower\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

E/fficient Use of Working Capital\n\nIn order to address today's drastically changing business environment,  the  Group  must  minimize  inventories  for products, as well as inventories in the intermediate process and upstream raw material procurement stages. For this purpose, the Group will leverage DX to visualize and optimize inventory along the supply chain, as well as continue 3C-i activities for working capital. At the same time, it will seek to reduce working capital by managing the number of days for inventory and receivables and payables.\n\n## Working Capital and CCC (Cash Conversion Cycle)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCCC (right axis)\n\n## 2. Business Portfolio Reforms\n\nUnder AP-G 2022, the Group analyzed the business portfolio along the two axes of growth potential and ROIC, and mainly promoted structure reforms for businesses belonging to the low-growth and low-profitability category. Under AP-G 2025, the Group will employ revenue growth rates as an indicator for growth potential and ROIC as an indicator for profitability. These axes will serve as standards for categorizing Toray Group businesses and companies into 'high-growth and high-profitability businesses,' 'lowgrowth  and  high-profitability  businesses,'  'high-growth\n\nand  low-profitability  businesses,'  and  'low-growth  and low-profitability businesses.'

Many of the growth drivers for AP-G 2025 are categorized in this area.\n- \u00b7  The Group aims to shift 'low-growth and low-profitability businesses' into the other three categories through structure reforms. In the case where businesses have low  potential  for  escaping  from  the  low-growth  and low-profitability category and where such businesses continue to generate losses, the Group will consider withdrawal and reduction.\n\n## Four categories for growth potential and profitability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholder Return Policy\n\nToray Group considers the appropriate distribution of profits to shareholders to be an important management issue, and therefore aims to increase dividends through earnings growth. This approach is taken under the Group's basic policy  of  maintaining  stable  and  continuous  dividends\n\nwhile comprehensively taking into account business earnings trends, the financial structure, and the securing of retained earnings necessary for future growth. The dividend payout ratio is set to 30% or more.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we have been expanding our Green Innovation (GR) businesses since 2011 and our Life Innovation (LI) businesses since 2014. In 2018, we released the Toray Group Sustainability Vision, which outlines the world we aspire to live in, the challenges we face, and our e/fforts to resolve them.\n\nToray's mission is to provide the necessary solutions to the challenges facing the world in terms of balancing development and sustainability through supplying innovative technologies and advanced materials. In addition, we have defined promotion of growth strategies based on the Toray Group Sustainability Vision as our basic long-term strategy, with the aim of achieving 'sound, sustainable growth.'\n\nOur  growth  strategy  involves  targeting  business expansion through aggressive capital investment made during the past four medium-term management programs, investing management resources in such growth business fields as carbon fiber composite materials. As a materials manufacturer that provides materials to all industries, Toray needs to identify growth business fields and invest capital in advance to fulfill its social responsibility to ensure high quality and stable supply globally. On the other hand, sustainable growth requires continuous capital investment and development to realize such\n\na sustainable society, including capital investment and promotion of DX.\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, we will maximize the cash generated from tangible and intangible assets accumulated to date, under the theme of 'value creation' that enables this. To this end, our priority is to improve overall profitability and asset e/fficiency by increasing the share of Sustainability  Innovation  and  Digital  Innovation  businesses, which are highly profitable growth business fields. The subheading of AP-G 2025, 'Value Creation for New Momentum,' also implies that Toray Group will reach even greater heights through a renewed focus on the creation of social and customer value. There is accelerating movement worldwide toward sustainability, led by decarbonization. For Toray as a materials manufacturer which has accumulated advanced research and technology development capabilities, this means ever increasing opportunities to help solve social issues. We are certain that we can play an even more important role in realizing this.\n\n37\n\n<!-- image -->",

In view of these aspirations, I would like to shine a light on our measures for 'ultimate value creation.'\n\n## Group-Wide Action to Support Growth Business Fields\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, we will not only focus on the growth of each business, but also look to expand in growth business fields through Group-wide action. Toray applies a single polymer to diverse fields such as fibers and textiles, films, and resins and has the ability to use this polymer in a wide variety of processes from polymerization to processed products globally. This strength in turn allows us to recover recycled resources and expand into a wide range of businesses. In June 2022, we established the Environmental Solutions Department, a dedicated department to formulate resource recycling strategies across our businesses by identifying markets in which we can promote the value of resource-recycling materials. Positioning the resource recycling market as a growth field, we will work to promote both sustainability and economic growth.\n\nIn the Mobility field, we established the Next Mobility Department to provide direct marketing to OEMs and to  deliver  speedy  solutions  to  customers,  leveraging cross-organizational,  products,  and  regional  collaboration. In this manner, we will increase the value o/ffered to customers as a set rather than a single item. We have, for example, combined Ultrasuede\u2122 and TORAYPEF\u2122 as surface and base materials, respectively, in order to provide new value. We anticipate this initiative will help trigger the application of these composite materials in the specifications of other proposals.\n\n## Enriching and Extending the Global Value Chain\n\nToray Group's trading company revenue (excluding intercompany  sales)  totals  \u00a51,050  billion,  which  exceeds that of its competitors. Moreover, we have developed structures in our respective businesses that not only\n\npromote local production for local consumption, but are also resistant to geopolitical risks and capable of steadfastly fulfilling our supply responsibilities. These factors make up Toray's intangible assets that the Company has continued to build up since its overseas expansion in the 1950s. Looking ahead, we will strategically place human resources in areas close to end customers and fine tune our global sales operation capabilities.\n\nIn  addition,  we  will  maximize  the  value  provided to customers while enriching and extending the value chain by leveraging collaboration with overseas business sites and external resources, creating high-added-value through  advanced  processing  and  technology  integration,  addressing  sustainability  issues,  and  promoting other measures. As part of the Group's endeavors, we launched the AI-based material concierge service as a DX service to help customers optimally select materials and reduce development time in the resin business in 2023. In the water treatment business, we will also focus on subscription-based  services  that  help  customers  minimize their management burden while ensuring stable facility operations through TORAYWISE\u2122, our proprietary real-time monitoring system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employing Strategic Pricing\n\nWe believe it is extremely important to have a pricing strategy that appropriately reflects the value created to improve profitability. Taking into consideration the environment and market conditions of each business, we will therefore take advantage of every opportunity to proactively improve pricing. For example, we are utilizing digital tools to plot customer transactions on the two axes of sales volume and price. In visualizing customers whose sales volume and prices do not match specifications, we have already initiated steps to negotiate price increases.\n\n## Enhancing Brand Value\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, the Group as a whole will leverage its profile as a driving force throughout the organization to win not just on product specifications and price, but",

For example, Ultrasuede\u2122, an ultra-microfiber nonwoven material with a suede texture, clearly defines our business vision and commitment to customers. As a result of our continued e/fforts to promote the cool image of Made in Japan as our brand identity, in conjunction with the Toray corporate brand, we have witnessed an increase in the brand value of Ultrasuede\u2122 by a factor of 5.2 times from \u00a56.6 billion in FY 2017 to \u00a534.2 billion in FY 2022. At the same time, we are working toward the 100% use of plant-based raw materials to further enhance our brand value. In line with these endeavors, we will also proactively enhance our brand value in our performance chemicals, carbon fiber, water treatment, and other businesses under AP-G 2025.\n\n## Improving Asset E/fficiency\n\n## First, Improve ROIC to Approximately 5%\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, we have set certain financial targets for FY 2025 as KPIs. This includes core operating income of \u00a5180 billion (\u00a596 billion in FY 2022) and ROIC of approximately 5% (2.7% in FY 2022). As far as our core operating income is concerned, we will work to improve our capacity utilization rate by expanding quantities sold in growth business fields. In addition, we will improve our profitability by ultimate value creation, including improvement in pricing. As a part of these endeavors, we will take steps to increase ROIC by reducing working capital and continuing to engage in reengineering with a focus on lowgrowth and low profitability businesses while improving the turnover of existing assets.\n\nOver  the  period  of  AP-G  2025,  the  Performance Chemicals Business which experienced a decline in FY 2022, is projected to enjoy the largest increase in income owing to recovery in market conditions.

This undivided R&D organization  is  able  to  generate  new  technologies through  fusion  and  integration  of  existing  technologies more easily and enables more rapid deployment of advanced materials to a wide range of business fields. Each division at the Toray Technology Center is engaged in R&D involving various materials based on the four core technologies of organic synthetic chemistry, polymer chemistry, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. In many cases, the new materials conceived in this center flourish in other business fields. Another major characteristic is that the Group can fully utilizes its combined strengths by exploiting the technologies and knowledge from many di/fferent fields to solve problems in an individual business field.\n\nToray  Group  has  been  particularly  focused  in recent years on enhancing the use of these combined strengths. In this respect, it has been fusing its core technologies with its 'chemical engineering process,' 'engineering,'and 'analysis technologies' in an e/ffort to accelerate development for key initiatives. In the area of 'chemical engineering process,' the Group creates safe, cost-competitive  processes  from  the  perspective  of chemical engineering, and supports group-wide themes. In the area of engineering, the Group applies molding, surface treatment, AI, and other elemental technologies to realize and demonstrate innovative processes and equipment that are able to consistently produce products with the nanometer scale, thereby contributing to the development of equipment capable of consistently producing nano-level products, as one example. In the area of analysis, the Group leverages high-end electron microscopes and other devices that can directly observe molecules  to  analyze  structures  and  compositions.\n\nTechnology  Center  centralizes  these  technologies  to solve various challenges involved in research, technological development, and manufacturing.\n\n## Acceleration of Cross-Business Deployment of Separation Membrane Technology\n\nSince the 1980s, Toray Group has created unique separation membrane technologies such as dialyzer and reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. Going forward, further evolution and development of these technologies will move in an increasingly interesting direction. For example, in the area of water treatment, these membranes are used to collect valuable materials and to separate oil from water, and in the health care field, their uses are expanding in areas such as personal protective clothing and new blood purifiers. Moreover, in the chemicals area, research is progressing in biochemical processes that integrate separation technologies and biotechnologies. Similarly, in the area of new energy, membrane technologies are being rolled out for use in electrolyte membranes designed to produce hydrogen for the realization of a hydrogen society. Serving as a means of creating added-value in such a broad range of industrial fields, separation membrane technology is rooted in the fiber, textile, and film technologies possessed by Toray Group. Without question, this cross-business technology deployment stems from the Group's undivided R&D organization.\n\n## Using Super Nanotechnology in the Creation of High-Added-Value Products\n\nEach of Toray Group's business fields possesses many unique and high-value di/fferentiated products, or so-called unrivaled technologies and products, which stand on its advanced technological capabilities. Along with making these technologies the de facto standard and expanding market share, the Group continues to engage in\n\n## Undivided R&D Organization\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCenter, Inc.",

NANODESIGN\u2122, NANOALLOY\u2122, and nano-multilayer are just three of these technologies that have enabled a leap in the improvement of material properties and that have created products with characteristics unique to Toray Group. Likewise, the Group is focusing its energy into these technologies, which it refers to in general as Super Nanotechnology.\n\nNANODESIGN\u2122 is a proprietary flow control technology that forms fiber cross-sections at the level of points and that controls the process at the nano-scale, thereby creating unprecedented fibers. This technology has enabled the fibers to have luster, moisture retention, water repellency, elasticity, and other properties as we like. Meanwhile, NANOALLOY\u2122 is a technology that disperses and kneads di/fferent polymers at the nanolevel as a means of expressing heat resistance, resilience, and various other properties to a higher degree. This technology has been adopted for impact-absorbing components for sports equipment and automobiles. Finally, nano-multilayer technology allow us to individually design film thicknesses ranging from several hundred  to  a  thousand  layers,  thereby  enabling  flexible wavelength selection design. This technology is used in a wide array of applications, including films with metallic luster and films for automobile head-up displays.\n\nBy deploying these Super Nanotechnologies within each business field, the Group aims to expand related revenue to the level of \u00a540 billion by FY 2025 (from approx. \u00a512 billion in FY 2022).\n\n## Super Nanotech\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing \u00a5220 Billion in R&D Expenditures under AP-G 2025\n\nToray  has  consistently  increased  its  R&D  expenditures under the concept that research and technological development provide the key to building the Toray of tomorrow. During the three-year period of AP-G 2025,\n\nthe Group envisions R&D expenditures reaching the level of \u00a5220 billion, a \u00a525 billion increase from AP-G 2022 period. The Group will accelerate development through allocating more of these R&D expenditures to the high-added-value themes prioritized by each business field in the aim of increasing revenue in FY 2025 by more than \u00a5200 billion over FY 2022.\n\n## Priority Subjects for the Technology Center\n\n## High-added-value themes prioritized by each business field\n\n| Fields                                  | Priority issues for the Technology Center                                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fibers & Textiles                       | NANODESIGN\u2122, recycled fibers                                               |\n| Resins & Chemicals                      | PPS resin, NANOALLOY\u2122 resin , fine particles                               |\n| Films                                   | Nano-multilayer film,  lithium-ion battery separator film                  |\n| Carbon Fiber Composite  Materials       | Intermediate materials for industrial use,  fuel cell electrode substrates |\n| Electronic & Information  Materials     | Electronic coating materials,  environmentally friendly printing materials |\n| Pharmaceuticals &  Medical Products     | APOA2-i, acute lung injury treatment column                                |\n| Water Treatment,  Environment & Amenity | RO membranes for seawater desalination,  air filters                       |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ecodear\u2122 is a plant-based synthetic fiber which does not a/ffect atmospheric CO2 concentration even when incinerated. Toray Group markets Ecodear\u2122 N510, a 100% plant-based nylon fiber produced from nylon raw materials such as castor oil plants and corn. Premarketing examples of 100% plant-based polyester include Patagonia's Sugar Down and headrest covers of All Nippon Airways' ANA Green Jet, a special aircraft to embody its environment slogan 'ANA Future Promise.'\n\n&+\u2122 is a recycled fiber made from collected PET bottles, fishing nets, and other waste materials that can be made into high-added-value functional fibers with traceability functions. Fishing nets and gear are said to account for 10% of marine plastic waste by weight. The viability of the recycling business depends on involvement of stakeholders. When people's thoughts and actions for the future are connected (&), new value (plus factors) is added. For example, we are making fibers from the PET bottles collected from the 2023 Tokyo Marathon and recycling it into the uniforms to be worn by volunteers from the following year. In addition, boxes have been set up next to vending\n\nmachines located in the Group's business  and  production  bases in Japan to collect PET bottles for use in the manufacture of &+\u2122. Promotional activities have begun in Malaysia with the cooperation of the Penang state government to extend this initiative overseas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Product and Operational Excellence\n\nIn the pursuit of product and operational excellence, we are strengthening our textile sales capabilities to leading apparel customers in Japan and overseas with a focus on our high-performance materials AIRTASTIC\u2122, Primeflex\u2122,  and  Dermizax\u2122.  Moreover,  we  will  continue our e/fforts to deepen and extend our global supply chain for apparel applications, with a particular emphasis\n\n## Enhancing Global Megabrand Expansion\n\nAdvanced nylon and polyester fabric made of Toray's unique thin yarns, light and compact, with soft textures\n\nAdvanced fabric with flexible and stretching texture.

We also brought to the market TORAYCA\u2122 resin, a carbon fiber reinforced plastic. In addition to an extensive array of products, we provide total solutions encompassing a wide range of areas, including material development\n\nand proposals, design proposals, and support for process and molding, to comprehensively assist customers in their product development activities. These e/fforts are backed by the strength of our global capabilities and network of 19 business and production bases in 10 countries outside Japan. Toray Group is also successively increasing its compound production capacity in growth regions.\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, we will work to enhance the performance of our resin compound business as a first step in creating high-added-value. The percentage of high-performance product revenue to total revenue in the engineering plastic resins business will climb from 30% in 2022 to 36% in 2025. In specific terms, we are targeting 250% growth in revenue from xEV-related sales, where demand is projected to especially expand in FY 2025 compared with FY 2022. If we meet the target, the ratio of xEV applications within the automobile applications is expected to reach 46%.\n\n## Automobile applications (Trend in revenue)\n\nExpansion of engineering plastics business for automobile applications: 135% (Revenue from FY 2022    FY 2025)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPPS resins form a second integral component of e/fforts  for  high-added-value  creation.  PPS  resin  is  a super  engineering  plastic  with  long-term  heat  resistance, chemical resistance, and flame-retardant properties.  Its  use  is  expanding  in  versatile  applications, including power semiconductors. Toray has established the  world's  only  integrated  monomer/polymer/compound  production  system  and  held  a  32%  share  of global PPS compound sales in 2022. During the AP-G 2025 period, we will expand our polymerization facilities in South Korea as well as sales globally, focusing on Europe and China with the goal of securing a global market share of 36% by 2025.\n\nThird in our e/fforts for high-added-value creation, we will look to our ABS resins. While competition for general purpose ABS resins is becoming increasingly harsh, we expect demand for high-performance ABS resins to return to a 5% annual growth trajectory, and will focus on transparent ABS resins and automobile applications. We aim to maintain our number one share of the global market for transparent ABS resin, and are targeting a global share of 45% by FY 2025, with sales volumes",

Furthermore, we aim to establish our status as a high performance and sustainable ABS resin supplier by developing the market for recycled grades and launching ABS resins using bio-based monomers. In addition, to strengthen our ability to create value through digital innovation, we will integrate materials informatics (MI) and design support tools (CAE systems).\n\nWe aim to increase the value we provide to customers by significantly shortening product development lead times, significantly reducing product development costs, and achieving the selection of the best material candidate.\n\n## Chemicals Business\n\n## Expanding the Fine Chemicals Business\n\nIn the chemicals business, we aim to expand sales mainly of products with the world's top market share by utilizing our proprietary technologies and raw materials. In specific terms, we will focus on New Zeolite (NZ) products that contribute to the advancement of agricultural and food security as raw materials for agricultural chemicals, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is used as a cleaning agent and solvent for semiconductors and electronic components, and Thiokol\u2122, which contributes to high insulation and energy conservation as a sealant for insulating glass. DMSO, in particular, is safe and is expected to be in demand as a substitute for other catalysts.\n\nToray  has  also  developed  the  world's  first  interferon drug for cats and dogs and a chronic kidney disease drug for cats with the aim of extending the healthy life expectancy of companion animals. In the aromatic fine chemicals business, we will focus on proposing fragrances to the cosmetics industry based on market research and analysis, and building a flavor supply network to China, ASEAN, and other countries for the food industry. Moreover, as a new business, we will promote the development of high-performance resin powders for 3D printing by utilizing our high-performance polymer design technology.\n\n## Strengthening the Lactam and Lactam-Related Business\n\nToray's caprolactam uses the Company's unique photoreaction technology to realize high safety and easy process. To further reduce environmental impact, we are also developing a new type of lamp that uses LED as its photoreactive light source. Moreover, we are expanding our business in various fields by leveraging the by-products generated during caprolactam production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Contributing to the Realization of a Sustainable Society\n\nWhile focusing on expanding sales of high-performance products, we are working to make materials more sustainable through three methods: (1) material recycling, in which plastic products are collected from the market and returned to the polymer or compounding process; (2) chemical recycling, in which collected raw materials are depolymerized and returned to the monomer process; and (3) bio-based production of raw materials. While our e/fforts are currently focused on material recycling, we aim to push forward with chemical recycling and the use of bio-based raw materials during the period. Through these means, we aim to employ sustainable materials for 30% of the raw materials we sell by 2030.\n\nTaking  all  of  the  aforementioned  into  consideration, Toray aims to capture demand in the xEV and other growth  markets  by  enhancing  its  solution  proposing capabilities, expanding global bases, and developing high-performance products in the resins business. Furthermore, by expanding the fine chemicals business, we aim to increase core operating income in the resins and chemicals businesses as a whole by \u00a516 billion in FY 2025 compared with FY 2022.\n\nT\n\nora\n\n<!-- image -->",

Drawing on this network, Toray Group is developing such products as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films that pursue ultimate performance and biaxially oriented polypropylene (OPP) films for a variety of applications, including smartphones,  displays,  and  electronic  components  used in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), capacitors, motors, and batteries for automobiles as well as food packaging materials through polymer, nano, film making and other fundamental technologies.\n\n## Main Initiatives of AP-G 2025\n\n## Expanding the Digital Innovation and Mobility Businesses\n\nThe thinner the functional film, the better is its product characteristics. As a result, the growth in functional film demand is seen mainly in capacitor dielectric material, semiconductor manufacturing processing, and mobility-related applications.\n\nAs far as capacitor dielectric applications are concerned, MLCCs are becoming smaller while increasing in capacity at an accelerating pace. This reflects the improved performance of electronic devices and higher data transmission volume. Under these circumstances, Toray's PET films have been adopted by many MLCC manufacturers owing to their superior smoothness and cleanliness, which enables thinner and more ceramic layers. Based on the increase in demand, we will increase production capacity in Japan by 1.6 times compared with the current level by 2025. For our ultrathin OPP capacitor films for xEVs, for which we hold a 60% global market share, steps have already been taken to increase production capacity in Japan by 1.6 times in 2022. As the leader in the automotive capacitor film market thanks to our ultra-thin, high voltage resistance, high-quality products, we plan to increase our production capacity another 1.4 times by 2025 in light of the forecast growing demand for xEVs.\n\nIn the area of semiconductor packaging manufacturing process applications, we will strengthen our production system for dry film photoresist (DFR) application PET films, which are essential for the formation of semiconductor circuit boards amid the trend toward finer wiring. Toray boasts a high market share in the high-end\n\nDFR market and is taking preparatory steps to address increased  demand  in  areas  where  sound  growth  is expected, including data center servers.\n\nFrom a mobility application perspective, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) films with high heat resistance and durability (resistance to hot water, strong acids, and chemicals)  are  enjoying  widespread  acceptance  and use as xEV motor insulation materials and in fuel cell vehicle (FCV) as well as hydrogen production equipment applications. Sales are expanding rapidly in China, especially for motor applications. Complementing this product, we are strengthening global partnerships to create new applications for our PICASUS\u2122 brand of polyester films which employs our nano-layering technology. PICASUS\u2122 helps to control light direction by enabling the transmission of vertical incident light while reflecting obliquely incident light and addresses the needs of xEVs for heat insulation and automated driving.\n\n## Demand Forecast : PET Film for MLCC Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expanding the Sustainability Innovation Business\n\nToray has taken the lead ahead of its competitors to collect and recycle the PET film discarded after use in the MLCC manufacturing and other processes. Moving forward, we will deepen collaboration with supply chain companies  to  provide  this  recycling  system  more broadly. Moreover, we will promote the early introduction of chemical recycling and development of bio-based PET.\n\nResponding  to  pressing  social  issues  including reducing food loss (extend the shelf life of food) and use of plastic, we are developing films for use in packaging materials that combine high-barrier PET films with",

These films have a structure that does not use aluminum foil as a barrier material to preserve quality and enables microwave heating, which emits 80% less CO2 when compared with boiling. We project our products will become mainstream in the retort market going forward. Furthermore, we are promoting the shift to mono-material packaging to address the recycling di/fficulties encountered with packaging materials made of di/fferent ones.\n\n## Reducing Food Waste and Plastic Consumption\n\n- -Films for Retort Pouches\n\n## Existing structure\n\n## Sustainable structure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4-Layer Total 104mic\n\n## Strengthening Ultimate Value Creation and Competitiveness\n\nToray Group will focus on strategic pricing and promoting value in its bid to create ultimate value. The market for the general-purpose films used in electronic components is distinguished by its large number of customers and decentralized pricing strategies. In reality, prices have repeatedly risen and fallen from the initial prices set individually due to a variety of circumstances, including the balance between supply and demand as well as fluctuations in raw material and fuel prices. In this instance, we classify customers into major and long tail users, quantify the risk of losing business, extract customers and products where prices are not appropriate in terms of price, sales volume, and specifications, and take steps to negotiate price hikes. Meanwhile, in the case of PET film for dry film resist (DFR) use, for example, we will focus on reflecting our e/fforts to reduce circuit defects attributable to foreign substances inside films and surface micro-scratches, to help reduce customers' production costs, and other initiatives in our product prices.\n\nTo strengthen our competitiveness, we will create new products and markets by leveraging our strengths\n\nin multi layer, coating, and polymer design technologies, while upgrading and expanding our production and processing sites in line with the growing demand for films. We will also strengthen our cost competitiveness by introducing innovative processes and promoting smart factories using DX technology.\n\nTaking into account the aforementioned, we will focus on expanding the digital innovation, mobility, and sustainable  innovation  businesses  while  promoting  initiatives to strengthen our ultimate value creation and competitiveness. Through these means, we will work to increase core operating income by \u00a528.0 billion in FY 2025 compared with FY 2022.\n\n## Target for FY 2025 (Performance Chemicals)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Next, we build high barriers to entry with an intellectual property  (IP)  network,  production  performance  (high quality, stable supply, cost competitiveness), and customer support to become the 'Only One.' We will also promote de facto standardization and establish our position as 'Number One.' We call this 'The One' Strategy and under AP-G 2025 will bring about the spiraling up of this cycle.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  recession  due  to  stay-at-home demand, in the previous Medium-Term Management Program, Project AP-G 2022, the results for the final fiscal year were a/ffected by inventory adjustments in the display and semiconductor supply chains. Despite the decline, however, we had been steadily laying the groundwork for AP-G 2025 during the same period.\n\nFirst,  in  the  semiconductor  and  JISSO  (packaging) market, we took advantage of the spread of xEVs and renewable energy infrastructure and, in addition to concentrating our e/fforts on the development of materials for power semiconductors with a high market share, greatly expanded our share in the Chinese market. Having developed a photodefinable polyimide material that is free of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent and thereby contributes to reducing environmental impact, we are also advancing toward making this the de facto standard coating material for semiconductors. In the display field, we made progress in developing materials for micro LEDs while maintaining good relationships with OLED display manufacturers. In the printing-related field, we have developed a volatile organic compound (VOC)-free printing technology and are focusing on developing label and package printing applications. In new fields, we worked on the development of multi-core optical fibers, for which NANODESIGN\u2122 technology was adopted, and development of high-resolution scintillator panels.\n\nWe have also strengthened our support system by assigning key personnel in sales, research, and technology to major locations around the world. Under AP-G  2025,  we  will  promote  'The  One'  Strategy underpinned by these foundations.\n\n## Main Initiatives of AP-G 2025\n\n## Semiconductor & JISSO Market: Sales Expansion of Materials for Power Semiconductors\n\nThe  semiconductor  market  has  experienced  repeated cycles of growth and stagnation and it is expected to expand at an average annual growth rate of 7% or more until 2025. Under such circumstances, by means of our close relationships with leading companies and industry-academia-government collaboration, we aim to expand our business to exceed the market growth rate through, for example, the development of high-performance products in advance of the market, the establishment of bases in growth regions, sales expansion of environmentally friendly products (the NMP-free polyimide coating material). Geared toward xEVs and renewable energy in particular, with regard to power semiconductor applications, which are expected to further expand, we will focus on meeting the needs for highly reliable bu/ffer coatings and thermal conductive materials with high heat resistance and high voltage resistance.\n\n## Display Market: Expansion of Business Centered on OLED\n\nIn the display market, OLED, which features high brightness, e/fficient dimensional designs, and low power dissipation, is beginning to be used not only in mid-sized TVs and smartphones but also in tablets and for automotive displays. Used as a material for insulation layers and  planarization  layers,  Toray's  photodefinable  polyimide is becoming the de facto standard in the OLED\n\n## Market Size of OLED Displays\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the micro LED market for next-generation displays, we also provide many related materials for wearable devices and VR goggles while preparing for full-scale market growth.\n\n## Printing Market: Accelerating Development of Applications for Completely VOC-Free Printing Systems\n\nIn the printing industry, the use of large amounts of organic  solvents  for  inks  and  cleaning  agents  has become an issue in terms of environmental friendliness and work environment. In response, Toray has succeeded in developing a completely VOC-free printing system that does not use organic solvents using IMPRIMA\u2122,  an  o/ffset  printing  plate  that  does  not require dampening water, and water-soluble electron beam (EB) curable ink. With this innovative system that can significantly reduce CO2 emissions, we will work with partner companies to accelerate the development of applications such as food packaging.\n\n## Achieved 'Completely ZERO VOC Printing System'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Estimated by Toray with solvent gravure printing emissions as 100\n\n## New Growth Markets: Focus on Multi-Core Optical Fibers and X-Ray Scintillator Panels\n\nIn new areas, we have developed a multi-core optical fiber that pushes the boundaries of conventional optical fibers by combining our proprietary NANODESIGN\u2122 technology and resin flow control technology. By arranging multiple cores that transmit light in a single fiber, this product simultaneously achieves high-speed, high-capacity communication as well as power savings and is thus expected to be found applications in data centers and supercomputers.\n\nWe have also developed a scintillator panel for digital X-ray inspection with the world's highest resolution. X-ray  digital  imaging  promises  high-speed  processing and low cost, but the problem is that the image becomes blurry due to the di/ffusion of light within the panel. In response to this, we are developing cellular\n\nscintillator technology that can obtain clear X-ray digital images by forming fine partition walls for each pixel. We aim to find applications in, for example, nuclear power plant piping inspections, aircraft part inspections, and the medical field, including mammography.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the electronic information and materials business, we aim to increase our core operating income by \u00a514 billion in fiscal 2025 (compared with fiscal 2022) by expanding the market share of our materials for OLED displays and power semiconductors as well as by promoting diversification through the launch of new businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In particular, energies will be directed toward the three main tasks of (1) capturing recovery in aircraft demand, (2) reforming its business\n\nstructure based on the industrial application expansion, and (3) strengthening quality and cost competitiveness.\n\n## Items to be accomplished in the three years of AP-G 2025\n\n|   1 | Respond to Recovering  Demand for Commercial  Airplanes and for New  Demand   | Reorganize production bases for airplane  (securing personnel) and gain new demands  such as UAM and next generation aircraft  programs                                       |\n|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2 | Capture Expanding  Industrial Market                                          | Increase production capacity to capture  growing demand for industrial applications  such as pressure vessel (CHG), wind turbine  blades, and centrifuge                      |\n|   3 | Business Structure Reform  without Overdependence on  Aerospace Applications  | Expand production and sales for industrial  and sports applications after aircraft demand  recovers, and shift to business without over- dependence on aerospace applications |\n|   4 | Strengthen Regional  Cooperation                                              | Improve services by strengthening collab- oration among regional subsidiaries in the  Americas (CMA - TAC-G) and Europe (CFE -  CIT - DELTA - EACC)                           |\n|   5 | Develop a Road Map for  Carbon Neutrality                                     | Achieve carbon-neutrality in Europe (CFE)  by 2040 and entire carbon fiber composites  businesses by 2050                                                                     |\n|   6 | Improve Compliance                                                            | Improve operation of security trade control  and quality control, etc.                                                                                                        |\n\n## Capturing the Recovery in Aircraft Demand\n\nIn light of the subsiding impact of the pandemic and the likelihood of a rapid recovery in passenger demand, both Boeing and Airbus announced plans to gradually increase production of existing models through to 2025. In addition, the development of next-generation aircraft that can further reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is expected by the beginning of 2030. To capitalize on the recovery in existing model demand, we will focus on preferential production from existing qualified material production lines. Responding without delay, we will steadily increase  capacity  of  existing  regular  tow  machines in a bid to minimize the impact on other applications. Moreover, we will work to address R&D and marketing issues related to the development and selection of materials with a view to obtaining material qualification for the next-generation aircraft program from 2025.\n\n## Reforming the Group's Business Structure\n\nAerospace applications accounted for 55% of the marginal  profit  of  the  carbon  fiber  composite  materials business in FY 2019. With 64% of the Group's regular tow dependent on aircraft and aerospace applications, results  under  AP-G  2022  were  significantly  a/ffected by COVID-19. Under AP-G 2025, we therefore intend to build a balanced earnings base that does not overly depend on aircraft applications. With the aim of improving our business portfolio, we will focus on capturing",

Our strengths in this business also include the quality and reliability of data accumulated over 50 years and our development proposal capabilities encompassing regular and large tow as well as such diverse intermediate materials and composites as thermoplastic and thermoset resins. While taking full advantage of these inherent strengths against the growing emergence of competing manufacturers, we will work to increase our production capacity and production lines at optimal locations and promote the development of innovative processes in order to enhance our cost competitiveness. As a part of e/fforts to enhance our quality capabilities, we will not only focus on creating leading-edge material and products, but also on such activities as improving our carbon footprint.\n\n## Road to Carbon Neutrality\n\nAs a leading carbon fiber company, Toray will promote a progressive approach toward carbon neutrality. In line with the Toray Group Sustainability Vision, our policy is to reduce mainly Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions by over 30% from the current level by 2030. Moreover, we intend to initiate the production of recycled carbon fiber in Europe and the U.S. with the ultimate goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Meanwhile, we will quantify the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) improvement e/ffects on customers' products and clarify Toray's contribution.\n\n## Demand for Carbon Fiber in Full Swing from 2026\n\nAs previously mentioned, Toray Group has identified various policies for its carbon fiber composite materials business under AP-G 2025. Guided by these policies, we will strengthen our business structure by capturing\n\nthe recovery in demand for commercial aircrafts and expanding  high-added-value  products.  In  addition  to expanding the scale of business through large-scale capital investments, we will also promote further cost reductions. Based on these endeavors, Toray Group is targeting revenue of \u00a5370 billion in FY 2025, an increase of \u00a588.3 billion compared with FY 2022. From a profit perspective,  the  Group  is  targeting  core  operating income of \u00a536 billion in FY 2025, up \u00a520.1 billion compared with FY 2022.\n\nDemand for carbon fiber is projected to fully expand from 2026. Applications that are expected to drive this demand include hydrogen tanks and urban air mobility (UAM) flying vehicle development, which are estimated to increase four-fold (90,000 tons) and 10 times (2,000 tons), respectively, by 2030 compared with 2025, as well as next-generation aircraft, which are anticipated to expand to 3,000 tons around 2030. In light of conditions as they currently stand, the three-year term of AP-G 2025 is positioned as a preparatory period that Toray Group will take all steps to capture this potential demand, and we will continue to put in place a sound business base and promote environmental measures to address wide-ranging issues such as carbon neutrality.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Toray Group develops, produces, and sells various membrane products of di/fferent diameters entirely in-house in accordance with the substances to be separated during water  treatment,  from  reverse  osmosis  (RO)  membranes to nanofiltration (NF) membranes, ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, and microfiltration (MF) membranes. In this way, it designs the optimal system in accordance with the water source and application to achieve the highest performance in an economical manner. The second strength is its global integrated operation system for production, sales, and technology. Through an organization consisting of five locations globally, the Group reliably supplies high-quality products and o/ffers detailed customer support in a timely manner. It has also established R&D bases beyond Japan in China and India, and is committed to developing new products that align with the water quality and needs of each region.\n\n- * IMS: Integrated Membrane System\n\n## IMS (Integrated Membrane System)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RO Membrane Demand to Grow at an Annual Rate of 5%\n\nDemand for mainstay RO membranes is anticipated to grow at an annual rate of 5% through 2025. As the largest market, China is expected to see greater demand even as applications change, including the launch of applications for new energy in contrast to a contraction in applications for thermal power generation as the country aims to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. Moreover, the\n\nU.S. market is experiencing growing demand for sewage and wastewater reuse as a countermeasure for droughts, especially on the West Coast, whereas the Middle East market continues to construct large-scale seawater desalination plants, leading to an outlook for strong demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Main Initiatives of AP-G 2025\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, the Group aims to increase market share and secure profitability by (1) expanding business and solving social issues, (2) enhancing activities in growth business fields and growth applications, (3) strengthening price and non-price competitiveness, and (4) enhancing its sales network and the sophistication of its sales methods. In addition, the Group supports these e/fforts by (5) strengthening its organizational power and governance.\n\n## Five Major Issues\n\n|   1 | Business expansion  and solving social  issues                   | \u00b7 Achieve top market share in RO business \u00b7 Enhance activities in growing water reuse field \u00b7  Development of brine mining technology and study of  product recycling                                       |\n|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2 | Enhance activities  in growth areas and  growth applications     | \u00b7  Promote global business development in growth fields  such as Water reuse, ultrapure water for semiconductors \u00b7  Keep No.1 position of SWRO and further enhance our  presence in China and the US market |\n|   3 | Strengthen price  and non-price  competitiveness                 | \u00b7 Development of high-added-value products \u00b7 Promote thorough cost reduction \u00b7  Development of drastic cost reduction technology for  the future                                                            |\n|   4 | Enhance our  sales network and  sophistication of  sales methods | \u00b7  Strengthen web and digital marketing \u00b7  Expand maintenance warranty sales using ICT  technology \u00b7  Enhance collaboration with partners                                                                   |\n|   5 | Strengthen  organizational power  & governance                   | \u00b7  Provide opportunities and HR development for young  employees \u00b7  Strengthen quality management systems                                                                                                   |\n\n## Growth Driver Strategies\n\n## Aiming for the Top Global Share of RO Membranes\n\nIn the mainstay RO membrane business, the Group operates through an organization consisting of five locations globally in order to accelerate the development of highadded-value products that reflect customer needs in a",

        "page_content": "timely manner. Similarly, it will use this organization to enhance sales activities for priority applications and to construct global supply chains in a way that aligns with sales expansion. In addition to promoting cost reductions, the Group also works to further strengthen non-price competitiveness by enhancing its technical services. In short, the Group will globally deploy technical services that integrate everything from technology proposals for customers to support for the use of these technologies via after-sales services. Through these e/fforts, the Group aims to capture the top global share of the RO membrane market in 2025.\n\n## Enhancing Sales Activities for Sewage and Wastewater Reuse Applications\n\nSince the start of the 2000s, e/fforts to reuse sewage and wastewater, especially in countries and regions su/ffering from drought, have accelerated. Compared to seawater desalination, sewage and wastewater reuse costs about one-third and it is easier to obtain the raw water, even in inland areas. Moreover, water reuse helps reduce environmental impact by curtailing wastewater discharge, which has led the market to expand at a pace exceeding at an annual rate of 10%. For example, with its poor access to water resources, Singapore began operating an advanced treatment plant called 'NEWater,' which even enables sewage water to be used as drinking water. In addition to developing new products and making IMS proposals, the Group is working to strengthen its ability to communicate through a dedicated website and to allocate resources in a focused manner as a means of incorporating demand for these applications scattered among di/fferent regions.\n\n## Global Approach to Ultrapure Water Applications for Semiconductors\n\nUltrapure  water  applications  for  semiconductors  are another growth application. E/fforts centered on Europe and the U.S. to attract and build semiconductor plants in their own countries have been gathering strength. At the same time, as the performance of semiconductors improves and the fabrication process evolves, more advanced requirements are being placed on the cleaning water used at each stage of the production process, thereby increasing the need for ultrapure water. In response to these demands, Toray Group developed a new product that significantly enhances the ability to remove silica and other substances from water that cause lower yields during semiconductor fabrication cleaning processes. Along with implementing intensive promotional activities for this product and developing more e/ffective energy-saving products, the Group aims to expand business activities for ultrapure water production applications for semiconductors.\n\n## Maintaining the De Facto Standard Position for Seawater Desalination\n\nIn addition to increasing demand for water stemming from a  growing  population  and  industrial  development  policies, rising environmental awareness means the Middle East continues to construct large-scale seawater desalination plants using the RO membrane method, which generates few CO2 emissions. This trend in seawater desalination applications is also spreading not only in the Middle East but also in North Africa against the backdrop of skyrocketing energy prices. Moreover, RO membrane\n\nreplacement demand from large-scale desalination plants is expected to increase in line with the accumulation of new plants. Although Toray's technology has succeeded in becoming the de facto standard for seawater desalination applications and has captured an overwhelming majority share, Toray Group will continue to construct supply chains that correspond to this growth in demand, become the accepted provider of specifications for replacement demand through technical service enhancements, and engage in e/fforts aimed at a further shift to localization and uncompromising cost reductions. In this way, the Group will solidify the de facto standard position.\n\nUnder AP-G 2022, the Group enhanced its systems for local production for local consumption and steadily promoted enhancements to its business structure, thereby achieving business expansion that exceeded the target. Under AP-G 2025, the Group will continue to promote the expansion of business activities for all growth applications, centered on the RO membrane business, with the aim of increasing revenues approximately 1.2 times over the three years. At the same time, the Group will contribute to the achievement of sustainability targets and to the realization of carbon neutrality through business expansion.\n\n| Sustainability Target                                                           | FY 2013  (Baseline year)   | FY 2022   | FY 2025 Target   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|------------------|\n| Water filtration throughput  contribution by Toray's water  treatment membranes | 27.23 million tons/day     | 2.4-fold  | 2.9-fold         |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Toray Group's technologies in fibers, membranes, and surface processing are primarily brought together  in  the  fields  of  dialysis  and  blood  purification. In addition to Japan, we possess production facilities for dialyzers and dialysis machines in China, and besides that in Japan sales bases in the United States, Europe, China, South Korea, and Singapore. The main tasks for AP-G 2025 include: improving the functions of and obtaining additional indications for existing products while developing their overseas business; the steady launch of the diagnostic business; and the provision of high-added-value services by utilizing DX/AI.\n\n*REMITCH\u00ae is a registered trademark of Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\n\n## Priority Measures\n\n- \u00b7  Improve functions, obtain additional indications and develop overseas business of existing products\n- \u00b7  Create maximum value utilizing exiting assets (tangible and intangible)\n- \u00b7 Launch of the diagnostic business\n- \u00b7  Identify growth areas, provide high-added-value services utilizing DX/AI, strengthen solution proposals and expand business and product development in the oncology field.\n- \u00b7  Develop environmentally friendly products\n- \u00b7  Place top priority on quality, foster competitiveness led by innovative cost reduction technology\n\n## Promoting New Product Development\n\n## Pancreatic Cancer Diagnostics Kit\n\nHaving obtained marketing approval for Toray APOA2iTQ, an in vitro diagnostic test kit that assists in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, domestic sales will begin once insurance coverage becomes available. Pancreatic cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Japan with approximately 38,000 per year (2020). An extremely serious disease without noticeable symptoms and a fiveyear survival rate in advanced stages III and IV of less than 10%, we believe that the social significance of new\n\nIn Vitro Diagnostics Kit developments that assist in its early detection will be extremely high.\n\n## Nucleic Acid Drug\n\nCurrently under development, a nucleic acid drug (TRK250) that aims to inhibit the progression of lung fibrosis has completed Phase I clinical trials in the United States. Improved biostability, which had been an issue with previous nucleic acid drugs, and e/fficient delivery to target tissue-by being administered directly to the lungs as an inhalant-is expected of this new-concept pharmaceutical that has received orphan drug designation from the FDA in the United States. Inhaled by means of a nebulizer, there is almost no systemic exposure and the risk from potential side e/ffects is expected to be low, so we aim to acquire a business partner and conduct the next phase of clinical trials.\n\n## Adhesion Barrier\n\nWe are promoting as open innovation an adhesion barrier (TRM-270C) for use in surgical operations that combines Toray's fiber and film processing technologies with the polymer nanosheet technology of Nanotheta Co., Ltd., a start-up from Waseda University. Featuring both flexibility and good adhesion to organs-due to its laminated structure of an anti-adhesion layer made of biodegradable resin and a support layer made of water-soluble resinwe are developing this product as a medical device that provides the necessary handling in laparoscopic surgery and in robot-assisted surgery, which has been increasing in recent years. Clinical trials having commenced in the gastroenterology field in 2022, we are also organizing clinical trials in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.\n\n## Strengthening the Dialysis Business\n\nIn our core dialysis business, we are focusing on developing a new system that will contribute to improved patient  satisfaction,  ease  the  burden  on  healthcare providers, and reduce costs (time). The AI-based analysis system utilizes big data to select, depending on the patient's condition, the appropriate dialysis membrane, adjust the amount of fluid removed and blood flow in real time, and even to predict falls in blood pressure during treatment. We are also demonstrating our strengths as the only manufacturer in Japan that covers the full range of dialysis-related needs, from reverse osmosis (RO) tap water treatment equipment to dialysis machines. In addition to evolving an artificial dialysis management system that links a series of devices with electronic medical records, we have developed a",

Since this condition can cause cerebral infarction, heart failure, and dementia, there is a growing need for a curative ablation treatment. Toray launched the world's first hot balloon ablation catheter (HotBalloon\u2122) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Using cauterization through thermal conduction, HotBalloon\u2122 has been praised for its potential in reducing the risk of recurrence due to uneven cauterization. Having obtained insurance coverage not only for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation but also for persistent atrial fibrillation, physician-led clinical research is being commenced. Also developing a better operable second-generation product that will maintain the same level of safety and e/ffectiveness, we are planning for its market launch in FY 2023.\n\n## Global ablation market (Estimate by Toray)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Aiming for Revenue of \u00a5100 billion or More around 2030\n\nAmid the e/ffects of soaring and persistently high raw material and fuel prices, and the NHI drug revision and reimbursement prices revision, under AP-G 2022, we secured earnings by promoting high-added-value sales, expanding  indications  and  areas,  and  appropriately responding to medical facilities and government stockpiling projects during COVID-19. However, core operating income was sluggish. To escape from this situation, in AP-G 2025, we aim to achieve revenue of \u00a560 billion\n\nand core operating income of \u00a52 billion by accelerating the overseas expansion and getting additional indications for existing products, strengthening the dialysis business, and sales of diagnostics.\n\nAs our long-term vision around 2030, we will pursue business expansion by means of global launch and sales expansion  in  the  diagnostics  business,  accelerated overseas expansion and through getting additional indications for existing products, and the development of environmentally-friendly products. In addition, we pursue business expansion through new product launches and solution services. We aim to achieve revenue of \u00a5100 billion and will work to transform our business into a highly profitable one. Specifically, we will pursue synergetic e/ffect among pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and medical devices with nucleic acid science at the core. In the blood purification field, we will increase our competitiveness through high functionality, minimization, and recycling design, and accelerate the expansion of the dialysis business through the use of DX/AI.\n\n## Revenue Plan of the Life Science Segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hirofumi Kobayashi\n\nSenior Vice President General Manager, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Products Division\n\nT\n\nora\n\ny Industries, Inc.\n\n55\n\nT\n\nora\n\ny R\n\neport 2023",

        "page_content": "## Human Resources Management\n\nBased on the thinking that the success or failure of a company is decided by its people, and employees shape its destiny, Toray positions human resources as its most important management resource. At the same time making the securing and development of human resources its most important management issue, the Company is promoting human resource strategies in an integrated manner with its management strategies.\n\nOn the path from the development to the commercialization of advanced materials, the involvement over the medium- to long-term of human resources who possess a range of abilities remains essential. The Company is leveraging the advantages of Japan's membership-type employment system, where the company protects jobs, employees can work with peace of mind, and teamwork is valued. At the same time, we aim to create organizations and workplaces that incorporate flexible employment structures, where each and every employee can feel fulfilled with their own abilities and develop their own careers, and where they can work as teams to achieve major goals.\n\n## Strengthening of Human Resources Development 1\n\n## Development of Next-generation Management Leaders\n\nToray is systematically training successor candidates who can take charge of the next generation of management. Toray Management School, which opened in 1991, selects 20 section managers every year. In addition to helping the candidates acquire the knowledge and skills essential for corporate  management,  the  School  also  improves  their problem-setting and problem-solving abilities through joint research in which themes are selected by groups. 600 graduates including 35 women have gained practical management experience at Japanese and overseas group companies, and 179 have gone on to take up management positions at Toray and its Japanese and overseas group companies. Current President Mitsuo Ohya is also one of the School's graduates. In 2006, we also launched the Toray Group Management School for division and department managers of Japanese group  companies  and  candidates  for  management  succession at the Toray Synthetic Textile Cluster. In 2021, we launched  Management  Training  for  General  Managers, geared toward those who are about to be promoted to the senior management level of Toray Group.\n\n## Expanding and Raising Level of Core Human Resources Charged with Front-line Workplace Competency\n\nHaving systemized OJT, OFF-JT, self-development, and personnel systems and measures, Toray is developing its human resources by linking each of these systems. We have prepared training programs for employees at all levels in all fields with the aim of improving and strengthening specialized capabilities, such as in management, sales, accounting, technology development and production management as well as in global capabilities. At the same time, we are making it\n\npossible for key human resources candidates, who will be responsible for front-line workplace competency, to attend training sessions and other activities in a planned manner. In particular, we are focusing on the development of professionals with advanced expertise, technical skills and originality in problem solving, of leaders who act with foresight, leadership and a sense of balance, and of human resources who can play an active role in global business .\n\n## Career Path Worksheets that Support Self-Reliant Career Development\n\nToray introduced the career path worksheet as a tool to support the growth of each and every employee. Employees draw up their own career plans and, through interviews with their superiors, verify their past work experience and their current level of achievement in relation to the required skills as well as discuss their career prospects. Based on that content, superiors also formulate training plans for their subordinates, thereby creating a system to support subordinates in their work execution and career development. Furthermore, we have adopted a self-declaration system as part of our job rotation system, allowing employees to apply for a transfer every year to advance their careers. In this way, we are incorporating human resources development measures that support the self-reliant career development of our employees and promoting the creation of a highly motivated, highly productive organization.\n\n## Fostering Mindset to Face Challenges through In-house Recruitment System\n\nIn addition to supporting self-reliant career development, Toray is also conducting internal recruitment with the aim of fostering the mindset to face challenges. Job openings are posted on the Company's intranet, and employees who have been employed in their current position for three years or more are free to apply. Every year, many employees are taking advantage of this open recruitment system to achieve transfers across fields and types of occupation.\n\n## Company-wide Training Course Enrollment in FY 2022\n\n|                                       | Persons enrolled   | Persons enrolled   | Persons enrolled   | Time dedicated                    |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Training category                     | Men                | Women              | Total              | to training  per employee  (hour) |\n| Management                            | 699                | 59                 | 758                | 44.8                              |\n| Sales, marketing, and  administration | 262                | 74                 | 336                | 20.2                              |\n| Technical                             | 620                | 84                 | 704                | 29.0                              |\n| Global                                | 74                 | 12                 | 86                 | 50.2                              |\n| Total                                 | 1,655              | 229                | 1,884              | 34.7                              |\n| Out  of  the Total,  Digital Training | 238                | 24                 | 262                | 27.0                              |",

Developing human resources into executives who understand and can put Toray's management philosophy and policies into practice, we are actively promoting people to management positions, including executive positions at Toray's headquarters. We are also conducting human resources  development  overseas  through  both  OJT  and OFF-JT. In addition to training sessions at each company, by means of OFF-JT we are regularly holding group training sessions by region and rank as well as holding training sessions in Japan for directors and executives. Furthermore, we are also providing career development through international personnel rotations. At the present time, two local sta/ff members have been appointed as Toray executive o/fficers, and five have followed the executive o/fficers as directors. At group companies around the world, local sta/ff account for 60% of executive positions, including departmental managers, factory managers and above, in Europe and the United States, and 45% in Asia.\n\n## Accelerating Promotion of Women's Empowerment in the Workforce\n\nBy utilizing the career path worksheets to support individual skill development and planning for realizable careers, we are working to improve the retention rate of female employees and the ratio of female employees in managerial positions. We have also designed systems to minimize the di/fficulties and challenges that female employees may face, especially the impact of life events on their career development. The number of women working at Toray Group companies outside Japan is also increasing, and in FY 2022, 14 female employees were dispatched in countries and regions such as China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, in positions such as sales, legal a/ffairs, accounting, and technologies, etc.\n\nToray Group's female manager training program, which was launched in 2014, was independently planned by female general managers and to date has been held eight times. Female managers who had participated commented that it was a good opportunity to learn from a variety of role models who have the experience of responding to a variety of situations, as well as to strengthen their awareness of their own career development. In addition, male managers also participated in the most recent training session, and together they discussed career development for female employees.\n\n## Targets for Promoting Women's Empowerment in the Workforce (April 2021 to March 2026)\n\n- 1.  To increase the ratio of women in management positions year by year. The immediate specific target is to increase the ratio of women in management positions from 5.1% in FY 2020 to 6.5%.\n- 2.  The ratio of the continued employment rate of female employees to the continued employment rate of male employees is set at 1.0 for each employment management category, for employees who have been with the Company up to 10 years.\n\n## Number of  Women in Management Positions and Women as a Percentage of Total Management (Toray Industries, Inc.)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Percentage of women in unit manager or higher positions\n\n## Promoting Job Satisfaction and Supportive Workplaces 3\n\nJob satisfaction for each and every individual is connected to the source of vitality that creates new value. Through the introduction of the career path worksheet, Toray aims to become a company that supports 'finding a place for self-realization within Toray Group.'\n\nUnder AP-G 2022, we extended the Toray Philosophy (TP) Project to share and disseminate our philosophy so that each and every employee could gain the sense that they were contributing to society through their work. Under AP-G 2025, we are holding live 'REAL TALK-Everyone's Voice' events between management and employees, including the president, and launching initiatives to respect feedback from workplaces and lead to the fostering an open organizational culture.\n\nTo create supportive workplaces, we are also working to enhance and upgrade support for balancing work and life. These e/fforts includes setting up a section to showcase a variety of support system available on the WELBOX, our online employee welfare service site, so that employees, irrespective of their gender, can choose from a variety of lifestyles. In particular, systems relating to childcare, nursing care, and maternity protection have been well-developed exceeding legal requirements and easy to use.\n\n## Use of Childcare Leave (Toray Industries, Inc.)\n\n| FY                      |       |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-------------------------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of  employees    | Women |     68 |     58 |     60 |     66 |     56 |     46 |\n| taking childcare  leave | Men   |      3 |      4 |     10 |     22 |     40 |     82 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

(TMUS)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresident & CEO Toray Membrane USA,\n\n## - Please tell us your reasons for joining Toray subsidiary TMUS in the United States and your impressions of Toray Group after having joined the Company.\n\nAfter graduating from university, I worked for eight or nine years at a water treatment company, mainly as an engineer, but that company was later acquired by a major company. I joined Toray Membrane USA (TMUS) in 2008, shortly after the company was established, and the CEO at the time, who knew of me, had approached me. Even before joining the company, I had the opportunity to gain first-hand experience of Toray products and knew what kind of functions they had, and thus I rated Toray's technological capabilities very highly. At the same time, I felt that Toray had the potential to become an industry leader in the near future, so decided to join the company as a senior engineer. After joining the company and the team members, I was convinced that this startup was precisely the best place for me to demonstrate my skills. Furthermore, after joining the company, I realized that Toray Group has a vision of wanting to be successful over the long-term, not just the short-term.\n\n## - Did you have a career path to management in mind when you joined the company?\n\nTo be involved in corporate management was not what I was aiming for from the beginning. As I had majored in chemical engineering at university, I wanted to first improve my abilities as an engineer. However, as people\n\nadvance in their careers, their own areas of expertise and areas in which they have an interest broaden. At TMUS, career paths opened up for me not only in engineering but also in sales, and I became interested in that kind of work. I believe that building a career not only as an engineer but also in sales activities has led me to the position I am in today.\n\n## -Please tell us how you felt when you were appointed CEO and what your future aspirations are.\n\nAfter becoming involved in sales activities and management, I worked hard to become a CEO someday, so when I heard that I had actually been selected as CEO, I was very happy and honored to have achieved my long-held goal. On the other hand, I was a little surprised that I was selected as the CEO of a Japanese company, as I imagine at the management level, I fall into the younger category.\n\nHowever, this is my 15th year at TMUS. As I have been working my way up since the early stages of the startup, I have been able to see how this company has grown up to now and therefore believe that I have a good understanding of Toray's corporate culture as well as the current situation. Although we have grown in a short period of time from a startup to a company that can generate profits, my feeling is that we still have a lot of potential. Therefore, my goal from now on is to lead TMUS to the next chapter in its growth to make the company even bigger. This starts with a change in mindset of employees. I would like to create a company that can grow sustainably by building a foundation of thinking that looks at long-term growth, rather than simply focusing on earning immediate profit. I find this a challenging task, and am honored to have been given this opportunity.\n\n## - What do you think are the challenges that Toray Group is facing in the United States?\n\nAs a group, Toray possesses diverse, chemistry-based technologies. From there, in addition to water treatment,",

        "page_content": "Please watch the short film STRAIGHT PATH, which is based on President Huynh's true story.\n\nwe  are  expanding  our  various  businesses  globally, including textiles, carbon fiber composite materials, and functional chemicals, and are working to contribute to people's lives and society. I feel proud to be a member of the Group.\n\nWith regard to our business in the United States, I think it is good that a diverse group of local human resources is responsible for the management of the group companies. This is because we local human resources have a good understanding of the culture and people of each region and exert an important presence in the success of our business.\n\nOn the other hand, although a major company with world-class technology at its disposal, Toray is not well known in the United States. Additionally, there is little communication or collaboration between the local group companies, giving the impression that each company is developing its business independently. This often places them at a distinct disadvantage when competing against huge corporate groups. If the group companies in each region were closely connected and pooled their resources, we could expect various synergies between our businesses and be able to increase our competitiveness as a group. I also think that Toray's name recognition would improve by becoming more active as a group. Therefore, I think what is needed is more collaboration and cooperation among the local companies.\n\n## - What strengths does TMUS possess in the United States?\n\nI mentioned that there is room for improvement in increasing Toray's name recognition in the United States. When it comes to the water treatment industry, Toray's products such as hollow fiber ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes have extremely high performance, and the technological capabilities backed by these achievements are undoubtedly recognized as a brand. This is where TMUS's greatest strength lies. In the water treatment industry, however, companies are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nundergoing consolidation, and there are cases in which small  companies  have  pooled  a  variety  of  technologies and grown into major companies. In an increasing number of cases, such companies are proposing a variety of packaged solutions. For TMUS to adapt to these changes in the competitive environment and exhibit further growth, I believe it is important to strengthen partnerships not only of course within the Group but also outside the Group and with our customers, while aiming to create more value than we could do alone.\n\n## - Lastly, could you please give a message to those who will join Toray Group in the years to come.\n\nLooking back on my journey, the first thing I would like to say to everyone who joins Toray Group is to view working at Toray as a long-term commitment rather than a shortterm. I do not recommend Toray to people who think that once they find the job they want, they can just move on to the next one. However, it is a great place for people who want to build their career over the long term.\n\nConversely, for those people who want to grow and improve themselves at Toray, a long-term commitment is essential. In other words, it will be necessary to find opportunities to contribute to the challenges Toray is facing and increase their own value while gaining knowledge, skills, and experience. I believe that this is the meaning of long-term commitment and that will also lead to an attachment and loyalty to the Company. This has also provided a driving force in my own career.\n\nHaving begun its life as a startup, TMUS is now entering a period of generational shift. In addition to the active participation of mid-level employees, nurturing the younger generation has become an issue. In the meantime, the business environment is constantly changing, and if we stand still, we will soon be left behind. Under these circumstances, I would like to give back to Toray and will do my utmost to make the necessary changes and bring about evolution to grow TMUS in a sustainable manner.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Started by former President Akihiro Nikkaku, President Mitsuo Ohya has continued this initiative, answering questions from employees.\n\nEmployee questions are wide-ranging, from serious workplace inquires such as 'What do you think about the fact that we sometimes have to spend an inordinate amount of time preparing documents to respond to random comments from upper management, making it di/fficult to concentrate on our main duties?,' 'How do you plan to address aging production facilities?,' 'What are your measures to deal with personnel shortages?' to everyday queries like 'How does the president spend his days o/ff?' and 'What is the president's daily schedule?' The president also answers questions received via the live chat on the day of the livestream.\n\nREAL TALK livestreams were held twice in FY 2022 and are scheduled to be held a total of six times in FY 2023, including at our factories. REAL TALK provides a valuable opportunity for employees to interact with President. REAL TALK has been well received by many employees, with positive comments including: 'I felt closer to the president,' 'I got a glimpse of the president's thoughts and personality,'  'The  atmosphere  felt  free  and  open,' 'These sessions will likely improve communication skills Group-wide,' and 'The president expressed his frank opinions about workplace issues.' In post-livestream surveys, 90% of employees responded that the program was 'very good' or 'good.'\n\n## Post-livestream survey results (average of previous 6 surveys)\n\nFair/Not very good/Not good\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs for his impressions of the livestream, President Ohya said: 'I listen to the opinions of all employees, including younger ones, very closely.

https://www.toray.co.jp/sustainability/tcfd/\n- *2  Items that are di/fficult to estimate quantitatively with a certain degree of accuracy are classified into the following three levels (large, medium and small) according to the magnitude of their impact on sales revenue or business profit.\n- Large (L): Sales revenue of 50 billion yen or more or business profit of 5 billion yen or more\n- Medium (M): Sales revenue of 10 billion yen or more but less than 50 billion yen, or business profit of 1 billion yen or more but less than 5 billion yen\n- Small (S): Sales revenue less than 10 billion yen or business profit less than 1 billion yen\n\nThe impact on revenue was analyzed for the sales aspect, and the impact on business profit was analyzed for the cost aspect. In cases where the same size classification for each climate scenario was considered to have varying degrees of impact within that classification, a gradient was used, with darker colors used for those deemed to have a greater impact. The gradient represents changes within the same category of 'social change' and does not represent di/fferences in the magnitude of impact between di/fferent categories.\n\n## KPIs and Targets\n\nToray Group has set forth its quantitative targets for FY 2030 in the Toray Group Sustainability Vision. In addition, as the milestone for the Vision, it has disclosed the results for FY\n\n2022, as well as targets for FY 2025 as the interim target in the Medium-Term Management Program, Project AP-G 2025 (See P.23 and P.27).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this respect, Toray Group practices life cycle management (LCM).\n\nLCM is the basis for Sustainability Innovation (SI) products, and the Group has adopted life cycle assessment *1 and the Toray Eco-E/fficiency Analysis (T-E2A) *2 tool and is working to establish LCM as a tool to measure CO2 reduction in the entire life cycle of products and services. Products are certified as SI products through a two-stage screening process by the divisional committees and the Sustainability Innovation Certification Committee (provisional name) as the successor to the Green Innovation Certification Committee. Only those products determined to be e/ffective solutions for global environmental issues through this process as based on objective evidence are certified.\n\n- *1  Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a method for quantitatively assessing the resources that have gone into a product and the impact the product will have on the environment and ecosystems over its life cycle.\n\n## Environmental Accounting\n\nToray  has  been  practicing  environmental  accounting  since 1999, to track investments and gauge their cost e/ffectiveness. The value of environmental facility investments in FY 2022\n\namounted to \u00a51.49 billion, a decline of \u00a5330 million over the previous fiscal year, while environmental preservation costs amounted to \u00a59.26 billion, an increase of \u00a52.51 billion.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Initiatives\n\nAs its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for CSR Roadmap 2022, Toray Group presented the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue by 20% *1 compared with FY 2013 levels for the entire Toray Group on a continuous basis through FY 2022, and implemented systematic reduction measures.\n\nGreenhouse  gas  emissions  for  the  entire  Toray  Group during FY 2022 decreased 10.9% over the previous fiscal year to 4.89 million tons-CO2.\n\nToray  Group  minimized  greenhouse  gas  emissions  per unit  of  revenue  by  increasing  group-wide  revenue  and  by implementing initiatives intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  (promotion  of  energy  savings  through  process improvements, use of renewable energy, reduction of coal use at overseas plants, etc.), and thereby decreased emissions 34.6% *2 compared with FY 2013 levels.\n\nIn FY 2022, Toray and its group companies in Japan reduced greenhouse gas emissions 16.1% over the previous fiscal year by bolstering the e/fficiency of energy consumption and by reducing waste and loss. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of revenue improved 9.2% over the previous fiscal year thanks to higher revenue and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These e/fforts resulted in a 33.2% decline compared with FY 2013.\n\n## Installing Renewable Energy Systems\n\nToray Group is systematically installing renewable energy systems. The Group installed a solar power generation system at Toray Plastics Precision (Zhongshan) Ltd., in FY 2020, as well\n\nas at Seta Plant 3 and Toray Precision Co., Ltd., in FY 2021, and respectively started operation. In addition, Tokai Plant began co-combusting sludge fuel as boiler fuel from FY 2017.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Per-Unit-of Net Sales (Per-Unit-of Revenue) (Toray Group) *3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Greenhouse gas emissions per-unit-of net sales (per-unit-of revenue)\n- *1 For Scope 1 and 2\n- *2  Until FY 2022, this was calculated by multiplying the GHG emissions and revenue of individual subsidiaries worldwide by the applicable Toray Industries' equity share. Starting in FY 2023 however, the calculation method will change, and the degree of financial control Toray Industries has over the individual subsidiary (not the equity share) will be used, in accordance with the GHG Protocol, the international standard.\n- *3  Until FY 2019, emissions per unit of sales were used due to the adoption of Japanese accounting standards. Since FY 2020, however, emissions per unit of revenue have been used due to the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Moreover, values for FY 2013 as the baseline year are calculated by including emissions and revenues from companies that joined Toray Group during or after FY 2014.\n\n## Toray's Life Cycle Management Approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *2  T-E2A is an environmental analysis tool developed by Toray Industries, Inc.

This move has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 1,500 tons-CO2 annually on a global basis.\n\n## Energy Conservation Measures\n\nToray is vigorously working on energy conservation activities with the goal of reducing its per-unit energy consumption *1 by 2% annually. Although energy consumption declined 5.9% in FY 2022 as a result of promoting greater energy consumption e/fficiency and reducing waste and loss, per-unit energy consumption worsened 6.9% due to a decline of 12.0% in production volumes. Meanwhile, compared with FY 1990, the baseline year for reductions in per-unit energy consumption, this is an improvement of 14.6%.\n\nToray Group organizes energy conservation teams to help carry out annual energy conservation diagnostics at plants in Toray and its group companies around the world. In FY 2022, the Group conducted these activities at five of Toray's plants, three group company plants in Japan, and four group company plants around the world. The energy savings thereof e/ffectively reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than approximately 10,000 tons-CO2 per year.\n\n## Biodiversity Initiatives\n\nNext to the issue of climate change, the issue of biodiversity preservation has been a major focus of the international community in recent years. Biodiversity forms the basis of natural capital such as water, air, plants, animals, and minerals that are indispensable to human society. Climate change caused by human activities, depletion of natural resources, ecosystem destruction, and species extinction are causing biodiversity loss to occur at an alarming rate, making it a serious problem facing humankind. This has sparked an international discussion about the importance of taking a nature positive approach to stopping and reversing biodiversity loss.\n\nToray Group views conservation of biodiversity as a critical global environmental issue which is as just important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Toray is contributing to the biodiversity conservation and nature positive approach through its business activities. This includes water treatment technology\n\n## Energy Consumption and Per-unit Energy Consumption Index (Toray Industries, Inc.) *2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *1 Energy consumption per converted production volume\n\n*2 The energy consumption shown in this graph does not include renewable energy.\n\nto produce reliably safe drinking water, water conservation through the reuse of treated wastewater, and air purification using filter-related materials.\n\nThe Group also uses environmental assessment checklists to conduct safety reviews for all products and to carry out environmental risk investigations before making capital investment. The checklists enable the Group to ensure that it is not exceeding legal limits on regulated substances contained in exhaust gas, wastewater, and waste from manufacturing. When assessing new land use, the checklists cover items related to biodiversity, including regulations at production bases, the necessity for surveys on rare species, and any requests from citizen groups, among other considerations. Through these e/fforts, Toray strives to assess its impact on biodiversity and help build a sustainable world.\n\n## Newly establishing the Environmental Solutions Department within the Corporate Marketing Planning Division\n\nYuriko Teshigawara\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral Manager, Environmental Solutions Department\n\nUnder the Toray Group Sustainability Vision, Toray Group is engaged in group-wide initiatives geared toward combating climate change and promoting a circular economy. In June 2022, the Group established the Environmental Solutions Department within the Corporate Marketing Planning Division to serve as the headquarters for using the strengths of the Group's businesses to their fullest through an approach to marketing and supply chain management that cuts across its businesses. In working toward the realization of a circular economy, the Group must tackle issues in its Fibers & Textiles, Resins, Films, and other business divisions, while at the same time charting the optimization of group-wide policies for polyester, nylon, and other polymers on an individual basis. The primary mission of the Environmental Solutions Department is to build a value chain that straddles each department regarding issues involved in securing resources for recycling, developing technologies, and commercialization, and to realize systems that connect the value chain to revenue and profits. At the same time, the Group launched the Circular Economy Subcommittee led by the Executive Vice President in charge of Marketing & Sales to debate policies involving Toray initiatives for a circular economy. The subcommittee has been working to achieve the targets raised by the Group for 2030, namely a revenue target of \u00a5400 billion for products that facilitate sustainable, recycling-based use of resources and production, and a target of 20% for the percentage of raw materials sourced from recycling used in Toray core polymers *1 .\n\n*1 The ratio of PET and nylon polymer raw materials sourced from recycling, derived from biomass, or produced with CO2 recycling.",

In this event, these three speakers gave presentations: Satoru Hagiwara, Executive Vice President and Representative Member of the Board, Keisuke Ishii, General Manager, Torayca Division, and Kozo Takahashi, General Manager, HS Division.\n\n## Hydrogen Is the Key to Fulfilling Carbon Neutrality\n\nIn 2050, in the world that has achieved carbon neutrality, the primary energy source will have completely shifted from fossil fuels to wind, solar, and other forms of renewable energy. Moreover, hydrogen will have come to play an important role as a source of clean power, a carrier of clean power, and as a form of secondary energy.\n\n## /fffifi Hydrogen Long-term Demand Forecast (upper) and Transition to Clean Hydrogen (lower)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Green hydrogen and blue hydrogen are collectively called 'clean hydrogen.'\n\n## Developing and Manufacturing a Wide Range of Core Materials Used throughout the Hydrogen Supply Chain\n\nThe  feature  of  Toray's  hydrogen-related  businesses  is  the range of products it o/ffers across the entire supply chain, from production to transportation, storage, and use. For example, Toray's carbon fibers are required for the wind power used to generate green electricity employed to produce hydrogen, while its water treatment membranes are used to produce water that serves as the raw material. The water electrolyzers, which are expected to expand in the future, include alkaline (ALK) and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) types. Toray is working to apply its core materials such as diaphragms, polymer electrolyte membranes, catalyst coated membranes (CCM), electrodes, subgasket films for these electrolyzers. In\n\nregard to hydrogen transportation and storage, Toray provides carbon fibers and plastic liners of which high-pressure tanks are made, while in terms of use it delivers the core materials that are similar to those used in fuel cells.\n\nThe primary driver for expansion of green hydrogen is realization of parity pricing (pricing that can compete with existing fuels). As part of its e/fforts to realize a hydrogen society, Toray therefore provides advanced materials as solutions that facilitate the answers to the challenge of increasing the availability of lower cost clean hydrogen to a wide range of customers throughout the supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToray's technologies and products\n\nCCM : Catalyst Coated Membrane, CP : Carbon Paper, GDL : Gas Di/ffusion Layer, MEA : Membrane Electrode Assembly\n\n## Satoru Hagiwara\n\nExecutive Vice President and Representative Member of the Board, CTO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlready, the trend toward real-world implementation of clean hydrogen is spreading among countries across the globe, with the number of related projects exceeding 1,000 and amounting to a total investment of \u00a545 trillion. Over the coming decade, real-world usage will progress centered on green hydrogen, which is produced by water electrolysis using renewable energy, where replacement of existing demand for ammonia and other raw materials will begin. Following on this, new demand will emerge as each sector begins to convert to hydrogen use, after which up-scaling and cost reductions are expected to progress. The hydrogen society will then enter a period of rapid expansion, driving the hydrogen market to a scale of 500 million tons per year in 2050, five times of its size today. Green hydrogen is expected to account for 80% of the total.\n\n67",

Moreover, Toray holds a leading industry share for carbon fibers used in gas tanks; carbon paper (CP), gas di/ffusion layer (GDL), and other electrode materials used in fuel cell and water electrolysis systems; and catalyst coated membranes (CCM) / membrane electrode assembly (MEA). In addition, in 2025 the Group plans to begin mass-production of hydrocarbon (HC) electrolyte membranes, which are positioned to become a major new product.\n\nWith over 60 years of history, Toray carbon fibers were first used for natural gas as applications spread to the high-pressure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntank field, and will continue deploying into new areas with the expansion of the hydrogen market. In the field of fuel cells, the Group developed CP electrode materials for passenger vehicles, and is now working with a focus on expanding the business for heavy duty vehicles that will depend on fuel cells for decarbonization. HC electrolyte membranes have a history of 20 years, while the CCM/MEA o/ffered by Greenerity, Toray's subsidiary in Germany, have a history of 30 years.\n\nLeveraging these proprietary technologies and strengths accumulated over the years, Toray Group will enable lighter weights, higher pressure, greater reliability, better e/fficiency, improved performance, superior durability, and other forms of value for the hydrogen supply chain, which are ultimately delivered to its customers.\n\n## Converting Toray's Unique Technologies and Strengths into Customer Value\n\n- \u00b7 High performance and reliable quality based on proven track record\n- \u00b7 Global production and technical support system\n- \u00b7 Design of excellent strength, conductivity, gas permeability\n- \u00b7 Free of impurities, excellent surface quality\n- \u00b7 Design and control of polymer and membrane structure\n- \u00b7 Excellent gas barrier and proton conductivity\n- \u00b7 Design and control of catalyst layer\n\n\u00b7 Ultimate pursuit of catalyst loading reduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Promoting R&D of Innovative Technologies that Contribute to Carbon Recycling\n\nA carbon neutral world will also need to realize carbon recycling,  whereby  carbon  is  recovered  and  converted  into valuables (ammonia, methane, methanol, synthetic fuel, polymers, etc.) for use in combination with clean hydrogen. This will require separating various mixed gases into their individual components, for which Toray proposes innovative separation  membranes.  One  of  these  is  hydrogen  separation membranes. The Group has demonstrated the highest level\n\nof hydrogen purity in the world by leveraging its water treatment RO membrane technology for use in this area. Another is CO2 separation membranes, for which the Group has demonstrated basic performance in terms of heat resistance and e/fficiency, for example, and for which it is advancing to the field demonstration stage. Moreover, the Group is investigating a hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium-based bioprocess as a technology to convert the series of raw gases into valuables.\n\n## Aiming to Achieve Sales of \u00a5300 Billion in FY 2030\n\nSales for Toray Group's hydrogen-related businesses in FY 2022 amounted to around \u00a520 billion. During FY 2025, the final  year  of  Medium-Term  Management  Program,  Project AP-G 2025, the Group is targeting sales of up to \u00a560 billion, with carbon fibers for hydrogen tanks, electrode materials, and CCM/MEA as the primary growth drivers. Together with HC\n\nHigh-E/fficient Hydrogen Separation Membrane\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll-Carbon CO2 Separation Membrane\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nelectrolyte membranes, further growth in these businesses will serve as a driver in the Group's e/fforts to steadily capture the growth of the hydrogen society with the aim of achieving \u00a5300 billion sales in FY 2030.\n\n## Challenge for Expansion of Hydrogen-related Businesses\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, CP and the gas di/ffusion layer (GDL) made from CP play an important role as electrode substrate for fuel cells. In particular, fuel cell vehicles are considered to be advantageous for large trucks and other\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Demand Outlook for CP/GDL\n\ncommercial  vehicles  that  travel  long  distances because they o/ffer better payloads and range than battery EVs. Likewise, the Group anticipates significant growth in demand for carbon fibers used in high-pressure hydrogen gas tanks starting in 2026.\n\nKeisuke Ishii General Manager, Torayca Division\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecifically, the demand for carbon fibers for high-pressure gas tank applications, including those used for natural gas, is expected to expand at an annual growth rate of 42% until 2025, whereas the demand for these in 2030, when hydrogen gas tank applications will fully take-o/ff, is expected to quadruple that of 2025.\n\nMoreover, the demand for CP and GDL used in polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type water electrolyzers and fuel cells is also growing. This area is expected to expand rapidly, with demand in 2030 increasing 3.5-fold compared with 2025. Boasting a leading share of the industry, Toray's GDL has superior features compared with those of competing manufacturers, in terms of gas permeability, water transportation characteristics, high conductivity, high strength, and high surface quality. Thereby it contributes to the higher output, longer life, and improved safety of fuel cell vehicles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Initiatives of HS Division\n\n## Working to Capture the Growth of the Hydrogen Society through Hydrocarbon (HC) Electrolyte Membranes\n\nThe HS Division o/ffers the core components that are shared by water electrolyzers, hydrogen compressors, and fuel cells, namely electrolyte membranes, catalyst coated membranes (CCMs), and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) made by laminating a gas di/ffusion layer onto a CCM. Moreover, it is responsible for Greenerity (Germany) and Yamanashi Hydrogen Company (YHC). Along with establishing the basic concept of hydrocarbon (HC) electrolyte membranes\n\n## Market Outlook for Water Electrolyzer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market Outlook for Electrolyte Membrane\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat its laboratories, Toray acquired Greenerity and has since incorporated its CCM/MEA production technologies. Later on, it demonstrated this technology as part of a national project, entered a partnership with Siemens Energy, and established the HS Division as a new profit center in June 2022.\n\nKozo Takahashi General Manager, HS Division\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLeveraging proprietary polymer design, precision polymerization, and nanolevel structure control technologies, Toray conceived of HC electrolyte membranes, which contribute to significant performance improvements for PEM-type water  electrolyzers  with  superior  adaptability  to  renewable  energy  power sources. As the use of renewable energy progresses in the future, the ratio of PEM-type electrolyzers using HC electrolyte membranes will rise compared to existing alkaline-type water electrolyzers, and are therefore expected to account for 50% of the market by around 2030. The electrolyte membrane market will also grow significantly along with the increase, and is expected to reach a market scale of around \u00a5160 billion annually in 2030, of which the Group intends to capture a major portion using Toray's proprietary HC electrolyte membranes.\n\n69",

Intellectual property strategies, as a part of the strategy trinity, that conform to management principles\n\nToray Group regards intellectual property as one of its vital management resources. We have linked our intellectual property strategies mutually and organically with our business and R&D strategies, and as a component of this 'trinity,' we have positioned intellectual property strategies as one of the most important elements of our management strategies.\n\n## 2. Promoting the procurement of rights\n\nIn order to protect Toray Group's products and technologies and to ensure profits, we promote high-quality patent applications and patenting, and strive to build a strong patent network with deterrence capabilities. Regarding trademarks,  we  execute  the  acquisition  of  appropriate  rights with an eye to improving brand value. The decline in the\n\nnumber of patent applications filed during FY 2021 was due to the careful selection of filing countries in consideration of cost-e/ffectiveness.\n\n## 3. Respecting the rights of others\n\nToray operates a patent confirmation system to comprehensively investigate the relationship between its own products and technologies and patents owned by other companies to assure that there is no infringement upon the rights of other parties. We also check the relationship of our trademarks with those registered by other companies prior to use.\n\n## 4. Rightful enforcement of our own rights\n\nWhen Toray Group's patent rights are infringed upon by another party, we take proper steps depending on the circumstances by exercising our patent rights, such as demanding that infringement cease, receiving monetary profits from licensing, and using our patent rights for cross-licensing with the patent rights of other parties.\n\n## Systems and initiatives for intellectual property strategy implementation\n\nToray Group implements intellectual property strategies in line with its basic policies through the following systems, initiatives, etc.\n\n## 1.  Patent responsibility structure and global patent strategy responsibility structure\n\nToray and its major group companies appoints patent managers for each product line and technology group and have established  patent  committees  with  the  participation  of members from the Intellectual Property Division, as well as research, R&D, and marketing and sales departments. Activities  with  regard  to  filing,  patenting,  defense,  and exploitation of rights are promoted upon deliberation by the patent committees. In addition, the supervising executives in charge of technology and production in each business are appointed as global patent strategy chairperson to guide and supervise global intellectual property activities conducted by Toray and its Japanese and overseas group companies in each business.\n\n## 2.  Development and implementation of an Intellectual Property (IP) action plan\n\nUnder the guidance of global patent strategy chairperson, each business division formulates and carries out an 'IP\n\naction plan' concerning important matters on intellection property. Themes that should be given particular emphasis are selected as 'Rank-A Projects' and focused upon for promotion. The status of implementation of the IP action plan is reported once a year to the Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.  Building barriers to other companies' entry by intellectual property\n\nToray and its major domestic and overseas subsidiaries and a/ffiliated companies are strategically using patent application and patenting as well as concealment of know-how to build strong barriers to entry by other companies.\n\n## 4. Patent confirmation system\n\nWhen manufacturing or selling new products, we ensure that utilization, production, sale, etc. of our technologies and products do not infringe upon the patent or other rights of others.\n\n## 5. IP landscape initiatives\n\nIn formulating IP strategies, we are taking action to explore ways to utilize our patents, and other initiatives, such as promoting the training of personnel (IP analysts, and others) who can exploit IP landscapes, developing research tools, and also analyzing the business environment and investigating new and relevant topics.",

Ranked 16th on the '2022 Patent Asset Growth Ranking'\n\nToray ranked 16th on the 'Patent Asset Growth Ranking,' a list created by Nikkei Business Magazine consisting of the top 40 Japanese companies ranked in accordance with the degree of growth in patents held by these companies over the past two years as of the end of December 12, 2022. This ranking adopts a calculation method that combines the number of held patents with the frequency of citations made in patents filed by other companies, for example, and therefore tends to reflect trends in innovation.\n\n## 3. Patent Asset Index \u2122 Assessments\n\nLexisNexis's PatentSight\u2122 provides a Patent Asset Index\u2122 (PAI) based on the technical and market value of patent families.\n\nThe following figure illustrates the changes in the PAI for six competing companies, including Toray Group, regarding  patent  families  pertaining  to  the  SDGs  (Sustainable Development Goals). The SDGs are a set of international objectives consisting of 17 goals and 169 targets that aim to achieve a sustainable, better planet by 2030.\n\nToray Group has steadily increased the value of related patents that can contribute to the achievement of SDGs over the past 20 years, including years prior 2015 when the SDGs were first raised by the UN Summit. Since 2016, the Group has been in a superior position compared to its competitors.\n\n## PAI trend of SDGs-related patents (comparison of 6 companies)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n*Prepared by the Company using the PatentSight Patent Asset Index\u2122 of LexisNexis, Inc.\n\n## Toray intellectual property contributes solutions to global environmental issues\n\n## Separation Membrane Technology\n\nSince the 1980s, Toray has continued to create innovative separation membrane technologies for artificial kidney, reverse osmosis  (RO)  membrane,  and  other  similar  applications, where the evolution and development in these technologies has shown further expansion. The figure to the right maps the standing of patents related to separation membrane technologies held by Toray Group, and uses di/fferent colors corresponding to each technological field to indicate Toray's many patents.\n\nIn the field of membrane bioprocesses, specifically, Toray advances research into bioprocesses that fuse membrane technologies and biotechnologies in order to produce inedible sugars and chemicals from inedible biomass at high-e/fficiency while consuming less energy. At the same time, Toray has been conducting demonstrations and commercialization investigations in Thailand regarding these technologies. Toray has acquired multiple related patents (red dots) in conjunction with this development, through which it will help to realize a society that does not rely on fossil resources.\n\n## Landscape map of patents related to separation membrane technology (each dot: Toray Group patents)\n\n<!-- image -->",

After having put in place the subordinate Technology Center DX Promotion Committee and the Business DX Promotion Committee, the Company is advancing a groupwide TDX Promotion Project in addition to departmental initiatives.\n\nIn particular, we will promote utilization of data and digital technologies in a manner closely tied to the Genba (workplace) to successfully face a number of challenges, such as creating products and services that meet the needs of our customers and society, strengthening cost competitiveness, and increasing the sophistication of business management. Specifically, in addition to promoting DX themes in research and development, production, business, and management fields, we will develop a global data infrastructure and develop human resources fluent in digital technologies.\n\n## Toray Digital Transformation (TDX) Promotion Committee\n\n## Technology Center DX Promotion Committee\n\nDrive advancement and streamlining by leveraging digital technology in research and technological development (R&D), and production\n\n## Business Division DX Promotion Committee\n\nContributing to visualizing global management information in sales & marketing, finance & accounting, purchasing & logistics, and advancing business management\n\n## Investing \u00a520 Billion in DX Promotion\n\nUnder AP-G 2025, based on DX closely tied to the Genba (workplace), we will promote building of a global data infrastructure to utilize the data accumulated within Toray Group throughout the Group, integration of analysis and simulation technologies, collaboration with the value chain, and the development of more than 2,000 human resources fluent in digital technologies.\n\nIn building a global data infrastructure, we will centralize Toray Group's performance management data, including that from domestic and overseas a/ffiliates, and improve Group  governance  through  timely  monitoring  systems such as Business Intelligence (BI). By combining analysis and simulation technologies, we will work to reduce costs and improve quality through the visualization of production\n\nactivities  and  data  analysis,  and  create  new  materials through simulation informatics. In collaboration with the value chain, we will work to improve the accuracy of production and sales plans and the optimization of inventory through real-time collaboration and management, while focusing on visualizing our carbon footprint. We will also accelerate the promotion of DX in all aspects, such as in strengthening digital marketing and in managing signs of problems by utilizing AI.\n\nAs far as human resources are concerned, we will expand and upgrade the DX human resource certification system and develop human resources who understand the workplace, know how to use digital technology as a tool, and who will take the lead in improving that workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment related to digital technology: \u00a5 20\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## billion\n\n| Building a global data infrastructure           | Promoting  accumulation, sharing, and visualization  of data                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Combining analysis and simulation tech.         | Using AI and MI* to capture benefits of  digitally leveraged manufacturing      *Materials Informatics                                                                                                                                |\n| Cooperating with value chain partners           | Real-time  cooperation and management                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Development of HR fluent in  digital technology | Establishing  a base of human resources fluent in digital technologies  totaling 2,000 people group-wide \u00b7 Focusing on the development of senior leaders and leaders who are familiar with both the frontlines and digital technology |\n| Development of HR fluent in  digital technology | Over 20 people Creation of new digital methods (Professional)  Expert Level of Digital Fluency                                                                                                                                        |\n| Development of HR fluent in  digital technology | Senior Leader Over 200 people Execute from problem-setting to solution by themselves using digital methods (Leader)                                                                                                                   |\n| Development of HR fluent in  digital technology | Solving problems with basic digital methods (Field promoters) Leader Over 600 people                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Development of HR fluent in  digital technology | Associate Over 1,200 people Mastering the digital basics                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Development of HR fluent in  digital technology | General Digital Personnel                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

        "page_content": "Case 1\n\n## Apparel Business Cockpit System\n\nTo strengthen our ability to build global value chains and sales operations, which are strengths that the Toray Group has cultivated over the years, we are promoting business model reform. We are achieving this reform by working to deepen and extend our value chain by utilizing collaboration with bases outside Japan, external resources, and DX tailored to actual situations in the workplace. In supplying di/fferentiated, highly advanced processed products,\n\nwe are building an integrated supply chain data platform that  centrally  manages  data  dispersed  across  various sites, such as customer orders from major global apparel companies,  fabric  and  garment  production  schedules. This makes it possible to visualize data, act quickly on any abnormalities, improve prediction accuracy, and provide value in the form of, for example, reduced lead times and production flexibility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Development of Flame-Retardant CFRP by Means of Integrated Materials Informatics (MI) Case 2\n\nHaving utilized integrated MI, which combines MI using self-organizing maps (introduced from Tohoku University) with its proprietary multiscale simulations (MS), Toray succeeded in halving the development period for a flame-retardant carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP).\n\nSimplifying and displaying in visual form vast amounts of data, a self-organizing map arranges materials with similar characteristics close to each other. Using this feature makes it possible to analyze complex information in a form\n\nthat is easy for humans to understand. A method that combines microscale (molecular dynamics, etc.) and macroscale (CAE, etc.) simulations, using MS makes it possible to analyze phenomena from multiple angles, solve essential problems, and promote material design. Going forward, we will expand integrated MI's range of applications while accelerating the streamlining and sophistication of research and technological development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Case 3\n\n## Building of a Toray Common Data Analysis Environment\n\nData analysis such as MI and process informatics (PI) is performed in the following steps: data acquisition \u2192 accumulation \u2192 processing \u2192 analysis.  Systems  for  data acquisition and accumulation are built according to each department's operations. However, since data processing and analysis deal with organized numerical data, building of a common company-wide environment was needed from the perspective of increasing sophistication and e/fficiency of initiatives. In response, from November 2022,\n\nwe built and rolled out the Toray Common Data Analysis Environment  to  the  entire  Company.  This  is  equipped with a programming environment (Python common environment) and a proprietary data analysis tool that can be operated intuitively. Since its rollout, utilization of the Toray Common Data Analysis Environment has extended throughout Toray including technical and business departments, contributing significantly to DX promotion within the Company.\n\nData Analysis Flow\n\nData Collection Sensor Data Experiment Data External data etc.\n\nData Accumulation Numerical data Image data Chemical structure, etc. (unorganized)\n\nPython Common Environment\n\n\u00b7 Use Python without complicated environment settings \u00b7 Program templates created by experts can be used\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nToray Common Data Analysis Environment\n\nProduction E/fficiency New Material Creation\n\nData analysis\n\nData Analysis Tools\n\n\u00b7 Advanced data analysis without programming \u00b7 Intuitive GUI for easy operation\n\n75",

Rather than focusing on a single path, I have increasingly explored a wide range of avenues when encountering di/fferent fields and educational opportunities and worked to expand my scope of knowledge. If forced to comment, I would say that my expertise lies in education and economics. I was, for example, approached to become a professor at the Graduate School of Engineering at Tohoku University, not only for my expertise in engineering, but also because of my commitment to foster researchers who can look at their e/fforts from multiple perspectives, including the practical social application and business value creation of research results.\n\nMy first contact with Toray was when I was involved in developing the Science, Technology, and Innovation Basic Plan of Japan's Cabinet O/ffice. To a large part, I feel that my career has unintentionally fostered a sense of diversity as opposed to specialization, and as a result, I have become adept at examining various issues from multiple perspectives. I have also served as an outside director of Compagnie de Saint Gobain SA, a company based in France with a long history. Immediately after assuming o/ffice, conditions deteriorated, most notably with the global economic crisis caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and I was faced with a mountain of unforeseen problems and the need to address investors' concerns. From this experience, I realized firsthand the importance of the role that outside directors play in reconciling internal and external perspectives. In serving as a Toray outside director, I am therefore committed to using my unique perspective and experience to help the Company enhance its corporate value in a sustainable manner.\n\n## - What do you consider are the most important aspects of e/ffective governance?\n\nThe larger the organization, the more complex and international the business, the more important it is to integrate the organization and make decisions quickly. I believe that a well-functioning decision-making system that oversees an organization in a manner where critical decisions and issues are addressed in a timely manner is indicative of e/ffective governance. I am not referring here purely to\n\nformats and semantics. E/ffective governance is not a matter of simply completing an organization chart. It entails the smooth two-way flow of information from the frontline to management and vice versa. Given any decision-making system of organization made up of human component, outputs can often become blurred. With this in mind, I intend to look closely at this from an external perspective as an outside director.\n\nDaring to o/ffer an opinion from a slightly skewed perspective, familiarity with work in a company can often manifest itself in fixed assumptions that impede change. Moreover, while recognizing that engagement is critical to the creation of value involving various stakeholders, self-interest has the exact opposite e/ffect. I will also closely monitor this issue from a neutral standpoint.\n\n## - Why do you think diversity is important?\n\nImagine an organization where everyone thinks and acts the same way. In a world where the correct answer never changes, this scenario can be extremely e/fficient. In contrast, companies in general, including Toray, operate in a rapidly changing external environment and exist in a world of uncertainty where value disappear in an instant. The world is not a place with fixed answers. Under these circumstances, I am convinced that diversity is critical to ensuring multifaceted views and a flexible organization.\n\nDiscussions  surrounding  diversity  in  Japan  tend  to focus on the empowerment of women. It is a mistake to think that this is a solution to e/fforts aimed at promoting diversity. Putting in place a comfortable workplace for women, increasing the number of female managers, and providing women with preferential treatment are not in themselves the solution. The goal is to secure a level playing field and to allow women to demonstrate their abilities in similar fashion to men, which will lead to increased corporate value. Diversity is not only about gender or other such di/fferences. Diversity is also about individuality and a comprehensive range of factors, including the experience that each individual has gained. On the other hand, when simply bringing together a diverse group of people, should those individuals behave as they please then an ine/fficient organization that is unable to make any decisions is likely to result. Diversity in business is all about the change",

With this in mind, I believe that it makes sense to become an organization that is resilient to environmental change and highly capable of creating value.\n\n## - What are your thoughts on the use of AI in innovation and the promotion of DX?\n\nIdeas belong to each individual. Historically, people have come together to put forward new ideas. With the emergence of generative AI, which instantly organizes a huge amount of data and facts that people cannot fully examine, human beings gained an amazing bag of wisdom. Wherever possible, I have promoted the importance of becoming people who can employ AI wisely. At the same time, it is equally important that we maintain the necessary axis and materials to judge AI, and ensure that we are not controlled by it. My fear is that AI will pro/ffer plausible answers that we will grow to rely without question. The\n\napplication of AI and promotion of DX is merely the natural evolution of tools that help to further enhance convenience. It is important that we utilize these tools to create innovations and not become passive users.\n\n## - Do you have any closing words about leadership in a diverse organization?\n\nLeadership is not about a person at the top of the hierarchy wielding authority to make subordinates follow him or her. Leadership is a skill that motivates people to behave with conviction. In a diverse organization, not only management, but also a variety of people are expected to exercise leadership in various situations. I would add one more thing, the key role of a leader is to lead the team or organization into the future. Leadership does not necessarily require the leader to provide all the answers. Leadership can be achieved by letting others decide and taking responsibility. Put simply, I believe that seeing an issue to the very end is of the utmost importance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has developed the Toray Philosophy that incorporates this principle. The Group systematizes the Toray Philosophy as a Corporate Philosophy, Corporate Missions, Corporate Guiding Principles, etc. The Corporate Missions clearly enunciate that the Group will practice 'sincere and\n\ntrustworthy management.' The Corporate Guiding Principles stipulate the Group's commitment to 'acting with fairness, high ethical standards and a strong sense of responsibility while complying with laws, regulations and social norms to earn trust and meet social expectations.' When establishing the corporate governance structure, the Group seeks to realize these philosophies as its basic policy.\n\n## Outline of Governance System and Reasons for Adopting the System\n\nToray operates as a company with a Board of Corporate Auditors and Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, which includes outside directors, decides on the business execution and supervises the execution of duties by the members of the Board. The Board of Corporate Auditors includes  outside  corporate  auditors  and  independently audits the execution of duties by the members of the Board, separately from the Board of Directors and the executing organization.  This  framework  is  designed  to  secure  the transparency and fairness of decision made by the Board of Directors. In addition, there is a Governance Committee, which serves as a voluntary advisory body to the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee deliberates on all matters relating to corporate governance, enhancing the e/ffectiveness of governance by the Board of Directors.\n\nToray  Group  operates  in  a  broad  spectrum  of  business fields at a global level. Business management and\n\ndecision-making, as well as oversight, require assessment of a wide variety of risks from multiple perspectives based on expertise related to the day-to-day operations of the Group's worksites. To that end, the structure of the Board of Directors is designed to ensure that members bring a diverse range of perspectives to management oversight and  decision-making.  Meanwhile,  outside  directors  are elected to the Board to enhance transparency and fairness, to ensure management oversight from an even broader perspective, and to obtain appropriate managerial advice from a medium- to long-term perspective.\n\nThe Board of Corporate Auditors is entirely independent of the Board of Directors. Based on professional expertise in finance, accounting, and law, as well as an understanding of the Group's businesses, the Board of Corporate Auditors oversee directors' execution of their duties.\n\n## Corporate Governance Structures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strengthening the Governance Framework\n\nToray introduced an operating o/fficer system in June 2020 to enable execution based on swift decision making that accurately responds to the business environment and its\n\nchanges. Additionally, we took this opportunity to reduce the number of directors, and as of June 27, 2023, had appointed eight internal members of the Board and five",

The Board of Directors determines the scope of business execution to be delegated to vice presidents and supervises the execution of those duties.

The Governance Committee consists of two inside and five outside directors, and it is chaired by an outside director to ensure a multifaceted perspective.\n\n## Reduction in number of Members of the Board and change in its composition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Policy on the Composition of the Board of Directors, Policy and Procedures for Selecting Members of the Board\n\nThe Board of Directors has to evaluate a wide variety of risks multilaterally to fulfill its roles of oversight and decision-making. To that end, the Board of Directors strives for appropriate balance in the number of members and structure, with members who widely cover the fields of the corporate activities of the\n\nGroup in terms of knowledge, experience and ability, and appropriately ensures diversity as a whole with the announcement of the skill matrix of members of the Board.

In the light of their roles, remuneration for outside directors consists of basic remuneration only.\n\nRemuneration is set at a level that enables the Company to secure superior human resources and further motivate them  to  improve  performance,  referring  mainly  to  the results of a survey of other companies' remuneration by an external third-party organization. The Company undertakes reviews of the payment ratios of performance-based remuneration and remuneration other than performance-based remuneration as appropriate, based on the results of a survey of other companies' remuneration and deliberations at the Governance Committee.\n\nWith  respect  to  basic  remuneration,  the  maximum limit of total remuneration is determined at general meetings of stockholders.

        "page_content": "## Overview of the Results of the Analysis and Evaluation\n\nToray's Board of Directors implemented 'Questionnaire Survey to Evaluate the E/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023' of all the 17 Board members and corporate auditors. In addition, the Company had individual interviews with seven outside directors and outside corporate auditors to hear opinions in relation to the responses to the questionnaire. The collection and summary of the questionnaire and interviews were outsourced to a third-party organization to ensure transparency and objectivity. The survey results were analyzed and evaluated at the Governance Committee held on June 9, 2023, and the results of the analysis and evaluation were deliberated at the Board of Directors' meeting held on June 14, 2023. The overview of the analysis and evaluation results shown below describes the contents resolved at the Board of Directors meeting.\n\n- (1)  In FY 2022, the Board of Directors performed oversight and decision-making based on a deep understanding and sympathy with the Management Philosophy and Corporate Missions. As a result, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in indicating the direction of corporate strategies and other major courses of action in an appropriate manner.\n- (2)  In FY 2022, the Board of Directors held 15 meetings in total to perform oversight and decision-making in a timely and appropriate manner. We believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in establishing an environment conducive to appropriate risk-taking by maintaining dialogue between outside directors and vice presidents and undertaking other initiatives in the operation of the Board of Directors.\n- (3)  With respect to the 15 Board of Directors meetings held in FY 2022, the attendance rate of the members of the Board was 100%. Outside directors made remarks mainly from\n\ntheir respective professional viewpoints. Their opinions at the Board of Directors' meetings, including the abovementioned remarks, were appropriately reflected in measures taken by the management. The Board of Directors confirmed that progress has been made in determining the root cause and implementing recurrence prevention measures in relation to the inappropriate actions involving UL LLC certification in the Company's resins business. With respect to transactions causing possible conflicts of interest, internal procedures to handle them were appropriately carried out. For all of the reasons above, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in carrying out the e/ffective oversight of members of the Board and the management from an independent and objective standpoint in an appropriate manner.\n\n- (4)  In light of foregoing, we believe that the Board of Directors generally fulfilled its roles and responsibilities in an e/ffective manner in FY 2022. Regarding 'diversity at the Board of Directors meetings,' however, we will continue discussions, on the premise of ensuring quality, on the recruitment of human resources that can contribute to realizing the Toray Philosophy. With regard to 'further activating discussions at the Board of Directors meetings,' continuing from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, specific measures for improvement must be taken in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024 and thereafter so as to further improve the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors.\n- (5)  With respect to the opinions received from the members of the Board and corporate auditors while evaluating the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors, the Governance Committee shall deepen discussions based on those opinions with a view to further improving the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors, as necessary.\n\n## Measures to ensure the e/ffectiveness of the governance framework for listed subsidiaries\n\n## Chori Co., Ltd\n\n- \u00b7  On  March  25,  2020,  Chori  Co.,  Ltd.  established  the Governance Committee, which is a voluntary committee, to strengthen the independence, objectivity, and accountability of the functions performed by its Board of Directors regarding the nomination and remuneration of members of the Board. The subsidiary's Governance Committee also deliberates on matters that become necessary to be addressed from the perspective of protecting the interests of its general shareholders. No former employees, directors, o/fficers, or other personnel of the Company serve as members of the Governance Committee, which is composed mainly of independent outside directors, hence the independence of the subsidiary in exercising authority over the election and dismissal of its directors is guaranteed.\n- \u00b7  When exercising authority over the election and dismissal of the subsidiary's independent outside directors, the Company seeks to make an appropriate decision for each agenda item, while serving the interests of the subsidiary's shareholders in general. That decision depends on whether the candidate can oversee management from a broader perspective to further improve the transparency and fairness of management and can provide appropriate management advice from a mediumto long-term perspective, based on his/her sympathy to the management philosophies of Toray and the subsidiary, in addition to understanding of the businesses.\n- \u00b7  The transactions between the Company and the subsidiary are concluded based on the negotiations with reference to several factors such as the market price.\n\n## Suido Kiko Kaisha, Ltd.\n\nOn December 20, 2021, Suido Kiko Kaisha, Ltd. established the Governance Commit-tee, which is a voluntary committee. Its purpose is to appropriately manage the election and dismissal of members of the senior management (full-time executive directors), nomination of director candi-dates, remuneration of members of the senior management and directors, and conflicts of interest with the controlling shareholder, while strengthening the in-dependence, objectivity and accountability of the functions of the Board of Directors regarding decisions and other matters on important transactions and actions with the controlling shareholder for the purpose of protecting the interests of minority shareholders. By requiring a majority of the committee members to be independent outside directors, the independence of the subsidiary in exercising authority over the election and dismissal of its directors is guaranteed.\n\n- \u00b7  When exercising authority over the elec-tion and dismissal of the subsidiary's out-side and independent directors, the Company seeks to make an appropriate decision for each agenda item, while serving the interests of the subsidiary's shareholders in general. That decision depends on whether the candidate can oversee management from a broader perspective to further im-prove the transparency and fairness of management and can provide appropriate management advice from a medium- to long-term perspective, based on his/her sympathy to the management philosophies of Toray and the subsidiary in addition to understanding of the businesses.\n- \u00b7  The transactions between the Company and the subsidiary are concluded based on the negotiations with reference to several factors such as the market price.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Please let us know your thoughts regarding the inquiry process up to finalizing the new team and your assessment of that process.\n\n- A As Toray engages in such a broad range of main businesses, managing them and exercising leadership is no easy task. Led by the Governance Committee, we have long discussed and sought a person with a new management style and outstanding leadership who can realize the 'New Toray,' while carrying over the extensive experience built up over the years under President Akihiro Nikkaku. As the new president appointed through this process, I expect to see Mr. Mitsuo Ohya fuse Toray's technological capabilities with his own expertise in marketing, thereby realizing creativity and innovation amid the discontinuous changes in the business environment and driving growth in corporate value.\n- Q The Tokyo Stock Exchange requires improvements from any company that falls below a PBR of 1x. The Medium-Term Management Program, Project AP-G 2025 (AP-G 2025), includes 'improving profitability' and 'improving asset e/fficiency' as challenges, as well as 'ultimate value creation' as one of its basic strategies. Please provide some comments and recommendations for Toray on AP-G 2025.\n- A As an outside director, I feel disappointed that Toray's PBR has fallen below 1x. In addition to releasing the names of companies that have dropped below this benchmark, the Tokyo Stock Exchange also announced the 'JPX Prime 150,' made up of those companies that have created significant corporate value. Based on my analysis, the average PBR of the 150 selected companies is 3.6x. These companies clearly have earnings capability, in other words, excellent net profit-to-sales ratios. And their ROE greatly exceeds their cost of capital. In this respect, I believe both 'improving profitability' and 'improving asset e/fficiency' are appropriate program challenges under AP-G 2025. All that is left to do now is take action.\n- Q Another basic strategy under AP-G 2025 is 'enhancement of people-centric management.' Please provide us with a few comments if you have any thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of Toray regarding human resources.\n- A I feel that historically, Toray has highly valued its people, and that it has been committed to training. Nearly 30 years ago, well ahead of the rest of the industry, Toray opened the Toray Management School as a selective manager training program. Today, the number of companies that have introduced selective personnel training programs has drastically increased, and Toray was truly a pioneer in this respect. One aspect that symbolizes the Company's stance, though, is that despite struggling with its performance at times, Toray has continued to administer this program without ever suspending it or cutting its budget. So, I feel that it makes sense to include 'enhancement of people-centric management' within AP-G 2025. As society has come to recognize the importance of human capital management, however, I feel it is important for Toray to create an environment and corporate culture that enable people to grow rather than one that nurtures them, and to enhance the autonomy and independence of individuals.\n\n## Q Please tell us about your impression after having participated in the Institutional Investors Collective Engagement Forum (IICEF)'s Collective Engagement Program.\n\n- A The Collective Engagement Program was a valuable opportunity in that I was able to engage in sincere dialogue with the investors that attended. And I feel I truthfully answered their various questions to the best of my ability. I myself have engaged with many investors over the years, and feel that I understand where their interests lie. Yet I am convinced that directly conversing with investors regarding individual companies and touching upon their specific areas of interest was beneficial for strengthening the governance of Toray in the future. The participants of the program fully conveyed the message that investors are most strongly interested in the governance of the companies in which they invest, and that they wish to ascertain whether they should continue to trust and invest in these companies. I therefore intend to strive together as part of the Board of Directors in order to meet the investors' expectations.\n\n## IICEF Collective Engagement Program\n\nDate:\n\nFebruary 20, 2023\n\nAttendance: Kunio Ito, Member of the Board; Susumu Kaminaga, Member of the Board; Kazuo Futagawa, Member of the Board; and Kazuya Jono, Corporate Auditor Participating Investors:  7 companies (organized by the Institutional Investors Collective Engagement Forum)\n\n- \u00b7 Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co., Ltd.\n- \u00b7 Meiji Yasuda Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n- \u00b7 Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation\n- \u00b7 Pension Fund Association\n- \u00b7 Resona Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n- \u00b7 Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n- \u00b7 Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management Co., Ltd.\n\nWe held a collective engagement with the seven companies listed above regarding the inappropriate actions relating to UL certification by Toray's resins business. The collective engagement provided Toray an opportunity to explain the awareness held by the outside directors and outside corporate auditors, together with the Company's initiatives, regarding corporate culture and governance. At the same time, the collective engagement served as a valuable opportunity to deepen the understanding between Toray and the investors on these issues. Toray will continue to ensure accountability going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Compliance\n\n## Basic Approach\n\nIn order to contribute to society by leveraging innovative technologies and advanced materials in line with its corporate philosophy, as well as by working to resolve major global issues, Toray Group must build and maintain relationships of trust with our various stakeholders. And in order to gain this trust, it is essential to comply with the laws\n\nand regulations related to our business activities in each country in which we operate and maintain the highest level of integrity in all our actions. Therefore, top management focuses on a leadership role in placing the highest priority on compliance, while both the Group and its suppliers are required to promote ethics and compliance.\n\n## Ethics and Compliance Structure\n\nToray has established an Ethics and Compliance Committee chaired by the President and consisting of the vice presidents. At this committee, management and workers come together to consider and discuss policies related to ethics and compliance. Moreover, this Committee reports on the operational status of the whistle-blowing system established by Toray Group, including the number of reports (consultations) and other details, to members of the Board.\n\nDuring FY 2022, this Committee met twice to deliberate and discuss Toray Group's ethics and compliance activity results for FY 2021 and the activity plans and progress updates for FY 2022. We also discussed individual measures, such as the implementation of Compliance Month and collaboration on plans with safety activities. In each\n\n## Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct\n\nToray Group has established the Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct (revised in June 2023), which outlines the code of conduct as important rules to be followed by executives and employees of Toray Group, as well as the compliance helpline, and the promotion framework for ethics and compliance. The contents of the code are regularly reviewed\n\nby  the  Ethics  and  Compliance  Committee,  chaired  by the President and consisting of the vice presidents. Also, reports are made and submitted to the Board of Directors by this committee. The code of conduct is thoroughly communicated to all Toray group executives and employees including contracted, part-time, and temporary workers.\n\n## Corporate Ethics and Legal Compliance Education\n\nToray posts information on CSR and legal compliance on its corporate intranet. Toray Group circulates important information about legal and compliance matters that are highly relevant to its business in Japan and overseas. Besides, for the entire group companies, we promote active discussions in workplaces through workshops to examine these matters and study cases of corporate misconduct.\n\nSince FY 2012, Toray has provided e-learning courses on corporate ethics and legal compliance for all executives and employees, including contracted, part-time, and temporary workers. Themes in the training courses set for each fiscal year included explanations to instill Toray's code of conduct and whistle-blowing system, as well as case studies on anti-bribery, human rights and harassment.\n\nIn  FY  2022,  the  courses  focused  on  the  Ethics  &\n\nCompliance  Code  of  Conduct  and  Toray  Group's  whistle-blowing system, and 96.4% of the targeted participants took the course. In a survey of participants, 60.8% answered that they had 'understood' the content of the Code of Conduct, and 38.9% that they had 'understood the Code of Conduct to some extent,' and we are continuing to disseminate information and promote education to further instill its content. We are also using similar teaching materials to conduct training sessions at our group companies in Japan. Following the case of misconduct in UL certification registration, in FY 2022 we also conducted thorough compliance training throughout the Company, covering topics such as an introduction to the incident, an analysis of its causes, and countermeasures.\n\nworkplace, instead of top-down initiatives led by each divisional/departmental general manager, we promote such activities by shifting to middle-up-down approach. As a starting  point,  the  middle  management  at  each  workplace themselves considered and implemented the activities required in each workplace, then conveys the opinions obtained through the activities to the top management.\n\nIn initiatives for group companies around the world, Toray Group has established the A/ffiliate Companies' Compliance Meeting and the Overseas A/ffiliate Companies' Compliance Meetings under the Ethics and Compliance Committee. Through these committees, Toray Group is examining and promoting compliance activities in each company, country and region.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In FY 2022, Toray and its group companies received a total of 97 whistle-blowing (consultation) cases, of which seven resulted in disciplinary action. The facts were investigated with utmost care to protect against any risk of negative impact on the individual reporting to or consulting with the hotline. If a problem was identified, e/fforts were made to solve the problem and measures were taken in accordance with the internal rules of each company, such as company regulations. The operational status of the whistle-blowing system is reported to the Board of Directors and the Board of Corporate Auditors by the Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn  2022,  we  developed  internal  regulations  based on the Whistleblower Protection Act, which had been revised and enforced in June of the same year, and added executives, employees who have retired within one year, and business partners to the users of the whistle-blowing system. We also made our own revisions, such as adding\n\nrules regarding the designation of personnel who handle whistleblower-related tasks.\n\n## Content and Number of Whistle-Blowing (Consultation) for Toray Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Consultation on compliance issues, such as improper expense handling\n- Reporting (consultation) on harassment and other human rights issues\n- Other reporting (consultation)\n\n## Reinforcing Compliance in Product Quality Assurance\n\nToray Group is pursuing five major issues to reinforce product quality assurance compliance throughout the Group.\n\n## 1.  Reinforcement of structures related to quality assurance systems of the entire Toray Group\n\nThe Group provides guidance to Toray Industries and its group companies  globally  regarding  the  development  of  quality assurance system, and audits the e/ffectiveness of these systems and operations. Based on the formulated product quality assurance vision, the organizations design initiatives to close the gap between the vision and actual performance.\n\n## 2.  Development of human resources and creation of workplace culture not allowing any misconduct\n\nToray has designated November as Quality Month. Coinciding with this initiative, the Company has conducted quality assurance compliance education since FY 2020. By providing educational materials to Toray Industries as well as its group companies in and outside Japan, each department and company is taking the initiative in promoting training. (Number of training participants in FY 2022: 23,918)\n\n## 3.  Understanding of actual state of agreements with customers and establishment of guidelines related to product quality (assurance)\n\nBased  on  the  guidelines  for  product  quality  assurance agreements,  we  continue  to  assess  agreements  and review their provisions as necessary.\n\n## 4.  Appropriate maintenance or control and modernization or fulfillment of measuring equipment\n\nThe Group has risk assessment tables for judging the necessity  of  upgrading  or  conducting  maintenance  on measuring equipment, and use them to identify devices in need of an upgrade.\n\n## 5.  Improvement of quality data management system to not allow any misconduct\n\nThe Group is developing data management systems that minimize human involvement, such as by automating measurement and transfer of measurement data, and issuance of inspection reports.\n\n## Competition Law Compliance, Anti-Corruption, and Anti-Bribery\n\n## 1. Competition Law Compliance\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct defines the code of conduct related to competition laws that must be observed by all Toray group executives and employees. Educational materials related to competition laws have been prepared in Japanese and English for all Toray\n\ngroup employees. Within Japan, the Group prepares and utilizes compliance training materials and gathers examples of compliance violations related to competition laws. In FY 2022, no legal action was taken against Toray Group on the grounds of anti-competitive behavior, antitrust or monopoly practices.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery\n\nIn January 2020, Toray Group formulated the Anti-Bribery Regulations that explicitly prohibit o/ffering and accepting bribes to or from public o/fficials and business partners, and established the rules for approval and reporting when o/ffering or receiving money or other benefits to or from public o/fficials and business partners. Similar rules have also been introduced at both domestic and overseas group companies.\n\nThe Ethics & Compliance Code of Conduct defines the code of conduct related to anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures that must be observed by all Toray group executives and employees. Accompanying guidelines and educational  materials  covering  to  the  anti-corruption  and anti-bribery measures have been prepared in Japanese and English for all Toray group employees and they are shared on a group-wide basis. No legal action was taken against Toray Group on anti-corruption or anti-bribery grounds in FY 2022.\n\n## Protection of Personal Information\n\nIn order to comply with Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information, Toray has established Regulations for the Management of Personal Information, together with a management framework and practices to ensure each department manages personal information appropriately. Audits are regularly conducted into the management conditions in each department.\n\nIn FY 2022, the Company received no complaints concerning  personal  information  and  there  were  no  data breaches. Major Toray group companies in and outside Japan appropriately conduct management in accordance with the management systems and methods specified by the internal rules of each company.\n\n## Promotion of Mission B.E.A.R. Activities\n\nIn FY 2018, Toray Group launched a new initiative  with  the  slogan  'Have  the integrity to do the right thing in the right way.' The initiative includes the following four principles for taking more e/ffective action to ensure compliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Compliance Action Principles\n\n- B: Be fair, be honest and have integrity\n- E : Encourage respect and communication\n- A : Adopt a Genba (workplace) approach-Look to the facts!\n- R : Responsibility as a member of our excellent company\n\nUnder the name 'Mission B.E.A.R.,' an acronym of the first word of each principle, Toray group companies formulate declarations and action plans related to compliance, and implement initiatives that correspond to their individual\n\n## Implementing Internal Legal Audits\n\nIn  FY  2022,  Toray  implemented  internal  legal  compliance audits relating to high-priority items including the Antimonopoly Act, bribery regulations, insider trading regulations, and concluding agreements, for designated departments of Toray and its group companies in Japan. Nothing\n\n## Improving Security Trade Controls\n\nConcerns about the spread of conventional mass weapons of destruction and changes in the international security  balance  necessitate  risk  management  addressing security trade controls. Toray convenes a Security Trade Administration Committee comprising o/fficers of divisions that are involved in exports and technology transfer. In FY 2022, the committee decided on measures to implement\n\nfor the fiscal year after considering pressing risks based on  recent  international  circumstances  and  regulatory trends. The committee members also convene a Divisional Security Trade Administration Committee that communicates corporate measures and implements supplementary programs, such as precautions to be taken by departments and group companies under its supervision.\n\nsituations. Toray Group implements periodic follow-ups for the initiatives of each company, shares the e/ffective initiatives of each company within the Group, and encourages each company to take the initiative in evolving their compliance activities.\n\nIn FY 2022, Toray continued to assist each company's compliance promotion activities. Including the Compliance Promotion Month, steps were actively taken to share compliance-related initiatives, utilize the results of compliance awareness questionnaires, and carry out collaborative projects with safety activities at plants. Through these activities every e/ffort is being made to strengthen risk response that emphasizes factors unique to each region and type of business while reinforcing Toray Group's integrity-driven corporate culture.\n\ninappropriate was found in any of the items covered, but we will continue to raise awareness of legal compliance by sharing information through educational activities and in-house magazines.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also facilitates close communication between the Board of Directors and top management as it pursues risk management as an integral part of management strategy. In addition, as subordinate organizations of the Risk Management Committee, the Overseas Crisis Management Committee and Local Crisis Management Committee have been established to manage employees' overseas travel under normal conditions and compile information on overseas risks.\n\n## Risk Management Activities\n\nFor risk management in normal times, the Group implements a PDCA cycle to manage Toray Group Priority Risks (hereinafter referred to as Priority Risks) and Specified Risks.  In  principle,  the  Company  conducts  an  exhaustive identification of Priority Risks once every three years. Priority Risks are set based on those with a high degree of potential risk (probability of occurrence \u00d7 degree of impact), and the division or department responsible for mitigating each risk focuses on risk mitigation. Specified risks\n\ninclude risks arising in a short period of time, and have a complementary relationship with priority risks. Specified Risks are determined by a dedicated department in the Corporate Strategic Planning Division that routinely monitors domestic and overseas trends, based on consultation with top management. In the event of a crisis, a quick response system is established according to the level of the crisis, in accordance with internal regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Risks\n\nMajor risks that Toray Group has evaluated to have significant impact on business, etc. are listed below. For details on each risk, please refer to 'Business and Other Risks' in the Annual Securities Report (142nd Period).\n\n- \u00b7  Crisis response risks based on the possibility of war [*Priority Risks]\n- \u00b7 Product supply disruption risk [*Priority Risks]\n- \u00b7  Risks related to product demand, market trends, and business plans\n- \u00b7 Risks related to global business development\n- \u00b7  Risks related to foreign currency, interest rate and securities market fluctuations\n- \u00b7  Risks related to environmental issues such as climate change, water shortages, and resource depletion\n- \u00b7 Risks related to natural disasters and accidents\n- \u00b7 Risks related to human resource strategies\n- \u00b7 Risk related to compliance\n- \u00b7 Risks related to information security and cyber threats\n- * 'Crisis response risks based on the possibility of war' and 'Product supply disruption risk' were set as Priority Risks for the sixth three-year period (FY 2023 to 2025) through identifying and evaluating risks, which is described on the following page.\n\n## Risk Management Committee System\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Major initiatives in FY 2022\n\n## 1. Identifying and evaluating risks\n\nIn 2022, we conducted the following process to identify and evaluate risks for the entire Group that could hinder the achievement of the targets of the Medium-Term Management Program from FY 2023 to 2025.\n\n- (1)  A survey was conducted to identify the imminence of risks as well as specific concerns in Toray Group's functional departments and domestic and overseas a/ffiliates, targeting 118 risks (see chart below) comprehensively organized  in  the  categories  of  'business  environment,' 'disasters,' 'operations,' 'E (environment),' 'S\n\n(society),' and 'G (governance)' surrounding the Group.\n\n- (2)  After aggregating and analyzing information obtained from the survey, discussions on risk awareness, issues, and  countermeasures  were  held  with  risk-related departments and top management.\n- (3)  Summarizing the analysis of the questionnaire survey and information obtained from the discussions, draft of Priority Risk is deliberated and decided by the Risk Management Committee. Each division also sets its own risks to be addressed.\n\n## Identifying Risks for Achievement of the Targets of the Medium-Term Management Programs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Priority risk mitigation activities\n\n## (1)  Addressing Information Security Risks\n\nInformation  security  has  been  included  as  one  risk area in the fifth three-year set of Priority Risks for Toray Group,  and  more  comprehensive  initiatives  have  been taken group-wide. In FY 2022, the Group established the Toray  Group  Information  Security  Steering  Committee, which is chaired by the head of Toray Industries' General Administration & Communications Division, and changed the system from individual optimization of each company to the entire Group. Under the supervision and management of the committee, Toray Group as a whole maintains and improves information security by formulating groupwide security management standards, following up on the implementation status, and conducting periodic security assessment and monitoring. In the event of incidents such as information leaks or suspension of information system use due to cyber-attacks, we ensure that such incidents are reported to the head of the General Administration & Communications Division within 24 hours. Then, depending on the damage or the possibility of damage, a system and response procedures are in place and operated to contact relevant parties inside and outside the Company and to prevent the spread of damage.\n\n## (2) Addressing Global CSR procurement risks\n\nToray  Group  has  designated  'Global  CSR  procurement risks' as one type of risk under the fifth set of Priority Risks, and has considered the adoption of a process that involves identifying important CSR procurement risk types corresponding to specific countries, regions, and industries, and then picking out suppliers that require risk investigation, auditing, and/or mitigation measure implementation. In FY\n\n2022, we carried out testing in cooperation with Japanese and overseas Group companies to verify whether the survey sheets and audit procedures for suppliers, which were created with the three priority issues of human rights and labor, safety and health, and environmental preservation as survey targets, are actually operational. We have also established a process to narrow down the list of suppliers to be surveyed based on supplier information collected from each of our domestic and overseas Group companies. In the future, we will strive to reduce CSR procurement risks for the entire Group by establishing processes for risk identification and investigation, conducting risk investigations of identified suppliers to be surveyed, and conducting audits and follow-ups when risks are identified.\n\n## 3. Business Continuity Plan Initiatives\n\nIn FY 2018, Toray Industries, Inc. created and began administering BCPs for key products selected from each business in accordance with the Procedures for Developing BCPs for Designated Key Products in the event of an earthquake. Group companies in and outside Japan began this initiative in FY 2019. In addition, since FY 2012, Toray Group has continued to conduct company-wide drills on setting up an emergency response headquarters. In FY 2022, as in FY 2021, in light of Toray's enhanced network environment and the improved reliability of public network infrastructure, the Company conducted initial response drills online, on the assumption that a large number of employees could be working from home due to the suspension of transportation services and the outbreak of COVID-19. Toray Group will continue to strengthen its capability to respond to earthquakes with training and other measures.\n\n91",

Industrial applications witnessed a demand recovery trend for automobile applications in some regions. Almost all applications and regions were a/ffected by the soaring costs of raw materials and fuels as well as persistently high transportation costs.\n\nThe Performance Chemicals segment overall was a/ffected by the soaring raw material and fuel prices.\n\nIn the resins and chemicals businesses, while the fine chemicals business performed strongly, the resins business was weak given the impact of demand declines in the Japanese and Chinese markets and other factors. Demand declined due to inventory adjustment in supply chains for optical applications and electronic parts in the films business as well as OLED-related materials and circuit materials in the electronic & information materials business.\n\nIn aerospace applications, production rate of aircrafts at the major customer showed a recovery trend.\n\nSports applications grew strongly, due mainly to bicycles for outdoor leisure, fishing rods, and golf applications.\n\nIn industrial applications, demand for environment- and energy-related applications, including compressed natural gas tank applications, remained strong due to rising oil prices.\n\nWe promoted passing on the rise in raw material and fuel prices to the sales price.\n\nIn the water treatment business, demand for reverse osmosis membranes and other products grew strongly, while facilities that newly started operations contributed to the performance.\n\nAmong Japanese subsidiaries in the segment, an engineering subsidiary saw increases in the shipment of lithium-ion secondary battery-related equipment.\n\nIn the pharmaceutical business, while sales volume of orally active prostacyclin derivative DORNER\u2122 expanded for the overseas markets, sales of pruritus treatment REMITCH\u00ae* were a/ffected by the introduction of its generic versions as well as by a NHI drug price revision.\n\nIn the medical devices business, shipment of dialyzers for hemodiafiltration grew strongly in Japan, but the business was a/ffected by the soaring prices of raw materials and fuels.\n\n*REMITCH\u00ae is a registered trademark of Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.",

The Company will increase annual production capacity from 10 million m 2 to 15 million m 2 . The new production lines are scheduled to start operation in the second half of 2024 with total capital investment of approximately \u00a510 billion.\n\nUltrasuede\u2122  is  a  highly  sensitive,  high-performance  suede  texture  artificial leather sold globally as a leading edge Japan-quality brand. Increasing production capacity roughly 1.6-fold in 2019, production has continued at full-capacity. In addition to fashion and home interior items, applications of this product have expanded in recent years including automobile interiors. In particular, electric vehicle interior applications have expanded as a substitute for natural leather from the perspective of environmental friendliness. Moreover, given its good a/ffinity with increasingly simple and excellent design of interiors, applications are expanding from conventional seat material to materials for ceilings, door trim, instrument panels, and other areas. Accordingly, demand for this product is dramatically growing.\n\n## Examples\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLexus RZ\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNio EC6\n\nLOVOT",

Specifically, the Group will retrofit the production facilities at Gifu Plant to increase production capacity 1.6-fold compared with today. At a total capital investment of \u00a58 billion, the new facilities are scheduled to begin production in 2025.\n\nLumirror\u2122 is an extremely smooth film that is highly e/ffective in enabling thin, irregularity-free ceramic layers. Many MLCC manufacturers have adopted it for this reason, helping them to miniaturize and raise the capacity of MLCCs. Toray leads the global MLCC mold release film market, currently producing these films in Japan (Mishima and Gifu Plants), Malaysia, and Korea. The new production line is expected to address recycling by collecting used film for reuse.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLumirror\u2122  is  a  biaxially  oriented polyester film, first produced on an industrial scale in Japan by Toray. It is used worldwide in a variety of applications ranging from electronics to packaging, magnetic and industrial specialties.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This technology enables highspeed assembly of thermosetting CFRP parts as well as of thermosetting and thermoplastic CFRP parts without the need for adhesive bonding and bolt fastening.\n\nThermosetting CFRP has been used for airframes made of CFRP because of its high reliability based on a long track record of use. The downside, however, is that the complicated CFRP adhesive bonding and bolt fastening processes have become assembly bottlenecks. In terms of production time, CFRP airframes have therefore lagged behind those of aluminum alloy airframes. The Group will push ahead with demonstrations of this technology with a view to commercializing its use in airframes after 2030, along with further expanding CFRP applications.\n\nThermally Welded Assembly of Aircraft Structural Demonstrator Applying this Technology\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following commissioning during the second half of fiscal 2022, this plant became the world's largest RO desalination facility, with a daily capacity of 909,000 cubic meters of water.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates began considering construction launch using the RO method nearly 20 years ago. Key factors in Toray obtaining this order were that its RO membrane technology and robust track record in the Middle East over the past 15 years have delivered lower capital investment and operating costs than the conventional evaporation method. The country has plans to build other RO plants in the future, and Toray will continue to contribute to its infrastructure development by providing RO membranes and technical support.\n\nToray  Membrane  Middle East  LLC  (TMME)  will  provide  technical  services.  By strengthening RO membrane supply and technical support, Toray Group will help alleviate  water  shortages  in  the Middle East as a region that supports stable energy supply of the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is the first kit approved in Japan to measure two apolipoprotein A2 (APOA2) isoform concentrations in plasma. Toray will begin o/ffering Toray APOA2-iTQ domestically once insurance coverage becomes available for it.\n\nProfessor Kazufumi Honda of the Graduate School of Medicine of Nippon Medical School discovered that the quantitative ratios of APOA2-AT and APOA2-TQ change in the blood of pancreatic cancer patients. Based on the results of joint research with Nippon Medical School and the National Cancer Center, as well as research conducted by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, Toray has obtained unique antibodies that specifically recognize the terminal structures of the two APOA2 isoforms and developed Toray APOA2-iTQ by using the antibodies which can precisely measure the concentrations of these isoforms.\n\nAlthough survival rates are expected to improve if pancreatic cancer can be detected at an early stage, this type of cancer progresses more rapidly than others and has symptoms that do not readily become apparent to those su/ffering from it. As the new kit is blood-based, Toray APOA2-iTQ enables testing of more people than other approaches. Moreover, the reagent measures substances that di/ffer from existing tumor markers and is therefore expected to detect pancreatic cancer which is not detectable by those markers.",

The Group is communicating proactively with various stakeholders in all aspects of its corporate activities, and periodically report on and discuss the content of these activities with its management. With the goal of strengthening the system for engaging with stakeholders, a new organization was established in April 2018 to supervise communications in general, and e/fforts are being made on centralizing the function of information transmission, both internally and externally.\n\n## Engaging with Stockholders and Investors\n\nThe  Group  actively  communicates  with  institutional investors  and  securities  company  analysts  by  providing information materials when requested and holding same-day results briefings when quarterly earnings are announced. In addition to IR materials, including integrated annual reports, the Group also provides a wide range of information on management policies and strategies, as well as financial and earnings information in the Investor Relations section of the Toray website.\n\nBriefings on business for stockholders are held in order to deepen their understanding of Toray Group.\n\nIn FY 2022, Toray held four results briefings and held 565 meetings with investors and analysts.\n\n## Engaging with Customers\n\nToray  Group  believes  that  the  customer  comes  first. Communication is carried out closely with the customers,  mainly  through  the  marketing  and  sales  departments, and periodic customer satisfaction surveys. The results of these surveys are shared internally at Board meetings and through in-house newsletters as the Group strives to provide even higher quality customer service.\n\nTo  serve  as  spaces  for  communication  with  customers, we have established showrooms at our main locations, including Mishima (inside the Toray Human Resources Development Center) and Shiga (within the Shiga Plant). In FY 2022, we renovated the exhibition space on the corporate culture floor of the Toray Human Resources Development Center (Mishima).\n\n## Engaging with Business Partners\n\nWhile providing materials and products as a manufacturer of advanced materials, Toray Group must engage in upstream management of its supply chains to better fulfill the needs of its customers, including the areas of production facilities and procured raw materials and resources.  Accordingly,  the  Group  has  established  its Basic Purchasing Policies and Basic Distribution Policies to emphasize this approach and ensure fair business activities. Throughout the Group, proper and fair transactions, adherence to laws, environmental preservation, respect for human rights, improvements in quality and other policies in initiatives with regard to corporate responsibility in procurement, purchasing, and distribution are promoted.\n\n## Engaging with Employees\n\nContinuous  dissemination  activities  are  necessary  to increase empathy for the Toray Philosophy and for each and every employee to act and make decisions based on the Toray Philosophy. We have thus been devising methods, such as expanding our information tools and holding regular events, in working to increase employee participation. As one of our new activities, we have been conducting live video streaming called 'REAL TALK-Everyone's Voice' since January 2023 as a forum for open, two-way communication between management and employees. Held twice at Toray's headquarters in FY 2022, the plan is to hold this type of event six times in total, including at plants, in FY 2023.\n\n## Engaging with the Mass Media\n\nToray recognizes that public relations and corporate communication activities have a role in fulfilling responsibilities for information disclosure as well as influencing public opinion. Accordingly, Toray's Corporate Communications Department actively engages with a wide range of media organizations, acting as the public's point of contact with the Company.\n\nBased on Toray's Information Disclosure Principles, the department provides fair and impartial information, even if it may cast the Company in a bad light, in a timely and appropriate manner. In FY 2022, the Company issued 171 press releases and responded to 182 media requests for information.\n\n## Engaging with Local Communities\n\nIn addition to holding informal gatherings for discussion regularly, Toray Group strives to engage in more active dialogue with nearby residents in a variety of other settings, including by participating in events sponsored by local governments and inviting local residents onto plant grounds for summer festivals.\n\nIn FY 2022, the impact from COVID-19 infections subsided, and we actively engaged in activities that contributed to local communities.",
