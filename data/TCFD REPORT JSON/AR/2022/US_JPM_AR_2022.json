Almost all nations felt the e/ffects of global economic uncertainty, including higher energy and food prices, mounting inflation rates and volatile markets, and, of course, COVID-19's lingering impacts. While all these experiences and associated turmoil have serious ramifications on our company, colleagues, clients and the countries in which we do business, their consequences on the world at large - with the extreme su/ffering of the Ukrainian people and the potential restructuring of the global order - are far more important.\n\nAs these events unfold, America remains divided within its borders, and its global leadership role is being challenged outside of its borders. Nevertheless, this is the moment when we should put aside our di/fferences and work with other Western nations to come together in defense of democracy and essential\n\nJamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer",

This is that moment again, when our country needs to work across public and private sectors to lead while improving American competitiveness - which also means re-establishing the American promise of providing equal access to opportunity for all. JPMorgan Chase, a company that historically has worked across borders and boundaries, will do its part to ensure the global economy is safe and secure.\n\nIn spite of the unsettling landscape, 2022 was somewhat surprisingly another strong year for JPMorgan Chase, with the firm generating record revenue for the fifth year in a row, as well as setting numerous records in each of our lines of business. We earned revenue in 2022 of $132.3 billion 1 and net income of $37.7 billion, with return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 18%, reflecting strong underlying performance across our businesses. We also maintained our quarterly common dividend of $1.00 per share and continued to reinforce our fortress balance sheet. We grew market share in several of our businesses and continued to make significant investments in products, people and technology while exercising strict credit discipline. In total, we extended credit and raised capital of $2.4 trillion for our consumer and institutional clients around the world.\n\nI remain proud of our company's resiliency and of what our hundreds of thousands of employees around the world have achieved, collectively and individually. Throughout these challenging past few years, we never stopped doing all the things we should be doing to serve our clients and our communities.\n\nAdhering to our basic principles and strategies (see sidebar on Steadfast Principles on page 5) allows us to drive good organic growth and properly manage our capital (including dividends and stock buybacks), as we have",

        "page_content": "## STEADFAST PRINCIPLES WORTH REPEATING\n\nLooking back on the past two+ decades starting from my time as CEO of Bank One in 2000 - there is one common theme: our unwavering dedication to help clients, communities and countries throughout the world. It is clear that our financial discipline, constant investment in innovation and ongoing development of our people are what enabled us to achieve this consistency and commitment. In addition, across the firm, we uphold certain steadfast tenets that are worth repeating.\n\nFirst, our work has very real human impact. While JPMorgan Chase stock is owned by large institutions, pension plans, mutual funds and directly by single investors, in almost all cases the ultimate beneficiaries are individuals in our communities. More than 100 million people in the United States own stock; many, in one way or another, own JPMorgan Chase stock. Frequently, these shareholders are veterans, teachers, police o/fficers, firefighters, healthcare workers, retirees or those saving for a home, education or retirement. Often, our employees also bank these shareholders, as well as their families and their companies. Your management team goes to work every day recognizing the enormous responsibility that we have to all of our shareholders.\n\nSecond, shareholder value can be built only if you maintain a healthy and vibrant company, which means doing a good job of taking care of your customers, employees and communities. Conversely, how can you have a healthy company if you neglect any of these stakeholders? As we have learned over the past few years, there are myriad ways an institution can demonstrate its compassion for its employees and its communities while still upholding shareholder value.\n\nThird, while we don't run the company worrying about the stock price in the short run, in the long run we consider our stock price a measure of our progress over time. This progress is a function of continual investments in our people, systems and products, in good and bad times, to build our capabilities. These important investments will also drive our company's future prospects and position it to grow and prosper for decades. Measured by stock performance, our progress is exceptional. For example, whether looking back 10 years or even farther to 2004, when the JPMorgan Chase/Bank One merger took place, we have significantly outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Standard & Poor's Financials Index.\n\nFourth, we are united behind basic principles and strategies (you can see the How We Do Business principles on our website) that have helped build this company and made it thrive - from maintaining a fortress balance sheet, constantly investing and nurturing talent to fully satisfying regulators, continually improving risk, governance and controls, and serving customers and clients while lifting up communities worldwide. This philosophy is embedded in our company culture and influences nearly every role in the firm.\n\nFifth, we strive to build enduring businesses, which rely on and benefit from one another, but we are not a conglomerate. This structure helps generate our superior returns. Nonetheless, despite our best e/fforts, the walls that protect this company are not particularly high and we face extraordinary competition. I have written about this reality extensively in the past and cover it again in\n\nthis letter. We recognize our strengths and vulnerabilities, and we play our hand as best we can.\n\nSixth, we operate with a very important silent partner - the U.S. government noting as my friend Warren Bu/ffett points out that his company's success is predicated upon the extraordinary conditions our country creates. He is right to say to his shareholders that when they see the American flag, they all should say thank you. We should, too. JPMorgan Chase is a healthy and thriving company, and we always want to give back and pay our fair share. We do pay our fair share - and we want it to be spent well and have the greatest impact. To give you an idea of where our taxes and fees go: In the last 10 years, we paid more than $43 billion in federal, state and local taxes in the United States and almost $19 billion in taxes outside of the United States. We also paid the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over $10 billion so that it has the resources to cover failure in the American banking sector. Our partner - the federal government - also imposes significant regulations upon us, and it is imperative that we meet all legal and regulatory requirements imposed on our company.\n\nSeventh and finally, we know the foundation of our success rests with our people. They are the frontline, both individually and as teams, serving our customers and communities, building the technology, making the strategic decisions, managing the risks, determining our investments and driving innovation. However you view the world - its complexity, risks and opportunities - a company's prosperity requires a great team of people with guts, brains, integrity, enormous capabilities and high standards of professional excellence to ensure its ongoing success.",

This was particularly true for the COVID-19 years when, during the first six months of the pandemic, we built approximately $16 billion in reserves. Then in the next six quarters, we released essentially the equivalent number. We did so only because the scenarios used to estimate future credit losses changed dramatically.\n\nThe table above shows reported net income, with and without loan loss reserve changes. Throughout this period, the credit portfolio was healthy, and charge-o/ffs remained below pre-pandemic levels. Either way, the company had strong absolute and relative performance.",

To that end, it is imperative that we run a healthy, vibrant and responsible company. In addition to traditional banking, we do a lot to help the communities in which we operate, which, in turn, provides the foundation for increased opportunity and prosperity for all. And just to note, while we are proud of the good things we do every day, we are also an organization that acknowledges the mistakes we make along the way, which is important to do. And when we do make mistakes, we own up to them, learn from them and then move on.\n\n## UNITED BY PRINCIPLES AND PURPOSE\n\nWe've always had - and published - principles to guide how we do business, with values embedded within them, which I described in the preceding section. These tenets unite our company across the globe. To complement these guidelines, we recently developed a clearly stated purpose Make dreams possible for everyone, everywhere, every day - to knit together our values with our everyday business principles and explain how we have done business for years.\n\nWhile our company has a rich history, is proud of the critical role it plays in powering economic growth and has done exceptionally well over the past 200 years, research has shown that purpose-driven companies achieve stronger business\n\nresults and have greater impact by doing better for their customers, employees and shareholders. Our intention in documenting our purpose for ourselves is to help energize our employees, di/fferentiate our company from our competitors, and push our organization to innovate on behalf of our clients, colleagues and communities. In addition, we are launching a new e/ffort - internally and externally - to showcase how the work we do matters and has tangible impact locally and around the world.\n\nIn detailing the elements of our purpose, shown in the following sidebar, we have tried to make every word meaningful.",

        "page_content": "We are also dedicated to corporate responsibility, and our e/fforts extend far beyond significant philanthropic contributions (which total more than $350 million a year globally). For example, at the local level, we support educational institutions and work-skills training programs around the world, as well as finance a/ffordable housing and small businesses. In addition, we help formulate broadbased policies that are good for countries on issues such as healthcare, infrastructure, education and employment. Sometimes we promote specific initiatives; for example, programs that help individuals with a criminal background get a sec-\n\nond chance. Lest anyone think that I've become a little soft, rest assured your CEO is a red-blooded, patriotic, free-enterprise and free-market capitalist (properly regulated, of course) and finds nothing inconsistent with the multifaceted ways we use our capabilities to lift up our communities.\n\nPart of our corporate responsibility e/fforts are focused on progress toward diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), which is detailed in the sidebar below. And the sidebar on pages 18 and 19 shows how our work on the ground translates to a particular geography, in this case the state of Ohio.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTING OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION EFFORTS\n\nWe seek to create a company that reflects the diverse communities that we serve, a workplace in which all employees feel they belong and are respected. We believe these e/fforts not only make us a positive work environment, but they also make our company stronger, our business more profitable and our institution a better global corporate citizen. This objective is integrated into how we do business every day. Some of our recent progress is highlighted below:\n\n- \u00b7  We continue to identify ways to support our military veterans. In 2011, along with 10 other companies, JPMorgan Chase co-founded the Veteran Jobs Mission (VJM), a coalition committed to hiring at least 100,000 veterans by 2020. Since its founding, more than 300 member companies representing various industries across the United States have reported over 880,000 veteran hires . In 2022, VJM increased its goal to 2 million veteran hires and 200,000 military spouse hires over the next decade. JPMorgan Chase alone has hired over 18,000 veterans since 2011 and currently employs approximately 3,000 military spouses .\n- \u00b7  We continue to make strides in developing a diversified workplace. By year-end, women represented 49% of the firm's total workforce. Overall, Hispanic, Asian and Black representation\n\ngrew to 21%, 18% and 14%, respectively. In 2022, the number of employees who self-identified as LGBTQ+ increased by 35% year-over-year, following 50% year-over-year growth in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7  The firm's O/ffice of Disability Inclusion (ODI) continues to lead strategy and initiatives aimed at advancing careers while helping the firm be a bank of choice for people with disabilities. As ODI kicked o/ff its business growth and entrepreneurship work in 2022, it provided business coaching to over 225 entrepreneurs with disabilities and commissioned research with the National Disability Institute, which identified unique opportunities and challenges among small business owners who have a disability.\n\n## An update on our $30 billion racial equity commitment\n\nWhat began in 2020 as a $30 billion, five-year commitment is now transforming into a consistent business practice that our lines of business deliver each day to support Black, Hispanic, Latino and other underserved communities.\n\nBy the end of 2022, we reported nearly $29 billion in progress toward our original goal . But our focus is not on how much money is deployed it is on long-term impact and outcomes.",

        "page_content": "Here are some details on our program's progress through 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Supplier diversity. In 2022, our firm spent approximately $2.1 billion directly with diverse suppliers - an increase of 25% over 2021. As a part of our racial equity commitment, $400 million was spent in 2022 with over 200 Black-, Hispanic- and Latino-owned businesses - more than doubling the amount spent in 2021.\n- \u00b7 A/ffordable rental housing. Through our A/ffordable Housing Preservation program, we approved funding of approximately $18 billion in loans to incentivize the preservation of nearly 170,000 a/ffordable housing rental units across the United States. Additionally, we financed approximately $4 billion for the construction and rehabilitation of a/ffordable rental housing.\n- \u00b7 Homeownership . In a rising rate environment, we continue our e/fforts to provide homeownership opportunities for Black, Hispanic and Latino households across all income levels, including advocating for policies that reduce barriers to owning a home. The biggest barriers are upfront cash for a down payment and closing costs. In 2022, we expanded our $5,000 Chase Homebuyer Grant program to include over 11,000 majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities. Since our grant program began in 2021, we have provided about 2,700 grants totaling $13.5 million. We have also assisted Black, Hispanic and Latino homeowners with 11,500 incremental home loans together worth over $4 billion, mainly driven by refinance activity when rates were low.\n- \u00b7 Small business. In 2022, we launched a Special Purpose Credit Program, the first of its kind nationally, to expand credit access for small businesses in majority Black, Hispanic and Latino communities, which have traditionally been underserved. When I visited Houston last year, I met Sherice and Steve Garner, Chase customers who own a local barbecue business, Southern Q. They are examples of the types of customers we want to support. Previously, they had been using their personal bank account to run their business. We helped them secure a small business loan to purchase their business location. To assist more families like the Garners, we hired\n- 45 local senior business consultants to provide one-on-one coaching and host educational events, community workshops and business training seminars to support minority entrepreneurs across 21 U.S. cities.\n- \u00b7 Minority depository institutions (MDI) and community development financial institutions (CDFI) . We invested more than $100 million in equity in diverse financial institutions and provided over $200 million in incremental financing to CDFIs to support communities that lack access to traditional financing. We also helped them build their capacity so they can provide a greater number of critical services like mortgages and small business loans. Additionally, we do not charge a fee for nearly all our participating MDI and CDFI customers who make a withdrawal at a Chase ATM.\n- \u00b7 Access to banking . We helped more than 400,000 customers open low-cost checking accounts; we've also opened 13 Community Center branches (a total of 15 Community Center branches since 2019), often in areas with larger Black, Hispanic and Latino populations; and we hired over 140 Community Managers in underserved communities to build relationships with community leaders, nonprofits and small businesses. These Community Center branches are unique spaces in the heart of urban communities with more space than standard bank branches to host local events, small business mentoring sessions and financial health seminars. The majority were built with minority contractors from the community; we hire sta/ff locally and we engage local artists to help ensure these locations complement their neighborhood. We have been pleased by the dramatic positive e/ffect these specialized branches have had on their communities to date and expect to expand the program.\n\nBy driving inclusive economic growth, we can help create a brighter future for all, no matter where people live or the circumstances they're born into. We provide regular updates on our corporate website about our progress toward equity and equality, and I encourage you to read about the meaningful impact we're making within our firm and with the people we serve.",

We lend to small, midsized and big businesses; we hire, pay well and provide great benefits; and we finance hospitals, schools, grocery stores, homes, automobiles and governments. For more than 200 years, this approach has enabled us to make investments that have a lasting impact on local economies, families and neighborhoods while also supporting them in good and challenging times.\n\nWe have been in Ohio since 1812, and our experience there serves as a great example of how our resources drive growth on the ground.\n\n## Our support to government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit organizations:\n\n- \u00b7  We serve approximately 150 government, higher education, healthcare and nonprofit clients throughout the state, and over the last five years, we provided nearly $9 billion in credit and capital to them.\n- \u00b7  Our clients range from University Hospitals Health System, Inc. to the Ronald McDonald House in Columbus and the University of Dayton in Dayton.\n- \u00b7  We are the primary treasury bank for Ohio State University and the primary bank for the city of Columbus; we also bank nearly 50 counties, cities and school districts across the state.\n\n## Our support to investment and middle market banking clients:\n\n- \u00b7  Our support includes $120 billion in credit and capital over the last five years for Commercial & Industrial clients such as energy, retail and auto businesses.\n- \u00b7  We have over 4,800 large and midsized clients in Ohio, up over 70% compared with 2019, which also includes emerging middle market companies owned by veterans, women, LGBTQ+ individuals and people of color. This gives us leading market shares in the state compared with other banks.\n\n## Our support to local financial firms:\n\n- \u00b7  We have provided nearly $20 billion in credit and capital over the last five years for financial institutions such as local banks, insurance companies, asset managers and securities firms.\n- \u00b7  Importantly, we bank 19 of Ohio's regional, midsized and community banks, helping them serve local communities and accomplish their other goals.\n\n## Our support to small businesses:\n\n- \u00b7  By the end of 2022, loan balances for small business customers in Ohio totaled over $800 million - funds being used to run and grow companies and create jobs.\n- - Includes support for distribution of the federal government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to help small businesses navigate the pandemic in 2020 and 2021\n- \u00b7  In 2022 alone, JPMorgan Chase helped over 160,000 small businesses thrive and grow through access to customers, capital and networks, giving us the second largest business banking market share in the state. We also o/ffered some 106,000 hours of advice and support to small businesses.\n\n## Our support to consumer banking needs:\n\n- \u00b7  We operate nearly 225 branches and over 530 ATMs across the state.\n- \u00b7  To help Ohioans build wealth and be financially healthy, we have provided more than 4 million savings, checking and credit card accounts, enabling these consumers to gain access to resources such as free financial health services, as well as mortgage and auto loans.\n- - Ranked as the second largest provider of consumer banking in Ohio with over 2 million checking and savings accounts and customer deposits totaling nearly $37 billion in 2022\n- \u00b7  In 2022, we oversaw more than $20 billion in investment and annuity assets for clients.",

At the same time, the ongoing war in Ukraine is roiling trade relations across Europe and Asia and redefining the way countries and companies plan for energy security. The need to provide energy a/ffordably and reliably for today, as well as make the necessary investments to decarbonize for tomorrow, underscores the inextricable links between economic growth, energy security and climate change. We need to do more, and we need to do so immediately.\n\nTo expedite progress, governments, businesses and non-governmental organizations need to align across a series of practical policy changes that comprehensively address fundamental issues that are holding us back. Massive global investment in clean energy technologies must be done and must continue to grow year-over-year.\n\nAt the same time, permitting reforms are desperately needed to allow investment to be done in any kind of timely way. We may even need to evoke eminent domain - we simply are not getting the adequate investments fast enough for grid, solar, wind and pipeline initiatives. Policies like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that hold the potential to unlock over $1 trillion in clean technology development - need to be implemented e/ffectively . The upside is undeniable: Widespread investing across the private sector will aid domestic manufacturing, invigorate research and development in green innovation, help create resilient supply chains, lift up local economies and build the U.S. clean energy workforce by up to 9 million jobs over the next decade. While major advances have been made in the last few years on technology to help this cause, we are hopeful that the great American innovation machine (most advancements\n\nwill ultimately come from the huge capabilities and capital of America's largest companies) will find the additional technologies that are desperately needed. There is a downside - massive, ine/fficient and malinvestment of capital. I talk more about this in the last section on public policy.\n\nPolarization, paralysis and basic lack of analysis cannot keep us from addressing one of the most complex challenges of our time. Diverse stakeholders need to come together, seeking the best answers through engagement around our common interest. Bolstering growth must go hand in hand with both securing an energy future and meeting science-based climate targets for future generations.\n\n## AI, DATA AND OUR JOURNEY TO THE CLOUD\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an extraordinary and groundbreaking technology. AI and the raw material that feeds it, data, will be critical to our company's future success - the importance of implementing new technologies simply cannot be overstated. We already have more than 300 AI use cases in production today for risk, prospecting, marketing, customer experience and fraud prevention, and AI runs throughout our payments processing and money movement systems across the globe. AI has already added significant value to our company. For example, in the last few years, AI has helped us to significantly decrease risk in our retail business (by reducing fraud and illicit activity) and improve trading optimization and portfolio construction (by providing optimal execution strategies, automating forecasting and analytics, and improving client intelligence).\n\nWe currently have over 1,000 people involved in data management, more than 900 data scientists (AI and machine learning (ML) experts who create new models) and 600 ML engineers (who write the code to put models in production).

We're imagining new ways to augment and empower employees with AI through human-centered collaborative tools and workflow, leveraging tools like large language models, including ChatGPT.\n\nWe also have a 200-person, top-notch AI research group looking at the hardest problems and new frontiers in finance. We were recently ranked #1 on the Evident AI Index, the first public benchmark of major banks on their AI maturity. We take the responsible use of AI very seriously and have an interdisciplinary team of ethicists helping us prevent unintended misuse, anticipate regulation, and promote trust with our clients, customers and communities. AI and data use is complex; it must be done following the laws of the land. But it is an absolute necessity that we do it both for the benefits I just described and, equally, for the protection of the company and the financial system - because you can be certain that the bad guys will be using it, too.\n\nAll of our technology groups firmwide work together in a flywheel of innovation and deliver state-of-the-art improvements. We are proud that our AI teams have contributed top-quality novel research and compelling solutions that are transforming more and more business cases every day.\n\nAI is inextricably linked with cloud-based systems, whether public or private, and digital capabilities. Our company needs the cloud for its on-demand compute capacity, flexibility, extensibility and speed. Native cloud-based approaches will ultimately be faster, cheaper and aligned with the newest AI techniques, and they will give us easy access to constantly evolving developer tools.\n\nWe have spent over $2 billion building new, cloudbased data centers and are working to modernize a significant portion of our applications (and their related databases) to run in both our public and private cloud environments. To date, we have migrated approximately 38% of our applications to the cloud, meaning over 50% of our application portfolio (this includes third-party, cloud-based applications) is running on modern environments.\n\nThis journey to the cloud is hard work but necessary. Unlocking the full potential of the cloud and nearly 550 petabytes of data will require replatforming (putting data in a cloud-eligible format) and refactoring (i.e., rewriting) approximately 4,000 applications. This e/ffort will involve not just the 57,000 employees we have in technology but the dedicated time of firmwide management teams to help in the process.\n\n## BANKING TURMOIL AND REGULATORY GOALS\n\nThe recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the United States and Credit Suisse in Europe, and the related stress in the banking system, underscore that simply satisfying regulatory requirements is not su/fficient. Risks are abundant, and managing those risks requires constant and vigilant scrutiny as the world evolves. Regarding the current disruption in the U.S. banking system, most of the risks were hiding in plain sight . Interest rate exposure, the fair value of held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolios and the amount of SVB's uninsured deposits were always known - both to regulators and the marketplace. The unknown risk was that SVB's over 35,000 corporate clients - and activity within them - were controlled by a small number of venture capital companies that moved their deposits in lockstep.\n\nIt is unlikely that any recent change in regulatory requirements would have made a di/fference in what followed. Instead, the recent rapid rise of interest rates placed heightened focus on the potential for rapid deterioration of the fair value of HTM portfolios and, in this case, the lack of stickiness of certain uninsured deposits. Ironically, banks were incented to own very safe government securities because they were considered highly liquid by regulators and carried very low capital requirements. Even worse, the stress testing based on the scenario devised by the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) never incorporated interest rates at higher levels. This is not to absolve bank management - it's just to make clear that this wasn't the finest hour for many players. All of these colliding factors became critically important when the marketplace, rating agencies and depositors focused on them.",

        "page_content": "As I write this letter, the current crisis is not yet over, and even when it is behind us, there will be repercussions from it for years to come. But importantly, recent events are nothing like what occurred during the 2008 global financial crisis (which barely a/ffected regional banks). In 2008, the trigger was a growing recognition that $1 trillion of consumer mortgages were about to go bad and they were owned by various types of entities around the world. At that time, there was enormous leverage virtually everywhere in the financial system. Major investment banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, nearly all savings and loan institutions, o/ff-balance sheet vehicles, AIG and banks around the world - all of them failed. This current banking crisis involves far fewer financial players and fewer issues that need to be resolved.\n\n## These failures were not good for banks of any size.\n\nAny crisis that damages Americans' trust in their banks damages all banks - a fact that was known even before this crisis. While it is true that this bank crisis 'benefited' larger banks due to the inflow of deposits they received from smaller institutions, the notion that this meltdown was good for them in any way is absurd.\n\n## Let's be very thoughtful in our reaction to recent events.\n\nWhile this crisis will pass, lessons will be learned, which will result in some changes to the regulatory system. However, it is extremely important that we avoid knee-jerk, whack-a-mole or politically motivated responses that often result in achieving the opposite of what people intended. Now is the time to deeply think through and coordinate complex regulations to accomplish the goals we want, eliminating costly ine/fficiencies and contradictory policies. Very often, rules are put in place in one part of the framework without appreciating their consequences in combination with other regulations. America has had, and continues to have, the best and most dynamic financial system in the world - from various types of investors to its banks, rule of law, investor protections, transparency, exchanges and other features. We do not want to throw the baby out with the bath water.\n\n## We should have common goals on how we want the banking system to work.\n\n- \u00b7 We want to strengthen regional, midsized and community banks, which are essential to the American economic system. They fill a critical role in small communities, o/ffering local knowledge and local relationships that some large banks simply can't provide - or can't provide cost-e/ffectively. Overall, we want to maintain the extraordinary strength this tiered system a/ffords. JPMorgan Chase directly supports this goal as we are one of the largest bankers in America to regional and community banks. We bank approximately 350 of America's 4,000+ banks across the country. This means we make loans to them or raise capital for them. In addition, we process payments for them, finance some of their mortgage activities, advise them on acquisitions, provide them with interest rate swaps and foreign exchange, and buy and sell securities for them. And we also finance their local communities (think hospitals, schools and larger companies) in ways they cannot.\n- \u00b7 We need large, complex banks to continue to play a critical role in the U.S. and global financial system. And we need to recognize that they do so in a way regional banks can't. Large banks are complex not because they want to be but because they operate in complex global markets. Regional banks simply cannot manage the scale and complexity of transactions in 50 or 60 countries around the world to help some of America's best and largest companies accomplish their goals. Think of equity, debt, M&A, research, swaps, foreign exchange, large payments systems, global custody and so on. It takes a global workforce with deep expertise and significant capabilities to provide these services. These large global banks finance not just the world's largest companies but the world's development institutions and even countries. Having some of the best large, complex banks in the world is essential to the success of America's biggest companies, its economic system and its global competitiveness, which says nothing against the importance of having great midsized and community banks as well.

While you don't want banks to fail all the time, it should be allowed to happen, and the resolution should follow a completely prescribed process. In almost all bank failures, uninsured deposits never resulted in lost money - but the very fear of loss can cause a run on any bank having characteristics similar to a bank that has failed. Resolution and recovery regulations did not work particularly well during the recent crisis - we should bring clarity and reassurance to both the unwinding process and measures to reduce the risk of additional bank runs. It should also be noted that banks pay for any bank failure (through fees paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) as they pay for the whole financial regulatory system. And yes, while these costs are ultimately passed on to their customers - that is true for all industries - the cost is just the price of implementing proper regulations.\n- \u00b7 We want proper transparency and strong regulations . However, it should be noted that regulations, the supervisory regime and the resolution regime currently in place did not stop SVB and Signature Bank from failing - and from causing systemwide issues. We should not aim for a regulatory regime that eliminates all failure but one that reduces the chance of failure and the odds of contagion. We should carefully study why this particular situation happened but not overreact.\n- Strong regulations should not only minimize bank failures but also help to maintain the strength of banks as both the guardians of the financial system and engines that finance the great American economic machine.\n- \u00b7 We should want market makers to have the ability to e/ffectively intermediate , particularly in di/fficult markets, with central banks only stepping in during exceptional situations. In the last few years, we have had many situations in which disruptions in the market were, in my opinion, largely caused by certain regulations that did\n- not improve the safety of the market maker but, instead, damaged the safety of the whole system. In addition, many of the new 'shadow bank' market makers are fair-weather friends they do not step in to help clients in tough times.\n- \u00b7 We need banks to be there for their clients in tough times . And they have been. Banks can flex their capital and provide their clients with a lot of loans and liquidity when they really need it. For example, at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis in March 2020, banks deployed over $500 billion in liquidity for clients and $500 billion in PPP loans - and this does not include banks' share of the nearly $2 trillion in loans that entered forbearance. Banks also play a unique and fundamental role in the transmission of monetary policy because deposits in banks can be loaned out, e/ffectively 'creating' money. Some regulations and some accounting rules have become too procyclical and make it harder to do this.\n- \u00b7 Regulation, particularly stress testing, should be more thoughtful and forward looking . It has become an enormous, mind-numbingly complex task about crossing t's and dotting i's. For example, the Fed's stress test focuses on only one scenario, which is unlikely to happen. In fact, this may lull risk committee members at any institution into a false sense of security that the risks they are taking are properly vetted and can be easily handled. A less academic, more collaborative reflection of possible risks that a bank faces would better inform institutions and their regulators about the full landscape of potential risks.\n- \u00b7 We should decide a priori what should stay in the regulatory system and what shouldn't .\n- There are reasons for certain choices, and they should not be the accidental outcome of uncoordinated decision making. Regulatory arbitrage is already forcing many activities, from certain types of lending to certain types of trading, outside the banking system. Among many questions that need definitive answers, a few big ones would be: Do you want the mortgage business, credit and market making, along with other essential financial services, inside the banking",

Under the new scheme, would nonbank credit-providing institutions be able to provide credit when their clients need them the most? I personally doubt that many of them could.\n\n## \u00b7 We need banks to be attractive investments .\n\n- It is in the interest of the financial system that banks not become 'un-investable' because of uncertainty around regulations that a/ffect capital, profitability and long-term investing. Erratic stress test capital requirements and constant uncertainty around future regulations damage the banking system without making it safer. While it is perfectly reasonable that a bank refrain from stock buybacks, dividends or growth under certain circumstances, it would be far better for the entire banking system if these rules were clearly enumerated (i.e., stipulate that a bank needs to reduce its buybacks and dividend if they breach certain thresholds).\n\nIf done properly, banking regulations could be calibrated - adding virtually no additional risk - to make it easier for banks to make loans, intermediate markets, finance the economy, manage a run on their bank and fail if need be. When it comes to political debate about banking regulations, there is little truth to the notion that regulations have been 'loosened,' at least in the context of large banks. (To the contrary, our capital requirements have been increasing for years, as shown on the chart on page 12.) The debate should not always be about more or less regulation but about what mix of regulations will keep America's banking system the best in the world , such as capital and leverage ratios, liquidity and what counts as liquidity, resolution rules, deposit insurance, securitization, stress testing, proper usage of the discount window, tailoring and other requirements (including potential requirements on shadow banks). Because of the recent problems, we can add to this mix the review of concentrated customers, uninsured deposits and potential limitations on the use of HTM portfolios. Ideally, new rules and regulations would also make it easier for banks to provide credit in tougher times.\n\n## ADJUSTING OUR STRATEGY TO THE NEW REGULATORY REALITY (BASEL III ENDGAME)\n\nThe Basel III Endgame (called Basel IV by some) which, incredibly , has been nearly 10 years in the making - seems likely to increase, yet again, capital requirements for banks in general, through higher operational risk changes, and for trading and capital markets activity in particular, among other things. Whether or not we agree with all these changes (and we've discussed these regulations in detail in prior letters), we will simply have to adjust to them immediately. It's important we describe to our shareholders how we will go about doing that and what it means for banks and, in particular, our bank.\n\n## First and foremost, banks must satisfy all of their regulators.\n\nWe must satisfy all of our regulators, and, remember, we have regulators all around the world, including more than 10 in the United States alone. Regulations include stress testing, reporting, compliance, legal obligations and trading surveillance, among others. While the business is the first line of defense on all these issues, we also have 3,700 people in compliance, 7,100 in risk and 1,400 lawyers actively working every day to meet the letter and the spirit of these rules along with the final line of defense - audit.\n\nRules are constantly changing and/or being enhanced and are sometimes, unfortunately, driven by political motivations. Relationships with regulators can often be intense, and, recently, we have lost some terrific people in our firm because of this. Regulators know that when banks disagree, we essentially have no choice - there is no one to appeal to, and even the act of appealing can make them angry. We simply ask respectfully to be heard, but at the end of the day, we will do what they ask us to do.",

The data illustrates this dynamic. We expect this trend to continue for all the reasons I've discussed.\n\n## Banks will continue to be guardians of the financial system.\n\nProperly regulated banks are meant to protect and enhance the financial system. They are transparent with regulators, and they strive mightily to protect the system from terrorism financing and tax evasion as they implement know your customer guidelines and anti-money laundering laws. They protect clients' assets and clients' money in movement. Banks also help customers - from\n\nprotecting their data and minimizing fraud and cyber risk to providing financial education - and must abide by social requirements, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to extend their services into lower-income communities. As mentioned previously, unlike the private market, banks do not always choose when to provide a product or service but need to be there for their clients when they need credit or liquidity the most.\n\n## Looking forward, we constantly modify our strategies to adjust to our market realities.\n\nIt's always best to adjust to new reality quickly. We really don't like crying over spilled milk, although we sometimes do. The new reality is that some things - for example, holding certain types of credit - are more e/fficiently done by a nonbank.",

        "page_content": "Here are some actions we are taking to help our business succeed in the current and future environments:\n\n- 1.  First and foremost, we must conclude that holding certain types of credit, loans or otherwise has generally become less profitable because of the high levels of capital that need to be held against it - generally more than the market demands. What this means is that some credit is better held in a nonbank. Increasingly, for a credit relationship to make sense, banks need a lot of noncredit-related revenue.\n- 2.  Because of various capital requirements, we try to reduce clients' nonoperating cash deposits.\n- 3.  We are seeking to implement much tighter management and execution of business strategies. This includes repricing certain businesses, running o/ff certain unprofitable products, changing the mix of business for a client, and more rigorously evaluating client selection and resource optimization applied to clients.\n- 4.  We are exploring new capital optimization strategies, which could include partnerships and perhaps one day more securitizations, among other opportunities.\n- 5.  Unfortunately, it is becoming increasingly di/fficult for banks to stay in the mortgage business, which ultimately hurts everyday Americans. The high costs of origination and servicing along with the complexity of regulations create a costly business with significant legal, reputational and operational challenges. In addition, given capital requirements and the lack of a healthy securitization market, it barely makes sense for banks to hold mortgages or mortgage-servicing rights. Many banks have already reduced much of this business. We are hanging on, continuing to hope for meaningful change.\n\n- 6.  We have the ability to add low-capital or no-capital revenue streams, like providing valuable data and analytics in trading, travel and other relevant o/ffers in the consumer bank, wealth management and payment services businesses, among others.\n\nIf you review our CEO letters, you will see that we have many growth opportunities in front of us and our plans to attack them. We face the future and the new competition, large and small, with confidence, strength and a dash of humility.\n\n## KEEPING AN EYE ON ALL OF OUR COMPETITORS\n\nThe growing competition to banks from each other, as well as shadow banks, fintechs and large technology companies, is intense and clearly contributing to the diminishing role of banks and public companies in the United States and the global financial system. The pace of change and the size of the competition are extraordinary, and activity is accelerating. Walmart, for example (with over 200 million in-store customers each week), can use new digital technologies to e/fficiently bring banking-type services to their customers. Apple, already a strong presence in banking-type services with Apple Pay and the Apple Card, is actively moving into other similar services such as payment processing, credit risk assessment, person-toperson payment systems, merchant acquiring and buy-now-pay-later o/ffers. Large tech companies, already 100% digital, have hundreds of millions of customers, as well as enormous resources, in data and proprietary systems - all of which give them an extraordinary competitive advantage.\n\nWe remain confident that as long as we stay vigilant, hungry, adaptable, fast and disciplined, we will continue to succeed in building this great company.",

        "page_content": "## Management Lessons\n\nAs recent countries and companies have demonstrated, great management and leadership are critical to any large organization's long-term success. While providing strong management is a disciplined and rigorous process - facts, analysis, detail, rinse and repeat - creating an exceptional management team is an art, not a science.\n\nIn the rest of this section, I talk about some management lessons - I always enjoy sharing what I have learned over time by watching others and through my own successes and failures.\n\n## BUILDING TRUE FRANCHISE VALUE\n\n## Accounting can distort actual economic reality.\n\nI have spoken in the past about good and bad revenue and good and bad expenses. Certain expenses, such as opening well-designed and well-located branches, actually are long-term investments of great value. Conversely, poorly underwritten credit creates revenue that you are bound to regret. Further, there are accounting practices that may distort the true value of actions you take. For example, when we create a new credit card account, we recognize origination costs over 12 months, but an average account exists for over eight years. And with the new accounting rules for loan loss reserves - called the current expected credit losses standard - you book the expected life of loan losses on the day you make the loan, while the revenue comes in over multiple years.\n\nIncreasingly in the modern world, many valuable things are not reflected on our balance sheet in generally accepted accounting principles - for example, previously expensed intellectual property or extraordinary human capital. At the end of the day, human capital is the most valuable asset. Think of a great athlete, a great lawyer or a great artist. It's not simply the equipment - it's the extraordinary training and talent of those involved, as we've also seen with the U.S. military. And sometimes it's not the individual but the highly coordinated activities of the team that deliver the championship.\n\nFinally, if any value is based upon models, one must really test the sensitivity of the outcome against changes in assumptions. Understanding the range of potential outcomes may be far more important than the point estimate created by a model. In some cases, you can have an excellent average outcome but with a chance of death.\n\nThe point is: Accounting can distort economic reality and can lead one to make the wrong decisions.\n\n## Building true franchise value requires an outcomes-based outlook.\n\nIn banking, specific examples illustrate how merely following accounting and capital rules - without thinking through the outcomes- can lead one astray. I'm going to describe just two examples, but there are hundreds more.\n\nIf you buy or create a loan at par and put it on your balance sheet at par (think of a mortgage) and internally finance it, even match-funded with 10% capital, you might believe you have a 12% return. Many companies subscribe to this interpretation and simply continue to borrow money to invest in such a thing. But I would tell you this product has",

        "page_content": "no franchise value because it is only worth par, and, in fact, a small change in that value (because of interest rates and credit spread) could mean that you have made a huge mistake. If, on the other hand, you create a loan and sell it at more than par at a profit, you have created value whether or not you keep it on your balance sheet. And far more important, if you create a loan and at the same time forge a client relationship - and you add additional capital-light revenue, such as asset management and cash management - you have created something of long-term value that you can nurture and grow. This is franchise value.\n\nSimply taking interest rate risk (which contributed to the downfall of SVB) is not a business. Nor is simply taking credit risk. One person and a computer will su/ffice - you do not need 290,000 people circling the globe to do that.\n\nAnother example relates to any branch-based business. Let's say I build a system with welldesigned and well-located branches, sta/ffed by well-trained personnel who can o/ffer customers great products and services and who strive to do every task a little bit better. Then you build a branch system with outdated sites in poor locations (often to save money) that have undertrained and underpaid sta/ff and lower-quality products and services. Between the two, my branch system will win every time. One system will have high franchise value and be self-perpetuating with high returns. The other enterprise is probably on the road to eventual failure. If you study the history of business, you can see this phenomenon play out in grocery stores, car companies, restaurants, retailers and various other enterprises.\n\n## LEARNING FROM INVESTOR DAY\n\nIn February 2021, we did not hold our annual Investor Day for the obvious reason - COVID-19. When February 2022 came around, we were somewhat happy to be relieved of that responsibility again. Investor Day is a tremendous amount of work. But from 2020 to 2022, we did a lot of investment spending and made several acquisitions. Some of our analysts questioned whether we were being transparent enough in terms of what we were doing and why we were doing it. While sometimes we get frustrated with investor demands - and not all investors are created equally - all investors should be treated fairly and with respect. So, in 2022, we gave it more thought and reversed course with an extensive Investor Day. Our senior management team explained in detail our acquisitions and our investments, answering every question to the best of their ability. Having to explain your business to investors, comparing yourself with competitors and looking at the business as a whole - across sales, marketing, returns, growth, risks and strategic opportunities - was a terrific exercise for us . We learned our lesson!\n\nThis also raises another issue. Of course, it is critically important to analyze your business at the right disaggregated level - right down to the branch - inside the company. But it is also important to have the proper segments reported externally to the company, properly accounted for and generally aligned to their relevant competitors. This actually helps hold managers accountable by forcing them to accurately assess performance the good, the bad and the ugly - without any attempts to avoid reality through an external obfuscation of results.",

We often go further than that statement to say that we need to be there for them, in good times and in bad. However, banking is a complex industry, and this customer-centric approach requires a little more explanation.\n\nIn our business, we are essentially a financial partner to a client. While we strive to build great client relationships based on trust over the long run, our role has intricacies. For example, we do not need every transaction to make economic sense - just the overall client relationship, year after year. Whatever the transaction, we need to be properly compensated for the risks we bear, which can be extraordinary. Very often, a client will merely look for the lowest price, which we completely understand; we recognize that sometimes banks are perfectly willing to make a certain transaction for a client at a loss. There are also occasions when we need to tell a client that a specific financial transaction would be imprudent - maybe for us and the client.\n\nSay, for example, that a very strong client of ours is simply trying to get the best price for a leveraged loan. If we believe the desired price is unwise and another institution is willing to o/ffer it, we will advise the client to take that option. For us, this is pure counterparty risk and not really part of our core relationship. Conversely, should the same\n\nclient come to us and request something that extends beyond what we consider reasonable for that transaction, we may nonetheless do it. Perhaps the client is in the middle of an M&A transaction in di/fficult markets and simply cannot get the financing they need - other than from us. In recent crises, we have often gone the extra mile for a client at great risks to ourselves, not to make a profit but to rescue the client from financial calamity.\n\nFundamentally, putting the client first means always providing them with the products and services they need (although they may go somewhere else because of price) and having our whole team work hard for them - either in the United States or around the world, reliably and with constancy. One of the most important things we do for a client, above all else, is to be a steady hand, providing financial safety and security at every turn.",

        "page_content": "## Some Commonsense Principles for Corporate Governance\n\nI have written before about the diminishing role of public companies in the American financial system. They peaked in 1996 at 7,300 and now total 4,600. Conversely, the number of private U.S. companies backed by private equity firms has grown from 1,900 to 11,200 over the last two decades. And this does not include the increasing number of companies owned by sovereign wealth funds and family o/ffices. This migration is serious and worthy of critical study, and it may very well increase with more regulation and litigation coming. We really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?\n\nThere are good reasons for such healthy private markets, and some good outcomes have resulted from them as well. The reasons are complex and may include public market factors such as onerous reporting requirements, higher litigation expenses, costly regulations, cookie-cutter board governance, less compensation flexibility, heightened public scrutiny and the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings.\n\nWith intensified public reporting, investors' growing needs for environmental, social and governance information and the universal proxy - which makes it very easy to put disruptive directors on a board - the pressure to become a private company will rise. Corporate governance principles are becoming more and more templated and formulaic, which is a negative trend. For example, sometimes proxy advisors automatically judge board members unfavorably if they have been on the board a long time, without a fair assessment of their actual contributions or experience. And some simple, sensible governance principles are far better than the formulaic ones. The governance of major corporations is evolving into a bureaucratic compliance exercise instead of focusing on its relationship to long-term economic value. Good corporate governance is critical, and a little common sense would go a long way.\n\n## PROMOTING OPEN COMMUNICATION AND TRUST WITH THE BOARD\n\nAs authorized and coordinated by the board, directors should have unfettered access to management, including those below the CEO's direct reports. At every board meeting, to ensure open and free discussion, the full board should meet in executive session without the CEO or other members of management. The independent directors should ensure that they have enough time to do this properly.\n\nThis one act would allow the board to have a completely open conversation and provide candid feedback to the CEO and management team. Good CEOs, who are trying to do the best job they can, should appreciate this important feedback - and should know how di/fficult it is to gather in a large group. This type of quality discussion among and with board members leads to collaboration and good succession planning since every meeting should include a real conversation around this important topic. Meetings such as these allow the board to nurture the extraordinary value of collaboration and trust.\n\n## CONFRONTING SUCCESSION PLANNING\n\nOur board is responsible for succession planning, and it is on the agenda every time board members meet - both when they are with me and when I am not in the room. We already have a 'hit-by-thetruck' plan ready to go (not all companies can say this), and we have multiple successor candidates who are well-known to the board and to the investor community. The board believes this is one of its paramount priorities. You can rest assured that our board members are on the case and are very comfortable with where we are.",

        "page_content": "## ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH ASSET MANAGERS\n\nWe - companies and investors - need to become more active and involved in proxy issues each year to foster better communication between the investors and the board of the companies they own. Whether it's issues around climate risk or say on pay, it should be appropriate for the management team or board to actively engage with investors during proxy season to hear and understand each other's views on key issues and communicate their positions in real time . Investors should also require proxy advisors to share any communications they have with a company in real time before investors make voting decisions. In my view, too many portfolio managers and investors have partially ceded critical decisions on key proxy issues to their internal stewardship groups or external proxy advisors. Stewardship teams are also often under pressure to follow proxy advisors by bureaucratic internal systems at investment firms that discourage disagreement and encourage the safety of the herd. Many portfolio managers have told me that even when they have the authority to override the internal group, it is frequently very di/fficult to do so.\n\n## The new universal proxy is likely to create havoc for companies.\n\nThe new universal proxy makes it such that one investor with one share, who owns it for as little as one day, can nominate a director for any reason, at relatively low cost. In my view, it is likely that not just activists but also special interest groups will nominate directors. Not only would this be extremely disruptive to the board, but, almost by their nature, special interest groups would be counter to shareholders' interests. While we fully respect being transparent - protecting investors and shareholder rights - director election processes are becoming too far removed from shareholder interests.\n\nWhile there are legitimate complaints against entrenched boards, good boards often tend to interview prospective candidates for their brains, integrity, work ethic, management and collaboration skills, and experience. With this new universal proxy, it's easy to envision a time when a proxy season will be like a political campaign, with interest groups on both sides of an issue trying to elect a board member. Disruptive boards, which can be caused by just a single troublesome member, are an anathema to shareholders' interests. This is unlikely to end well.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluating and Managing the Economic and Geopolitical Risks Ahead\n\nWe usually don't worry about typical economic fluctuations and often compare economic forecasting with weather forecasting: It is extremely complicated, easy to do in the short term and far more di/fficult to do in the long run. It is particularly hard to forecast true longer-term inflection points in the economy. Although we don't want to waste time on 'normal' fluctuations, we do want to be prepared for economic extremes - we look at multiple possibilities and probabilities and manage our company so that we can handle all of them , whether or not we think they actually will happen. After we spoke last year about storm clouds, some of those storms did indeed hit, and, unfortunately, some of those threatening clouds are still here.\n\n2022 was not normal, economically speaking, and, in fact, 2022 witnessed several dramatic events the Ukraine war began; inflation hit a 40-year high of 9%; the federal funds rate experienced one of its most rapid increases, up 425 basis points, albeit from a low level; stock markets were down 20%; unemployment fell to a 50-year low at 3.5%; and the U.S. economy was bolstered by frequent fiscal stimulus and by high and rising government debt while supply chain issues eased. In addition, work from home began to raise commercial real estate challenges, and, finally, long- and shortterm interest rates presented a sharply inverted yield curve, which is 'eight for eight' in terms of predicting a recession (more on this later). But, surprisingly, the global economy marched ahead.\n\n## THE CURRENT ECONOMY: PRETTY GOOD BUT STORM CLOUDS AHEAD\n\nUntil the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the current economy was performing adequately, both here in the United States and remarkably better than anyone expected in Europe. The 'market' was generally forecasting either a soft landing or a mild recession, with interest rates peaking at 5% and then slowly coming down.\n\nThere has been a lot of market volatility over the past year, partially, in my opinion, as people over-extrapolate monthly data, which is highly distorted by inflation, supply chain adjustments, consumer substitution, basically poor assumptions about housing costs and other factors. But underlying all this, consumers have been spending 7% to 9% more than in the prior year and 23% more than pre-COVID-19. Similarly, their balance sheets are in great shape as they still have, according to our own analysis, $1.2 trillion more 'excess cash' in their checking accounts than before the pandemic (credit card debt is simply normalizing). In addition, unemployment is extremely low, and wages are going up, particularly at the low end. We've had 10 years of home and stock price appreciation, and even if we go into a recession, consumers would enter it in far better shape than during the great financial crisis. Finally, supply chains are recovering, businesses are pretty healthy and credit losses are extremely low.\n\nThe failures of SVB and Credit Suisse have significantly changed the market's expectations, bond prices have recovered dramatically, the stock market is down and the market's odds of a recession have increased. And while this is nothing like 2008, it is not clear when this current crisis will end. It has provoked lots of jitters in the market and will clearly cause some tightening of financial conditions as banks and other lenders become more conservative. However, it is unclear whether this disruption is likely to slow consumer spending (as of April 1, 2023, spending has been consistently running higher versus the prior year). Although higher rates, particularly in mortgages, have reduced both home sales and prices, do remember that consumer spending drives more than 65% of the U.S. economy.",

Nonetheless, we do have other unique and complicated issues in front of us, which are outlined in the chart above.\n\n## POTENTIAL TROUBLE BREWING FROM UNPRECEDENTED FISCAL SPENDING, QUANTITATIVE TIGHTENING AND GEOPOLITICAL TENSIONS\n\nHaving already confessed to how di/fficult it is to predict the future, for planning purposes it still makes sense to try to assess the environment ahead by laying out those factors that may be significantly di/fferent from the past.\n\n## Fiscal stimulus is still surging through the system.\n\nIn the last three years, partially but not entirely due to the pandemic, the federal government had a deficit of $3.1 trillion (2020), $2.8 trillion (2021) and $1.4 trillion (2022). These are extraordinary numbers, which ended up in consumers' pockets, in states and local municipalities, and even in companies. We pointed out last year that you simply cannot have this level of spending and say that it's not inflationary. It's also important to point out that there is a multiplier e/ffect of this stimulus; that is, one person's spending is another person's income and so on. The deficit for the next three years is now estimated to be $1.4 trillion to $1.8\n\n- \uf06e Unpredictable war\n- \uf06e Energy and food crisis averted for now\n- \uf06e Disproportionate su/ffering imposed on poor people and nations\n- \uf06e Inflationary trade adjustments\n- \uf06e Economic alliances in flux\n- \uf06e Potential for rising oil and gas prices\n- \uf06e Huge economic and geopolitical strains\n\ntrillion per year, which is also an extraordinary number, with no end in sight. In Europe, fiscal deficits are high - even before the enormous subsidies given to consumers to counterbalance higher energy prices. It's also important to note that borrowing to invest is fundamentally di/fferent from borrowing to consume - borrowing to consume can only be inflationary.\n\nThis is before any additional costs related to future recessions, the war or any other unforeseeable events. O/ffsetting this, by sometime late this year or early next year, we expect consumers will have spent the bulk of their remaining excess savings. It remains to be seen whether this will cause a little bit of a cli/ff e/ffect or whether consumer spending will simply slow down. Either way, this will add to whatever recessionary pressures there are sometime in the future.\n\n## Today's quantitative tightening is following more than a decade of quantitative easing.\n\nIn the two years after COVID-19, the Fed bought $4.5 trillion of U.S. Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities, bringing its total balance sheet to $9 trillion. We have experienced almost 12 years of quantitative easing (QE), which drove interest rates down - so much so that U.S. shortterm rates were virtually zero, and the 10-year bond hit a low of 0.5%. Amazingly, tens of trillions of dollars of debt, mostly in Europe, sold at negative interest rates (we will look back upon this with total astonishment). This period of QE also led to extraordinary liquidity (and a surging money\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n>\n\n## In Front of Us: Storm Clouds Ahead",

        "page_content": "supply) that undoubtedly drove increased prices across many investment classes - from stocks and bonds to crypto, meme stocks and real estate, among others. Importantly, this also increased bank deposits from $13 trillion to $18 trillion (and the now-famous uninsured deposits from $6 trillion to $8 trillion).\n\nQE is now being reversed into quantitative tightening (QT) as the Fed grapples with inflation. So far, the Fed has reduced its securities holdings by approximately $550 billion and is committed to reducing its holdings by almost $100 billion in securities each month or over $1 trillion each year.\n\nHow all this will unfold is still unknown as the direction and speed of money have changed significantly from prior years. To varying degrees, banks will compete for money, not only among one another but also with money market funds, other investments and the Fed itself. Money market fund total assets under management have increased by $650 billion since April 2022, with a significant portion migrating into the Fed's reverse repo facility, thereby draining deposits from the banking system. So while the Fed's balance sheet has come down by approximately $550 billion, deposits at the banks have come down by $1 trillion, largely uninsured deposits. Unfortunately, some banks invested much of these excess deposits in 'safe' Treasuries, which, of course, went down in value as rates rose faster than most people expected.\n\nIt should be noted that an inordinate amount of attention is focused on short-term interest rates, which the Fed a/ffects directly. But the Fed does not completely control long-term rates and liquidity, which are influenced by both supply and demand (QT) and global investor preferences and sentiment - importantly, including views on risk and safety. It is also important to remember that while the central banks of the world are now selling instead of buying securities, the governments of the world have larger debts to finance. The United States alone needs to sell $2 trillion in securities, which must be absorbed in the market. This turn of events is generally true globally.\n\nThere has been huge intervention by central banks around the world over the last decade. While it was completely necessary in 2008 and 2009 to stop the worst of the global financial crisis, and again in\n\n2020 to stop the e/ffects of the global pandemic, the depth and breadth of these interventions will be studied for years as will the extent to which we need QT (whose full e/ffect may not be known immediately). It is unclear how the Fed incorporated the enormous fiscal spending into both its forecasts for growth and inflation, as well as its need to continue QE as it did. And importantly, the Fed's ability to reverse course on this strategy (QT) is somewhat constrained by higher inflation (though, of course, it can temporarily adjust its actions to deal with the current bank failure crisis).\n\n## War complicates geopolitics and materially adds risks.\n\nWe have not had a major land war in Europe since 1945. The war in Ukraine, already into its second year, has been particularly devastating in terms of casualties and damage and has been haunted by the threat of nuclear weapons. It may very well last for many more years. Wars are unpredictable, and at the start, most predictions about how they will end have been completely wrong.\n\nThis war is also a/ffecting global energy and food supplies, with a disproportionate and negative e/ffect falling on poor people and poorer nations, including millions of Ukrainian refugees. There is still a risk that energy and food supply lines, which are not secure, will lead to higher prices and the large migration of people, triggering another level of geopolitical dislocation.\n\nThe tensions of this war are also leading to the rethinking of many economic alliances, as well as trade and national security. All these factors create more risk and potentially higher inflation, and their confluence (along with inflation and QT) creates a somewhat unpredictable and dangerous outcome.\n\n## This may be a once-in-a-generation sea change, with material e/ffect.\n\nOf course, there is always uncertainty. I am often frustrated when people talk about today's uncertainty as if it were any di/fferent from yesterday's uncertainty. However, in this case, I believe it actually is.",

        "page_content": "Less predictable geopolitics, in general, and a complex adjustment to relationships with China are probably leading to higher military spending and a realignment of global economic and military alliances.\n\nHigher fiscal spending, higher debt to gross domestic product (GDP), higher investment spend in general (including climate spending), higher energy costs and the inflationary e/ffect of trade adjustments all lead me to believe that we may have gone from a savings glut to scarce capital and may be headed to higher inflation and higher interest rates than in the immediate past.\n\nEssentially, we may be moving, as I read somewhere, from a virtuous cycle to a vicious cycle.\n\n## PREPARING FOR WHAT MAY BE A NEW AND UNCERTAIN FUTURE\n\nOf course, we hope that everything turns out okay and that all of these storm clouds peacefully and painlessly dissipate - and we need to be prepared for that outcome. We also need to be prepared for a new and uncertain future. The new risks (in addition to the normal ones, like recession) are higher inflation for longer, the market e/ffects of QT and growing political risks. Of course, I cannot be sure this will happen, but I place higher odds on it than the 'market.'\n\n## Managing risks is far more than simply meeting the Fed's annual stress test.\n\nWhile it is critical that we meet and pass the Fed's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test, managing risk is far more than that and we are fairly fanatical when it comes to managing risk. Our company does hundreds of stress tests a week, which include market movements reflective of many past crises (such as volatility resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the pandemic in 2020) and rapidly rising interest rates .\n\nThe Fed's CCAR stress test, by its nature, has fairly arbitrary results since it uses only one di/fferent and hypothetical scenario each year. This creates uncertainty around our capital requirements (as I mentioned, this may damage the value of bank stocks and the banking system). If I were a shareholder, I would want to know if my company would\n\nreally lose the $44 billion after taxes (over a nine-quarter period) that the stress test shows. And the answer is absolutely not.\n\nWhile I understand why regulators stress test this way - they are essentially trying to ensure that banks survive the worst-case scenario (which assumes multiple problems at a struggling bank without any benefit from good management or rapid response) - the methodology clearly does not result in an accurate forecast of how our company would perform under adverse circumstances. I have very little doubt that if the severely adverse scenario played out, JPMorgan Chase would perform far better than the stress test projections. I believe we would actually make money over the nine quarters in the Fed's stress scenario.\n\nHere's one example that illustrates this. From March 5 to March 20, 2020, when the stock market fell 24% and the bond index spread gapped from 191 to 446 basis points prior to major Fed intervention, our actual trading revenue was higher than normal as we actively made markets for our clients. By contrast, the hypothetical stress test had us losing a huge amount of money in market making, based on the way it is calculated. One more thing to point out: JPMorgan Chase now has enough total loss-absorbing capacity to bear out peak CCAR losses (using the Fed's numbers) more than eight times over .\n\nIn addition to CCAR testing, we stress test for various types of huge market disruptions. For example, we stress counterparties - such as hedge funds, large asset managers or trading houses for extremely large market moves, perhaps an instantaneous 130 basis point move in Treasuries or 50% to 60% moves in commodities. Our shareholders should know that regarding any major international bank, we remain well-collateralized across all of our exposures. Even if one of those banks went bankrupt overnight, we would be okay. While there is always a risk that we won't receive a margin call or that some trades may default and leave us exposed to large market risk, the losses likely would not be material.\n\nSu/ffice it to say, our company prepares not only for various forms of extreme economic risk but for various forms of geopolitical risk. Later in this letter I describe how we have enhanced those e/fforts.",

        "page_content": "## Don't underestimate the extreme importance of interest rates.\n\nInterest rates are extraordinarily important - they are the cosmological constant, or the mathematical certainty, that a/ffects all things economic. Before I comment on that, I want to share some astounding numbers to illustrate this point:\n\n## Net present value (NPV) of $1.00 annuity\n\n|                   | Lifetime  NPV   | % NPV in first 10 years   |\n|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|\n| 1% interest rate  | $100            | 9%                        |\n| 10% interest rate | $10             | 61%                       |\n\nWhen you analyze a stock, you look at many factors: earnings, cash flow, competition, margins, scenarios, consumer preferences, new technologies and so on. But the math above is immovable and a/ffects all.\n\nIn a rapidly rising rate environment, any investment where the cash flows were expected in the out years would have been dramatically a/ffected think venture capital or real estate development, for example. Any form of carry trade (e/ffectively borrowing short and investing long) would be sorely disappointed. Carry trade exists not just in banks but is embedded and is silently present in companies, investment vehicles and others, including situations that require recurring refinancing.\n\n## We are prepared for potentially higher interest rates, and we may have higher inflation for longer.\n\nIf we have higher inflation for longer, the Fed may be forced to increase rates higher than people expect despite the recent bank crisis. Also, QT may have ongoing impacts that might, over time, be another force, pushing longer-term rates higher than currently envisioned. This may occur even if we have a mild - or not-so-mild - recession, as we saw in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nToday's inverted yield curve implies that we are going into a recession. As someone once said, an inverted yield curve like this is 'eight for eight' in predicting a recession in the next 12 months. However, it may not be true this time because of the enormous e/ffect of QT. As previously stated, longer-term rates are not necessarily controlled by central banks, and it is possible that the inversion we see today is still driven by prior QE and not the dramatic change in supply and demand that is going to take place in the future.\n\nWe have always looked at the 'fat tails' of higher interest rates, particularly on our own company. We were premature in thinking about the possibility of interest rates going to 5%, 6% or 7% - which still might not happen, but we always want to be protected against this outcome. For example, we have spoken about stockpiling cash, not investing in sovereign debt when rates were low and being willing to forgo income to protect against rising rates. Rest assured, our company can handle significantly higher interest rates no matter how anyone analyzes capital.\n\nHigher interest rates will obviously have an important impact, not just for banks but for some of those who borrow on a floating rate or those who have to refinance in a higher rate environment. If this tide goes out, you should assume that it will expose additional weaknesses in the economy. However, our company is prepared - not only for higher rates but for a potential recession that could arise and related credit losses. That preparation includes analyzing all of our clients (in particular our leveraged lending, real estate and other clients) for what the impact of higher rates may mean for them. We believe the risks within our own portfolio are manageable. And we try to analyze the impact of these factors on companies and industries away from us. For example, we do expect that some types of real estate in certain locations may come under pressure.\n\nFinally, we assume all of these risks and uncertainties will result in volatile markets.",

We cannot and should not ever be reliant on processes that can and will be used against us, especially when we are most vulnerable. All countries will be protecting their national security in their own way, tailoring their strategies as they see fit.\n- \u00b7  Countries will also be taking specific action to protect critical industries (think electric vehicles (EV), AI and chips) that may not be directly related to national security but are key to national competitiveness. This is essentially what America's IRA is meant to do.\n- \u00b7  Companies will diversify their supply chains simply to be more resilient.\n\nThis restructuring will likely take place over time and does not need to be excessively disruptive. There will be winners and losers - some of the main beneficiaries will be Brazil, Canada, Mexico and friendly Southeast Asian nations.\n\nFor similar national security reasons, activities including investment activities - that help create a national security risk (e.g., sharing critical technology with potential adversaries) should be restricted.\n\nWhile focusing on the risks, it's also important not to forget the opportunities. The transition to a green economy will eventually require $4 trillion a year in capital expenditures. The IRA, CHIPS Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law combined will create huge opportunities for companies, investors and entrepreneurs across virtually every industry group in the United States. You can rest assured that our company is organizing to help clients make the most of these opportunities.\n\nAlong with reconfiguring our supply chains, we must create new trading systems with our allies. My preference would be to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership - it is the best geostrategic trade arrangement possible with allied nations. You can be certain that our company is closely monitoring and adjusting to the risks and opportunities created by current events.\n\nBelieve it or not, inflation and interest rates are not the things that worry me the most. I'm most concerned about large geopolitical events, cyber attacks, nuclear proliferation, large dysfunctional markets (partially due to poorly calibrated regulations; e.g., the U.K. Gilt and U.S. Treasury markets) and failure of other critical infrastructure.\n\n## We have established a new Security Forum.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has exposed the severity, complexity and interconnectivity of threats such as physical security, the loss of nonbank critical infrastructure (i.e., communication networks), pandemics, insider threats, trade relations, political risk, sanctions, data privacy, war, and the impact of regulatory and governmental actions. All these factors a/ffect our company, as well as our clients and countries and their governments. You should know that we have formed a new Security Forum , which meets periodically and enables management to continually assess the impact of ongoing threats to our company, our clients and countries around the globe. These risks - which include market risk, credit risk, cyber risk and operational risk, among others - are also covered at the board level by our Risk Committee.\n\nFinally, when one talks about risk for too long, it begins to cloud your judgment. Looking ahead, the positives are huge.  However events play out, it is likely that 20 years from now, America's GDP will be more than twice the size it is today, and hundreds of millions of people around the world will have been lifted out of poverty.

We accept it too readily. And it damages the confidence we have in our own country. I have enormous respect for the people who work for the U.S. government, but we simply don't invest enough in making it more e/ffective. Some examples are: antiquated systems at the Federal Aviation Administration, United States Postal Service and Internal Revenue Service; ine/fficient ports and crumbling infrastructure; an ine/ffective immigration policy; policies that prevent a/ffordable housing and leave apartments vacant; policies that hurt Puerto Rico; tenure versus merit-based compensation and promotion; and work rules that dramatically reduce e/fficiency. We have a vast system with a lack of accountability and proper reporting. And usually when reports are issued, they only address how much money was spent - not, for example, how many highway miles were built, in what time period and at what cost. Government, which is 20% of the economy, seems to be getting less productive over time, unlike the rest of the economy. In addition, we have too much litigation - this is the bureaucratization of America - think Europe.\n\nTo be completely fair, I am also frustrated with the typically shortsighted selfishness of some businesses, asking for abundant special tax breaks and often using regulations to protect the incumbent. I also want to express exasperation with some of my fellow citizens who don't pay the taxes they owe on the order of $600 billion a year, who won't consider sensible policy measures like a carbon tax to stem climate change and who sometimes seem to only like democracy when the voters agree with them. Democracy by its nature is compromise. One of the lessons of the past decade is that if major legislation cannot be done in a bipartisan way, maybe it should not be done at all.\n\n## DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE POLICY AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT\n\nTheology is not policy. Policy based on falsehood or oversimplified facts is doomed to failure. Too often now, policy starts as politics without the benefit of analytics and experts.\n\n## Policy should precede politics - not the other way around.\n\nPolicy should be painstakingly developed based on facts and analysis (and on information about how policies were productively developed in other parts of the world). You can e/ffectively crowdsource policy expertise. Why were Germany and Switzerland so successful with apprenticeship programs? Why were Canada and Singapore so e/ffective with permitting and infrastructure? All policies, like education, infrastructure and regulation, need to start with an agreed-upon goal - and be comprehensive and coordinated to accomplish it. After the core of a policy is developed, then, of course, it will be modified by political leaders - but it is hoped the core of the policy remains intact. If those modifications bastardize it in such a way as to render it ine/fficient, it should be dropped.\n\n## We require a 21 st century government.\n\nIn a company, you are constantly setting up your organization for success. We need to find a way to more rapidly reorganize our government for the new world. While Congress can often move very quickly in a crisis, we are unable to move quickly as a government over the medium term. We need to move faster, adopt new technologies and retrain human capital more quickly. Even in a good company, reorganizing for change can be hard business and sta/ff units fight to maintain their status quo and perceived prerogatives as if their lives were at stake. I can only imagine how hard this is in the government, but it will only get worse if we do not fix this in our fast-changing world.",

        "page_content": "## The West Needs America's Leadership\n\nHow the U.S. can marshal its strengths-not only military but also moral, economic and diplomatic\n\n## By Jamie Dimon\n\nR ussia's invasion of Ukraine punctured many assumptions about the future of the world and thus was a pivotal moment in history. America and the West can no longer maintain a false sense of security based on the illusion that dictatorships and oppressive nations won't use their  economic  and  military  powers  to advance  their  aims-particularly  against what they perceive as weak, incompetent and disorganized Western democracies. In a  troubled  world,  we  are  reminded  that national  security  is  and  always  will  be paramount, even if it seems to recede in tranquil times.\n\nIt should also lay to rest the idea that America can stand alone. U.S. leaders must always put America first, but global peace and order is a vital American interest. Only America has the full capability to lead and coalesce  the  Western  world,  though  we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allies. Without cohesiveness and unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide  and  conquer  the  bickering  West. America needs to lead with its strengthsnot only military but also economic, diplomatic and moral. Here's what we can do:\n\n\u00b7 Rededicate ourselves to the qualities and principles that made America great. These principles are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the idea that all people are created equal. Democracy and human freedom are inseparable from freedom of speech, freedom of religion and free enterprise. It would help to educate all Americans about the sacrifice of those who came before us for democracy at home and abroad.\n\nWe need to acknowledge the critical role that government  plays-and  we  need government  to  be  more  competent  and accountable. We must build stronger safety nets to care for the poor, the old and the disabled,  and  to  cushion  adjustment  to economic change, while also maintaining economic dynamism, individual responsibility and the dignity of work. We must confront crises and failures of public policy by  developing  better  policies  and  by dealing with realities. We can recognize the mistakes America has made without disparaging the nation.\n\nWe  support  global  human  rights  and stand on the side of liberty, but we also have to be realistic about the compromises\n\nnecessary to accomplish long-term goals. Remember  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt  and Winston Churchill allied with Stalin against Hitler's imminent threat.\n\n\u00b7 Develop a Marshall Plan for global energy and food security. This will be critical  both  in  keeping  the  Western alliances  together  and  minimizing  the global  suffering  caused  by  starvation. Global energy and food supply chains are precarious by their nature. And it should be  self-evident  that  energy  security  and preventing climate change aren't contradictory:  Secure  and  reliable  oil  and  gas production  is  compatible  with  reducing CO2 over the long run, and is far better than  burning  more  coal.  It  should  also be self-evident that global food and energy security relies on realistic trade policy and American military strength.\n\n\u00b7 Increase  military  spending,  along with our allies, as much as necessary to protect the world. Not only is America a bastion of freedom; it is still the arsenal of democracy, and economic sanctions are no substitute  for  an  effective  military.  'We know only too well that war comes not when the forces of freedom are strong, but when they are weak,' as Ronald Reagan said in 1980. Military strength needs to be combined and coordinated with strong diplomatic and economic aid for the developing  world.  Thoughtful  policies  would help  many  nations  lift  up  their  people, develop their human rights and join economic unions that are good for all involved.\n\n\u00b7 Recover our economic dynamism. A strong  economy  is  the  foundation  for American power, and we haven't focused enough  on  economic  growth. Between 2000 and 2020, real U.S. GDP grew at an average  rate  of  only  1.7%  a  year.  Had we grown at 3% instead, last year's gross domestic product per person would have been $15,000 higher. That would help pay for much of what we need to do as a nation.\n\nEconomic growth will repair the fraying of the American dream, particularly if we share the wealth by improving education and wages for lower-paid citizens. There are many effective ways to do this, such as raising minimum wages and expanding the earned-income tax credit. We must also fix the immigration policies that are tearing us apart, dramatically reducing illegal immigration and dramatically increasing legal immigration. Economic growth will reduce\n\ninflation,  reduce  the  deficit,  and  make  it easier to afford the strong military we need. We  aren't  going  to  have  the  economic growth we need with the legal, regulatory and bureaucratic system we have today.\n\nGlobal trade will necessarily be restructured so that we don't rely on potential adversaries for critical goods and services. This  will  require  more  'industrial  planning' than America is used to-and we must ensure it is properly done and is not used for political purposes. Yet America should also open its arms, through trade and aid, to all other nations. Most developing countries would prefer to align economically with the West if we help them solve their problems. We should develop a new strategic and economic framework to make ourselves their partner of choice.\n\n\u00b7 Deal  with  China  thoughtfully  and without fear. America still has an enormously strong hand-plenty of food, water and energy; peaceful neighbors; and what is still the most prosperous and dynamic economy the world has ever seen, with a per person GDP of over $75,000 a year. We  can  have  faith  that  our  system  will maintain the economic dynamism we need. China has done a great job lifting up its nation and bringing its GDP per person up to $13,000 a year. Yet any fair assessment must recognize its challenges-not enough food, water and energy; a very complex geopolitical situation with tough neighbors; a lack of freedom that creates economic rigidity and malinvestment.\n\nWhether you think it is a competitor or a potential  adversary,  we,  along  with  our allies,  should firmly negotiate with China (where my company and its predecessor firms have done business for more than a century). We should acknowledge that we have  common  interests  in  combating nuclear proliferation, climate change and terrorism. Tough but thoughtful negotiations over strategic, military and economic concerns-including unfair competitionshould yield a better situation for all. If America leads well, China will be better off  forming  partnerships  with  a  strong Western world than with Russia, Iran and other such nations.\n\nTogether, we can ensure America's leadership for the next 100 years.\n\nMr.  Dimon  is  Chairman  and  CEO  of JPMorgan Chase & Co.",

        "page_content": "## CREATING A COMPREHENSIVE GLOBAL ECONOMIC STRATEGY\n\nJust as we need a comprehensive military strategy, globally, to deal with future security risks, we need a comprehensive global economic strategy to deal with future economic risks. Done properly, this will help strengthen and coalesce the Western democratic alliances over an extended period of time. This strategy has four pillars.\n\n## First, we need a U.S. growth strategy.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2022, real U.S. GDP grew at an average rate of only 2% a year. Had we grown at 3% instead, last year's GDP per person would have been $15,000 higher. That would help pay for much of what we need to do as a nation. We simply have not focused enough on growing the U.S. economy.\n\nIn prior letters, we have spoken about how we need to get public policy right to address a multitude of areas, which span ine/ffective education systems, soaring healthcare costs, excessive regulation and bureaucracy, the inability to plan and build infrastructure e/fficiently, inequitable taxes, a capricious and wasteful litigation system, frustrating immigration policies and reform, ine/fficient mortgage markets and housing markets and housing policy, a partially untrained and unprepared labor force, excessive student debt, and the lack of proper federal government budgeting and spending. I believe that our poor policies have restrained our growth, and simply improving those policies would accelerate our growth.\n\nWe should also focus on reducing the worker shortages by allowing both more merit-based immigration and seasonal immigration. Reducing trade barriers could also have a rapid e/ffect, and decreasing regulations and bureaucracy would be helpful. For example, starting a small business today generally requires multiple licenses, which take precious months to get. But it doesn't end there. Talk with any small business owner, and that person will describe the mountains of red tape, ine/fficient systems and huge amount of documentation involved to operate the business. We need to reduce the burdens that are imposed on those who want to open and run a small business.\n\nBy seeking a bold, comprehensive approach, we increase our ability to positively impact economic growth and jobs; in fact, this is also the best way to reduce inflation and the deficit.\n\n## Second, an industrial policy, done properly, could drive growth and also protect our national security.\n\nThe United States has essentially never had an 'industrial policy,' a strategy by which the federal government, through incentives and policies, drives American industry. We have done it indirectly through things like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and NASA's moon mission but not generally by favoring industries. More directly, the IRA and the CHIPS Act provide specific incentives for EVs, semiconductors, rare earths, alternative energy sources and others. There are two reasons we should develop an industrial policy: 1) specifically to safeguard our national security and 2) to counter unfair economic competition, particularly where our national security is directly concerned. For example, making bicycles would not be part of the second example. But China, using subsidies and its economic muscle to dominate batteries, rare earths, semiconductors or EVs, could eventually imperil national security by disrupting our access to these products and materials. We cannot cede these important resources and capabilities to another country.\n\nCrafting an industrial policy should be done properly and with a tightly restricted scope. If the policy is politically motivated, it will be used to benefit various political benefactors and eventually provoke extreme misallocation of capital and corruption. Managing the economy is extremely complex, and Adam Smith's invisible hand still prevails - in a way we can never understand. If the government starts to micromanage through an industrial policy, it will not stop, and much of the e/fficiencies meant to be created will not be realized. Industrial policy should come with twins - very strict limitations on political interference and related comprehensive policy around factors like permitting requirements, which if not drastically improved will inhibit our ability to make investments and allow infrastructure to be built.",

        "page_content": "## Third, fixing income inequality will reignite the American dream.\n\nOf all the policy errors we need to remedy in America, there are two that I believe will have a dramatic e/ffect on growth and equality - and go a long way toward repairing the frayed American dream. The first is providing graduating students and other individuals with work skills (in fields such as advanced manufacturing, cyber, data science and technology, healthcare and so on) that will lead to better paying jobs. This would be good for growth and much that ails us. And we know what to do. High schools and community colleges should work with local businesses to create specific skillstraining programs, internships and apprenticeships that prepare graduating students to be job ready whether they go on to earn a credential, to work or to attend college. With 10.8 million job openings and 5.9 million unemployed workers in the United States, work-skills training has never been needed more. Businesses must be involved in this process, and programs need to be o/ffered locally because that is where the actual jobs are.\n\nThe second step is related to the first: Get more income to lower-paid workers. The gap between skilled and unskilled workers has been growing dramatically - so much so that unskilled labor has become less and less a 'living wage.' Of the 150 million Americans working today, approximately 21 million are paid less than $15 per hour. It is hard to live on $15 an hour, particularly for families (even if two household members are working). But all jobs should be treated with respect. Jobs and living wages bring dignity, lead to more opportunity - in housing, education, childcare, health and overall well-being - and also help rebuild communities as that income is used to improve how people live.\n\nA major step would be to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which many Democrats and Republicans already agree upon. Today, the EITC supplements low- to moderate-income working individuals and couples, particularly with children. For example, a single mother with two children earning $9 an hour (approximately $20,000 a year) could receive a tax credit of more than $6,000 at year's end. Workers without children receive a very small tax credit - this should be dramatically expanded, too - and personally, I would eliminate the child requirement altogether. Last year, the EITC program cost the United States about $64 billion, and 31 million individuals received the credit. We should convert the EITC to make it more like a negative income payroll tax, paid monthly. Many people who are eligible for this benefit do not get it (often because they do not know about it). Proper reform of this program could increase benefits where deserved and reduce fraudulent and improper payments. Any tax credit income should not be o/ffset by any other benefits these individuals already receive.\n\nI have little doubt that this would do more than anything else to lift up lower-income neighborhoods as the money is spent on lifting up their families. I also have little doubt that this would add to GDP - because most of this money would, in fact, be spent.\n\n## Fourth, America must take the lead on devising a comprehensive global economic strategy.\n\nIn an op-ed published by The Wall Street Journal earlier this year, I wrote: 'Only America has the full capability to lead and coalesce the Western world, though we must do so respectfully and in partnership with our allies. Without cohesiveness and unity with our allies, autocratic forces will divide and conquer the bickering West. America needs to lead with its strengths-not only military but also economic, diplomatic and moral .'",

A comprehensive economic strategy would tighten the bonds, strengthen our alliances and, importantly, maximize our economic resources. Furthermore, it must encompass a global trade and investment strategy, a holistic plan around energy security and food security, and far more dynamic development finance for emerging markets. Done properly, the economic strength to emerge from such collaboration will preserve our alliances, entice\n\nnations such as India into the fold, guarantee the strength of the U.S. military and preserve the mighty U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency.\n\nFinally, more active diplomacy and more dynamic communication around the principles that motivate the Western world are required. These principles are life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and the idea that all people are created equal. Democracy and human freedom are inseparable from freedom of speech, freedom of religion and free enterprise. We should loudly and proudly sing these values from the rooftops.\n\n## In Closing\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude and appreciation for the 290,000+ employees, and their families, of JPMorgan Chase. From this letter, I hope shareholders and all readers gain an appreciation for the tremendous character and capabilities of our people and how they continue to help communities around the world. They have faced these times of adversity with grace and fortitude.

Not only are our seasoned branches delivering value to our customers, communities and shareholders, but the investment in new branches is a key driver to market share gains over time. Our model's success gives us confidence to continue to invest in new branches in high-opportunity markets where we still have significant untapped opportunity.\n\nBeyond our investments in the branch network, we continue to scale and improve products that meet the distinct needs of customers across segments. Last year, we enhanced our cash flow management solutions. We launched early direct deposit for our Secure Banking SM customers, which allows them to access their paychecks up to two days early, and we enhanced Chase Overdraft Assist SM to provide an extra day before charging an overdraft fee.\n\nIt's part of our job to make it easy for customers to have more of their banking relationship with us. We're continuing",

We made it simpler to open a checking account, introduced more convenient methods to pay and get paid, and created a streamlined digital lending experience for faster access to capital when customers need it. We take pride in helping entrepreneurs go from idea to IPO and beyond.\n\nFor our Wealth Management clients, we're growing our advisor base and developing products and capabilities to serve clients across the wealth continuum. In 2022, we added more than 300 advisors on our path to 6,000, launched new products such as Wealth Plan and Personal Advisors, and continued to make enhancements to Self-Directed Investing. Our goal is to achieve $1 trillion in assets over the next several years, and we're on track to do so.\n\n## Payments, lending, commerce\n\nWe continue to be the #1 credit card issuer in the United States for both spend and lend, crossing $1 trillion in sales volume in 2022. It is our marketing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#1\n\n#1 digital banking platform in the United States 6\n\nengine that fuels distribution and scale. Marketing is to Card what bankers, branches and advisors are to banking: baseline distribution. Our strategy is working. In 2022, we drove a 20% yearover-year increase in new accounts within our risk appetite. This drove our share of outstandings to 17.3%, up nearly 75 basis points - healthy progress toward our goal of 20% lend share over the long term.\n\nA large part of our Card strategy is to get the right products into customers' hands. Over the last three years, we refreshed our entire branded card portfolio to ensure our cards' value propositions were best-in-class and set up to perform well. We also renewed valuable relationships with our co-brand partners that cover the vast majority of co-brand spend share to at least 2027. Beyond consumer cards, we're making progress on the opportunity with business customers, launching Ink Business Premier SM in the second half of 2022. While it's early days, the new card has been well-received, attracting higherrevenue small businesses that spend multiples above the average.\n\nPayments remain a center of gravity for financial relationships. We are a leading payments franchise in the United States, enabling our customers to move more than $5.6 trillion in 2022 across payment methods.\n\nTo extend that leadership position, we're also investing in our Commerce business. The strategy here is straightforward: Lean into what our customers do on our cards all the time - spend on travel, dining and shopping - and invest in digital experiences for Chase to win in discovery, booking, paying and borrowing across these journeys. With our recent acquisitions of cxLoyalty, FROSCH, Figg and The Infatuation, we now own di/fferentiated assets and experiences in travel, o/ffers and dining. We're leveraging our new assets and talent to build out our two-sided platform, connecting customers and merchants as only a company with our scale and digitally engaged customer base can.\n\nOur e/fforts produced meaningful results in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7  Chase Travel : Our travel business delivered ~$8 billion in volume booked in 2022\n- \u00b7  Chase O/ffers : We drove over $6 billion in spend to merchants who used our o/ffers platform\n- \u00b7  My Chase Plan\u00ae : Two years post-launch, we've opened more than 7 million plans\n\nThe Connected Commerce business is driving impact for Chase by improving satisfaction, stimulating engagement and creating capital-light, recurring revenue streams, all while making the core franchise more resilient long term. As we told you at Investor Day last year, we expect to drive more than $30 billion in volume through our Commerce platforms in the next few years.\n\n## Omnichannel engagement\n\nEarning the right to be the primary financial partner for consumers and small businesses requires us to build trust by delivering experiences our customers expect - in both major and everyday moments. The completeness of our product set can serve all of our customers' banking, lending and investing needs.",

Although we're proud of this, we are never satisfied and recognize there's always more to do for our customers. We prioritize improving activities our customers do most often in their everyday lives, such as opening an account, replacing a card and making a payment. We also help them with major life milestones, like planning for their future through goals-based plans or searching for and buying a car or a home.\n\nA key part of our engagement strategy is ensuring we reach historically underserved populations. We continue to make meaningful strides in our community strategy in support of our $30 billion racial equity commitment announced in October 2020. Since then, we have:\n\n- \u00b7  Opened 13 Community Center branches in minority neighborhoods and hired over 140 Community Managers\n- \u00b7  Conducted over 9,000 financial health sessions with more than 190,000 attendees\n- \u00b7  Hired ~160 Community Home Lending Advisors and expanded our homebuyer grant program to more than 10,000 minority neighborhoods nationwide\n- \u00b7  Provided complimentary one-on-one coaching to nearly 3,000 small businesses through dedicated consultants in 21 U.S. cities and launched a national special purpose credit program to improve access to credit for small business owners in historically underserved areas\n\n## PROTECTING OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE FIRM THROUGH A STRONG RISK AND CONTROLS ENVIRONMENT\n\nEveryone's top priority in CCB is to protect our customers and the firm. Having the proper governance and processes in place ensures our business is sustainable and resilient and meets regulatory requirements. Coupled with our fortress balance sheet, this strength attracts a strong, diversified customer base that has confidence in the safety and security of banking with Chase.\n\nThrough data and analytics, we continue to enhance our risk management capabilities across CCB. Keeping our credit appetite constant, machine learning is helping us surgically extend more credit to more consumers and small businesses. While fraud is everywhere, we are improving our ability to protect customers earlier and more often. Education plays a big role, too. Bankers, Community Managers and marketing work together to help customers build healthy financial habits and avoid becoming victims of fraud.\n\n## CULTIVATING TALENT TO BUILD HIGH-PERFORMING, DIVERSE TEAMS WHERE CULTURE IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE\n\nOur people continue to be our greatest asset. We attract the best talent from all backgrounds who choose to work at Chase because of the impact we have on our customers and communities and the opportunity to grow their career. We strive to create a culture where everyone's voice matters, leading to the best business outcomes.\n\nOur employees embrace the full spectrum of career opportunities that Chase o/ffers - across lines of business, functions and roles. They grow with us and move across our businesses to develop unique perspectives that help us solve the most important and complicated issues across the firm.\n\nOur people work hard every day - with heart and humanity - to better serve our customers, communities and each other.\n\n## IN CONCLUSION\n\nWe're tremendously confident about the future of our franchise, yet we approach our opportunities and challenges with great humility. We wouldn't trade our hand with anyone's. Our scale, distribution, brand, products and people position us well to continue to achieve best-inclass performance for decades to come.\n\nMarianne Lake\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCo-CEO, Consumer & Community Banking\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJennifer Piepszak\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCo-CEO, Consumer & Community Banking",

        "page_content": "## Corporate & Investment Bank\n\n2022 was a watershed year for financial markets.\n\nTasked with taming inflation and cooling an overheating economy, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times in 2022 to levels not seen in nearly 15 years.\n\nThe end of near-zero interest rates meant that many young, emerging companies needed to focus on profitability rather than revenue growth at any cost. Higher rates also dented investors' confidence and tested their patience in assets such as special purpose acquisition companies and cryptocurrencies, which benefited so much from excess capital just a year ago.\n\nGeopolitics dominated headlines and moved markets. In February, Russia invaded Ukraine, fomenting a humanitarian crisis that worsens even now. The war disrupted supply chains and forced countries to rethink their entire approach to sourcing energy, food and other critical resources, with every issue now being viewed through the lens of national security.\n\n## BENEFITS OF BUSINESS DIVERSITY\n\nIn recent shareholder letters, I've stressed the key pillars of a strategy we set years ago: to be global, diversified, complete and at scale. That strategy has served us well and continues to serve us well across the Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) and our wholesale businesses. We and our clients benefit from our strong, balanced business during volatile times and market dislocations, including those we have witnessed in the last few months.\n\nThe CIB generated $15 billion in net income on revenue of $48 billion in 2022, a solid performance following record net income and revenue in 2021.\n\nIndustrywide investment banking fees fell 42% from the prior year 1 , and J.P. Morgan's fees followed suit, down 48% from 2021. This was not unexpected. Industrywide investment banking fees have averaged about $80 billion per year from 2015 to 2020 1 so 2022 was a lighter-than-average year, more comparable with the pre-pandemic years of 2018 and 2019. Even so, we finished the year #1 in investment banking fees, #1 in equity capital markets, #1 in debt capital markets and #2 in mergers and acquisitions 1 .\n\nIn 2022, our M&A franchise advised on over 350 deals that totaled more than $900 billion, including some of the year's biggest deals, notably in the healthcare industry for Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.\n\nWith declining M&A activity and higher rates slowing refinancings, our debt underwriting fees declined 43% yearover-year in 2022. More positively, we're proud of the discipline we kept in underwriting, particularly in our leveraged finance business. This puts us in prime position to help companies when activity picks up.\n\nEquity capital markets also saw a dramatic drop-o/ff in deal activity during the year. Volatile and uncertain markets nearly shut down the IPO market, although J.P. Morgan did help lead two of the year's most notable deals: AIG's\n\n- 1 Dealogic as of January 2, 2023.\n\n$1.7 billion IPO of Corebridge, its retirement solutions and life insurance business, and Volkswagen's \u20ac9.4 billion IPO of Porsche.\n\nMeanwhile, we have continued to scale up our regional investment banking capabilities across the United States. Working with the Commercial Bank, we are deepening relationships with middle market sponsors and aligning coverage teams to support growth industries, particularly technology, healthcare and the green economy.\n\nOur Markets business continues to be the top-ranked franchise in the world by revenue 2 . The business outperformed even our own expectations in 2022, generating revenue of $29 billion, just short of 2020's record highs, as volatility persisted.\n\nInterest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions had investors repositioning portfolios, driving Fixed Income revenue higher, particularly in our Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates trading businesses. Overall, we reported $18.6 billion in Fixed Income revenue, up 10% from the previous year, and retained our top wallet share 2 . Equities revenue came in at $10.4 billion. Underscoring the strides we've made in Equities, the business has grown revenue by more than 80% since 2017, and market share has increased by almost 300 basis points over the same period 2 . Another notable success in 2022 was our Global Research team's top ranking across all three of Institutional Investor 's annual global surveys.",

While this increase has been a headwind, our business has been disciplined in deploying capital and continues to deliver strong returns. With the strategic initiatives we have in place, we're confident in our strategy as market structure evolves.\n\nOur Securities Services business, which provides essential post-trade services to our institutional asset-manager and asset-owner clients, also had a strong year, reporting record revenue of $4.5 billion.\n\nInvestment over the years has allowed us to steadily grow revenue and market share in Securities Services 2 while maintaining a top-tier operating margin.\n\nThe scale of our business is remarkable. We provide safekeeping, settlement and services for securities in approximately 100 markets around the world, and at the end of 2022, assets under custody 3 exceeded $28 trillion.\n\nTurning to Payments, the business saw strong growth in 2022, generating firmwide revenue of nearly $14 billion, $4 billion more than in 2021, due in large part to the e/ffect of higher rates 4 . Payments revenue generated from the CIB alone increased 33% from the previous year 4 .\n\n## INVESTMENT BANKING\n\n## Global Investment Banking wallet evolution and J.P. Morgan rankings\n\n($ in billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Dealogic as of January 2, 2023\n\nServing more than 30,000 clients across the CIB and Commercial Banking and approximately 300,000 small- and medium-sized enterprises in the United States and Canada, the business continued to win new mandates and deepen relationships with the world's largest and most sophisticated companies. Over the last five years, the CIB's new mandates revenue more than doubled for both corporate and financial institution clients.\n\n## INNOVATION, TALENT AND INVESTMENT\n\nI am very proud of our people, our results and the vital role our business plays in supporting global economies and commerce and in maintaining liquid, orderly markets. That role is amplified by the close collaboration across our businesses, which has allowed us to grow and invest while still maintaining strong returns for our shareholders. Innovation and investment are critical as we work to meet clients' evolving needs, as the competition intensifies and as we look to capitalize on several exciting opportunities.\n\n## Capital for the climate\n\nClimate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our age. With the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act and the need for solutions to Europe's energy challenges, a major opportunity exists in committing capital and expertise to help clients transition to the low-carbon economy. In 2022, the CIB facilitated $164 billion in transactions (toward the firmwide target of $2.5 trillion by the end of 2030) to further sustainable development, including $1 trillion to support green initiatives. This predominantly consisted of leading or participating in environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related bond issuances, providing derivative hedging and advising on M&A deals.\n\nMoving forward, we plan to deepen our coverage of clients engaged in the green economy and low-carbon transition, create new products and allocate capital to finance ESG objectives. We will also build on the success of our two centers of excellence: the Center for Carbon Transition and ESG Solutions, a specialist team of investment bankers who provide ESG-related advice and transaction support.",

In 2022, we were involved in nearly 60 deals, raising $12 billion in proceeds. We also launched our Capital Connect platform, which reinvented the traditional private capital raise, seamlessly connecting investors with earlier-stage companies. Helping a client at an early stage can result in a client-for-life relationship, leading to opportunities in global corporate and private banking and potentially an IPO or sell-side M&A mandate.\n\nPrivate debt markets have also grown significantly in the last five years and at a much faster pace than the syndicated lending market 5 . To compete, we have set up a new direct lending initiative that has already funded dozens of deals, helping to deepen relationships, especially with middle market clients.\n\n## The halo e/ffect in trading\n\nIn trading, we believe that being complete continues to o/ffer huge advantages. Providing a complete set of trading products creates a halo e/ffect, making it more attractive for clients to trade with us across the full range of our products. Our diversification also provides balance to our revenue regardless of the macroeconomic environment. For example, in 2021, equities outperformed while in 2022, fixed income macro businesses were the main growth engines.\n\nWe are also committed to providing a seamless and di/fferentiated experience across the trade life cycle - from pretrade through to execution to post-trade. For pre-trade, we are the clear leader in research, o/ffering analysis on more than 5,200 companies and around 80 economies worldwide. With so much content, our focus has been on improving the client experience, ensuring we're delivering relevant, timely reports in the most accessible and digestible formats. For post-trade, our Securities Services business o/ffers\n\ncomprehensive middle- and back-o/ffice services to complete the full trade life cycle experience for our clients.\n\nFinally, we want to capitalize on secular growth trends in the industry. For instance, over the last five years, the industry wallet with large institutional clients has grown more than with other financial institutions. Increasingly, these large clients need banks with size, scale and solutions to manage complex portfolios. Being a reliable, complete counterparty, our market share with this particular group of clients has grown more than 350 basis points over the past five years 6 .\n\nAll of our clients continue to embrace electronic trading. Through the years, we've invested heavily in our electronic trading capabilities, both in areas that have been at the forefront of electronification, such as equities and foreign exchange, and in those where the industry has been slower to embrace the trend, such as credit.\n\n## Growth opportunities in data services\n\nIn Securities Services, the rising complexity of funds is creating opportunities as we continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of our clients. As a result, we have been modernizing our core custody and fund accounting infrastructure to create scale and e/fficiency.\n\nWe are also investing to expand our capabilities in areas like exchange-traded fund (ETF) servicing, middle-o/ffice outsourcing and alternatives - all of which are growth areas for our business.\n\nLooking ahead, clients will increasingly turn to service providers for help in managing their data. Anticipating this development, we launched our Fusion platform in 2022, and we're already building strong brand recognition in the market. Providing seamless and e/fficient solutions for discovering, managing and analyzing data will unlock new opportunities to deliver value to our investor clients.",

From peer-to-peer blockchain connections to JPM Coin, programmable money and digitization of assets, we're seeking to make sending, managing and receiving money easier, faster and more secure.\n\nConnections with other parts of our firm, including Investment Banking, Commercial Banking, Markets and Retail Banking, are opening opportunities for Payments, especially with the 5.8 million small businesses that already bank with Chase. As the only bank with end-to-end in-house acquiring and treasury capabilities, we have created an ecosystem that provides merchants with everything from smart terminals and tap-on-phone solutions to consumer trends and insights drawn from issuing and acquiring data.\n\nAnother big opportunity exists in developing data and software-as-aservice solutions for platform businesses and industry verticals such as healthcare and connected cars. For example, in U.S. healthcare, InstaMed, which we acquired in 2019, digitizes interactions between patient, payers and providers, seamlessly processing payments and moving healthcare data. Now connected to approximately 60% of U.S. healthcare providers, it has created an extensive network for our clients. Similar opportunities exist in the fast-changing mobility industry, impacting not only the automotive sector but energy, utilities and commerce. Through our partnership with Volkswagen Financial Services and majority stake in Volkswagen Pay, we are exploring a future in which cars will be used as smart payment devices and commerce platforms.\n\nIn this and many other areas, our accelerated investments over the past few years are helping to future-proof our business. As we compete with banks and fintechs, we have the best of both: scale, end-to-end capabilities and direct relationships with clients of all sizes.\n\n## WELL-POSITIONED FOR THE FUTURE\n\nGlobal markets have already encountered significant challenges in the new year from interest rate volatility to market and geopolitical uncertainty.\n\nAnd with central banks tightening in ways we haven't seen before as they wrestle with ongoing inflationary pressures, market uncertainty is likely to persist and weigh on growth in the United States and other developed economies in 2023.\n\nMore positively, we are well-positioned to help clients in any environment. Our scale, completeness and culture of collaboration are key di/fferentiators as clients increasingly look to us for solutions that straddle di/fferent business lines.\n\nI am incredibly proud of how our employees supported clients in 2022. Our performance and the opportunities ahead show what an amazing hand our business has - and give me immense confidence and hope for the future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDaniel E.

The unprecedented speed of this reset caused significant market dislocations, with higher discount rates leading to severe asset repricing. For the first time in more than 50 years, both stock and bond markets had negative returns, calling into question the diversification principles of asset allocation.\n\nThrough it all, J.P. Morgan Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) drew upon its two centuries of experience navigating global markets and providing forward-looking insights to ensure that our clients had the planning and investment advice they needed to sustain a long-term perspective. Our relentless focus on risk management\n\n90%\n\n## INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE\n\n2022 % of J.P.

In 2022, these principles were reinforced, as actively managed portfolios - an area in which J.P. Morgan has long excelled proved their value in delivering strong returns for clients.\n\nAWM has one of the industry's largest internal research budgets and employs more than 1,100 investment professionals who cover over 2,500 companies, spanning every asset class and major geography. These individuals methodically travel around the world to uncover compelling investment opportunities for our clients; last year alone, they held over 5,000 meetings with companies and management teams.\n\nOur durable approach helped us deliver strong investment performance amid the historic levels of volatility in 2022, particularly in our Fixed Income and Equity platforms, outpacing most of our largest peers, especially those with more passive approaches to investing assets. In fact, across the three-, five- and 10-year time horizons, our investment performance in those asset classes has never been stronger. Our long-term mutual fund assets under management (AUM) outperforming the peer median over 10 years increased from a strong 86% in 2021 to an even better 90% in 2022.\n\nClients rewarded our consistent and strong outperformance by entrusting us with even more of their assets. AWM not only achieved its 19 th consecutive year of net new inflows, but we also ranked in the top three of public peers for net client inflows over the past five years.\n\n## FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS\n\nWith delivering superior investment performance as our guiding principle, our revenue grew by 5% to reach a record level. Our results were strong across regions and channels and benefited from our fortress balance sheet, the Global Private Bank's (GPB) robust deposit",

With a healthy pre-tax margin of 33% that is among the industry's highest, AWM has continued to deliver operating leverage to our shareholders over the past five years.\n\n## INVESTING IN THE FUTURE OF OUR FRANCHISE\n\nOne of our most significant investments has been in our e/ffort to increase our roster of high-quality GPB advisors.

Morgan to advise on rebuilding, financial stabilization, sovereign credit ratings and economic ties to Europe.

As a fiduciary, we constantly stress test portfolios to prepare clients for those scenarios. Recent events in 2023's first quarter have reminded us of those risks. Today's financial system is stronger than any time before, and it will emerge even more resilient as we apply lessons learned to the future. As tough as 2022 was on markets, the good news is the starting point for the next 10 to 15 years of future return assumptions has increased nearly 70%, from 4.3% last year to 7.2% 8 .\n\nI am so proud of the breadth and consistency of our success in delivering value to our clients and shareholders. We remain relentlessly focused on being the advisor of choice to the world's most prominent institutions, pension funds, central banks, individuals and families. Our commitment to doing first-class business in a first-class way for these clients is what makes AWM a special gem inside JPMorgan Chase.\n\nI also take great pride in how we helped clients and our shareholders navigate the challenges of 2022 and across past market cycles, and I am optimistic about the opportunities ahead and our role in helping to deliver the best possible outcomes for all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMary Callahan Erdoes CEO, Asset & Wealth Management",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Responsibility\n\nCorporate Responsibility at JPMorgan Chase takes a robust, holistic approach to driving inclusive economic growth in communities around the world. Combining our philanthropy, research, policy recommendations and advocacy, while working with leaders at every level of government and business, we advance strategies to help move the needle on significant challenges a/ffecting the communities we serve, from closing the racial wealth gap and tackling the skilled labor shortage to making the economy and communities more resilient.\n\nAt the core of our integrated model is a focus on outcomes. Bringing together our resources - including our expertise and community network - we work to generate solutions that benefit customers, communities and the economy at large. We see this in how JPMorgan Chase develops banking products, supports clients and communities, and powers the economy.\n\nPromoting financial health. Far too many people lack access to the products and services they need to improve their financial health, including checking and savings accounts. To help close America's wealth gap, we looked to consumer data, social entrepreneurs and our long-standing community partners for insights, which influenced the design of products like Chase Secure Banking SM , an a/ffordable and safe account option serving nearly 1.5 million customers, and Autosave, a tool used by 1.9 million consumers to simplify and automate savings. With nonprofits like the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund, we helped establish national standards for products similar to Secure Banking so more people can access low-cost banking services. And with Autosave, we leveraged insights from the JPMorgan Chase Institute\n\nand collaborated with consumer advocates and community leaders to understand the most e/ffective strategies to help even more customers meet their savings goals and set aside money for unexpected expenses like car repairs or medical bills.\n\nIncreasing access to economic opportunity. We believe that when communities thrive, businesses thrive. In Seine-SaintDenis (SSD), just outside of Paris where 30% of young people live in poverty, we are putting our model to work to help spur economic growth. Nearly five years ago, we made a $30 million philanthropic commitment to support communities in Greater Paris, particularly in SSD. We started by collaborating with government agencies and nonprofits on skills training and small business growth, assessing and updating our strategy along the way. This e/ffort reached people like Fatou, an entrepreneur who, with the assistance of our nonprofit partner Adie, learned how to win public and private contracts for her security company. She was able to get her business o/ff the ground and grow her client network. Fatou is one of more than 6,700 entrepreneurs and 600 local businesses who have received such support in addition to the 23,000 SSD residents who have received necessary skills training to advance their careers. We are continuing to learn from the outcomes of our work in Greater Paris, coordinating closely with local policymakers and organizations as we plan to enhance our commitment going forward.\n\n## Supporting global growth and security.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has upended millions of lives and created a significant shortage of energy supplies. Over the past year, we have worked closely with leaders across our company, clients and policymakers to navigate these unprecedented social, economic and energy security challenges.\n\nOnce again, we are taking a comprehensive approach, informing business decisions to advance energy security and scale clean technology solutions while providing $10 million in philanthropic capital to address critical humanitarian needs and help launch career training and upskilling programs for Ukrainian refugees in Poland. And we are thinking toward the future, advising the Ukrainian government on its plan for a postwar recovery. This is a pivotal moment for the global economy, and we will continue to leverage our wide range of expertise and insights to navigate complex global dynamics.\n\n## Generating impact is a business impera-\n\ntive. Improving our products, strengthening communities, and supporting a more inclusive and secure global economy are inextricably tied to the success of our company. Even as we seek to manage uncertainty and market distress to promote a sound financial system, it remains the responsibility of both the public and private sectors to come together to identify solutions that will lead to greater prosperity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDemetrios Marantis\n\nGlobal Head of Corporate Responsibility",

        "page_content": "In Corporate Responsibility, we aim to help strengthen the global financial system by supporting economic opportunity that is equitable and accessible.\n\nWe help identify solutions to major global challenges thanks to the investments we've made to build a strong and sustainable company.\n\nEvery day, we apply what we've learned from supporting our customers and clients to help build more resilient communities. This approach allows us to focus on the ingredients essential for inclusive growth: jobs and skills training, small business growth, community development and financial health.\n\nHere are some ways we bring the full force of the firm - combining our business resources, community and government engagement, philanthropic capital, data and expertise - to promote a stronger, more inclusive economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safeguarding sound financial systems\n\nThe global economy is only as resilient as its financial systems. Around the world, we're working with policy groups, trade associations and regulators so we can extend loans, make capital investments and provide services that help people access more opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, we joined the O/ffice of the Comptroller of the Currency's launch of Project REACh (Roundtable for Economic Access and Change), formed to identify and reduce barriers to full and fair participation in the United States' banking system and economy. We were the first major financial institution to launch an\n\ninitiative to provide credit to customers with no credit history, and we have now approved credit cards for roughly 15,000 new-to-credit customers. This helps people to build credit scores and access lower-priced mainstream credit products, which could eventually include a mortgage - one of America's most important sources of generational wealth.\n\n## Accelerating climate and sustainability solutions\n\nAcross our company, we are taking measures to respond to the climate challenge against the backdrop of a global energy crisis. In December, we issued our Climate Report outlining how we are scaling green solutions to support our clients' business goals, investing in new clean energy technology that creates local economic growth and jobs, meeting immediate energy needs, and minimizing our operational impact. In 2022, we financed and facilitated $197 billion toward our $2.5 trillion Sustainable Development Target: $70 billion toward green, $87 billion toward development finance and $40 billion toward community development. Through 2022, we have financed and facilitated $482 billion toward this overall target, including $176 billion toward our $1 trillion green target.\n\nWe also announced 2030 emissions intensity reduction targets for three new key sectors: iron and steel, cement and aviation. The aggregate of these new sectors, along with the sectors we announced in 2021, accounts for the majority of global emissions across both the supply and demand sides in the global energy system - a key consideration for advancing overall decarbonization and the global path to net-zero emissions.\n\nWe recognize that climate change has a domino e/ffect on communities, with extreme weather impacting roughly one in 10 homes in the United States. In response, we're supporting programs\n\nthat aim to scale climate-resilient a/ffordable housing models, particularly in Black, Hispanic and Latino communities, including in rural areas. Our most recent $15 million philanthropic commitment will help produce or preserve more than 1,400 units of a/ffordable housing, incorporating energy-e/fficient features and weatherization upgrades that o/ffer protection against extreme weather and reduce utility costs.\n\n## Driving inclusive economic growth\n\nInvesting in the careers of tomorrow\n\nAs rapid changes in technology, automation and artificial intelligence alter career paths, it is imperative for companies like ours to transform how we prepare people to compete for well-paying jobs. Since 2018, we've supported the Dallas County Promise, a program helping Dallas County Public School students access postsecondary education opportunities at local colleges and universities. Today, more than 90,000 high school seniors in the Dallas area have benefited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis model is being scaled across the state, with the potential to serve 5% of the nation's high school seniors. It is even influencing legislation to help districts prepare students for college and encourage high schoolers to apply for federal financial aid before they graduate. Supporting this impactful program is part of our five-year, $350 million commitment to equip people with the skills they need for the future of work and to meet the growing demand for qualified workers.",

        "page_content": "## Supporting small business growth\n\nSmall businesses generate jobs and are vital to driving local economic growth. In the past year, we have assisted more than 26,500 small businesses around the world, helping them create or retain more than 54,000 jobs and increase revenue by over $129 million. Our employees have been central to this e/ffort, committing 7,000+ volunteer hours globally through our Founders Forward small business mentorship program. The program pairs entrepreneurs with JPMorgan Chase team members to receive consultative support on various business challenges, covering leadership, financial modeling, e-commerce, marketing and more.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also help entrepreneurs succeed through our support of Ascend, a nationwide program focused on developing customized growth strategies for small businesses. Eighty-nine percent of participating businesses are owned by people of color, and this year these businesses surpassed $2 billion in contracts. As a result of Ascend's specialized approach, participating entrepreneurs are able to focus on trainings most relevant to them. In New York City, for example, Salsa Hospitality CEO Daniel Garcia learned how to grow his executive team, plan for long-term business expansion and purchase a new facility to accommodate business growth, ultimately increasing sales by 56% in 2022.\n\n## Catalyzing community development\n\nEconomic opportunity is deeply rooted in neighborhoods. We saw this firsthand in Syracuse, New York, where a declining manufacturing sector contributed to an economic downturn, job loss and population decrease. As one of the inaugural winners of our annual Advancing Cities Challenge, a yearly competition that promotes community-driven solutions to advance local inclusive growth, we provided $3 million over three years and ongoing coaching to help drive technological development in the city's workforce, neighborhoods and small businesses and to boost its economy.\n\nWith our support, the city of Syracuse piloted and evolved its Community Investment Framework, ultimately attracting significant public and private sector investments. According to the city, these investments are creating nearly 50,000 jobs, generating almost $600 million in annual tax revenue for New York state and spurring an additional $500 million in public and private sector funding that will help scale opportunities and create economic growth for residents in Syracuse's underserved communities.\n\n## Promoting financial health and wealth creation\n\nPolicies, programs and products aimed at improving financial health are key to creating more inclusive economies. Through our support of innovative, inclusive fintech accelerators - the Financial Inclusion Lab, the Financial Solutions Lab and the Catalyst Fund - we are helping advance the financial well-being of underserved low- and middle-income populations. The Labs provide capital, mentorship and additional assistance to create scalable fintech solutions that enable communities to build wealth, save money and reduce debt.\n\nIn India, the Financial Inclusion Lab has supported 50 early-stage startups, serving more than 30 million consumers who need access to savings, credit and\n\ninsurance services and raising over $80 million in follow-up funding to continue their work. In the United States, Financial Solutions Lab participants have helped more than 33 million consumers. And in emerging markets like Nigeria, the Catalyst Fund has supported 61 startups, helping more than 14 million customers build savings, learn to invest and more easily access credit.\n\n## Extending support in times of crisis\n\nWe show up for the communities we serve in both good and tough times. Over the last three years, we've contributed more than $33 million for disaster relief through corporate donations and employee personal donations. We've provided support to communities through hardships of all kinds, from catastrophic earthquakes in Haiti, T\u00fcrkiye and Syria to the cost-of-living crisis in the United Kingdom and tragic violence in neighborhoods spanning the United States.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBut in many cases, impacted communities need more than financial support. When Jackson, Mississippi, a city with more than 140,000 residents, experienced periodic water shutdowns and boil orders due to burst pipes and high lead levels, our team worked closely with community organizations responding to the crisis, hosting a local training for nonprofits working on recovery plans while also distributing resources like bottled water. This is just one example of how we're bringing our expertise and resources to Mississippi as our business in the state continues to grow.",

Net interest income excluding Markets was $62.4 billion, up 40%.\n\n- -Noninterest revenue of $62.0 billion, down 11%, driven by lower Investment Banking fees, $2.4 billion of net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower net production revenue in Home Lending and lower auto operating lease income, largely offset by higher CIB Markets revenue and a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa Class B common shares ('Visa B shares') in Corporate.\n- \u00b7 Noninterest expense was $76.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural expense and continued investments in the business, including compensation, technology and marketing, partially offset by lower volume- and revenuerelated expense.\n- \u00b7 The provision for credit losses was $6.4 billion, reflecting:\n- - a net addition of $3.5 billion to the allowance for credit losses, consisting of $2.3 billion in wholesale and $1.2 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and\n- - $2.9 billion of net charge-offs.\n\nThe prior year provision was a net benefit of $9.3 billion, reflecting a net reduction to the allowance for credit losses of $12.1 billion.\n\n- \u00b7 The total allowance for credit losses was $22.2 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.81%, compared with 1.62% in the prior year.\n- \u00b7 The Firm's nonperforming assets totaled $7.2 billion at December 31, 2022, a net decrease of $1.1 billion, predominantly driven by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales.\n- \u00b7 Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans across the LOBs.\n- \u00b7 Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up 5%, reflecting:\n- -growth in CCB from existing and new accounts, and net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by the impact of growth in customer spending in CCB and migration into investments in AWM, and\n- - reductions in CIB and CB due to attrition driven by the rising interest rate environment.\n\n## Selected capital and other metrics\n\n- \u00b7 CET1 capital was $219 billion, and the Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.2% and 13.6%, respectively.\n- \u00b7 SLR was 5.6%.\n- \u00b7 TBVPS grew by 2%, ending 2022 at $73.12.",

The Firm has taken and continues to take steps to close positions and reduce certain of its business activities and exposures connected with the war, and to assist clients with fulfilling any pre-existing obligations and managing their Russia-related risks.\n\nThe Firm's exposure to Russia and Russia-associated clients and counterparties is not material to its financial condition or results of operations. However, the Firm continues to monitor potential secondary impacts of the war, including increased market volatility, inflationary pressures and the effects of financial and economic sanctions imposed by various governments, that could have adverse effects on the Firm's businesses.\n\nThe Firm also continues to monitor and manage the operational risks associated with the war, including compliance with the financial and economic sanctions and the increased risk of cyber attacks.\n\nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 116-126, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129, Market Risk Management on pages 131-138, Country Risk Management on pages 139-140 and Operational Risk Management on pages 142-144 for additional information.\n\nFor purposes of this Form 10-K, 'Russia' refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm for which the largest proportion of their assets is located, or the largest proportion of their revenue is derived, in Russia, based on the Firm's internal country risk management framework; and 'Russia-associated' refers to exposure to clients and counterparties of the Firm with respect to which economic or financial sanctions relating to the war in Ukraine have been imposed or which have close association with Russia.\n\n## Interbank Offered Rate ('IBOR') transition\n\nThe Firm and other market participants are preparing for the final stages of the transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') and other IBORs in accordance with the International Organization of Securities Commission's standards for transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of the publication of the remaining principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, onemonth, three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) ('LIBOR Cessation') is scheduled for June 30, 2023.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm had significantly reduced the notional amount of its exposure to contracts that reference U.S. dollar LIBOR, including in derivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans, securities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, and is on-track to meet both its internal milestones for contract remediation as well as the industry milestones and recommendations published by National Working Groups, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the U.S. The Firm also continues to engage with clients to assist them with transitioning their U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts to replacement rates in anticipation of LIBOR Cessation. The majority of the Firm's remaining LIBOR exposure is to derivative contracts. The Firm will be participating in initiatives by the principal central counterparties ('CCPs') to convert cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023 which will remediate approximately 40% of the Firm's remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR derivatives exposure. The Firm expects that the majority of the remaining derivatives exposure will be remediated predominantly through contractual fallback provisions.\n\nOn March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act ('LIBOR Act') was signed into law in the U.S. The LIBOR Act provides a framework for replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR as the reference rate in legacy financial contracts that may not otherwise transition to a replacement rate upon LIBOR Cessation. In addition, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that the administrator of LIBOR be required to continue to publish the one-month, three-month and sixmonth tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR on a 'synthetic' basis which would allow market participants to use such rates through September 30, 2024. This proposal would apply to contracts that are outside the scope of the LIBOR Act, including U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked contracts that are not governed by U.S. law. Both the LIBOR Act and the proposed publication of 'synthetic' LIBOR are intended to facilitate, and reduce the risks associated with, the transition from LIBOR, including the potential for disputes or litigation.\n\nThe Firm continues to make necessary changes to its risk management systems in connection with the transition from LIBOR, including modifications to its operational systems and models. In addition, the Firm continues to monitor and evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and legislative developments relating to the transition from LIBOR. Refer to Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K and to Accounting and Reporting Developments on page 153 for additional information.",

Refer to Note 19 for additional information.\n\nBeneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs increased driven by higher issuance of commercial paper as a result of an increase in loan balances in the Firm-administered multiseller conduits. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104; and Notes 14 and 28 for additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.\n\nLong-term debt decreased driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge accounting adjustments in Treasury and CIO as a result of higher rates, and a decline in the fair value of structured notes in Markets,\n\nlargely offset by\n\n- \u00b7 net issuances of senior debt in Treasury and CIO and structured notes in Markets. Refer to Liquidity Risk Manag ement on pages 97-104 and Note 20 for additional information.\n\nStockholders' equity reflects net unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly driven by the impact of higher interest rates on the AFS portfolio and cash flow hedges in Treasury and CIO.

These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of business due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management activities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other liquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet its operating liquidity needs.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, cash provided resulted from higher accounts payable and other liabilities, lower securities borrowed, and net proceeds from sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher trading assets.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, cash provided resulted from lower trading assets and higher accounts payable and other liabilities, partially offset by higher securities borrowed and lower trading liabilities.\n\n## Investing activities\n\nThe Firm's investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans, investing in the investment securities portfolio and other short-term instruments.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, cash used resulted from net originations of loans and higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment securities.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities and higher net originations of loans, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nThe Firm's financing activities include acquiring customer deposits and issuing long-term debt and preferred stock.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, cash used reflected lower deposits, partially offset by net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings.\n- \u00b7 In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.\n- \u00b7 For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock.\n\n## *     *     *\n\nRefer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 55-56, Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104, and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 163 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the Firm's cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM'S USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\n## Non-GAAP financial measures\n\nThe Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP; these financial statements appear on pages 159-163. That presentation, which is referred to as 'reported' basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm's results that can be tracked consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm's performance with the U.S. GAAP financial statements of other companies.\n\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm's results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a 'managed' basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm's definition of managed basis starts, in each case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. These financial measures allow\n\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP financial measures at the Firm and business-segment level because these other non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors about the underlying operational performance and trends of the Firm or of the particular business segment, as the case may be, and therefore facilitate a comparison of the Firm or the business segment with the performance of its relevant competitors. Refer to Business Segment Results on pages 61-80 for additional information on these non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Firm may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n\nThe following summary table provides a reconciliation from the Firm's reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.\n\n|                                                        | 2022     | 2022                                       | 2022          | 2021     | 2021                                       | 2021          | 2020     | 2020                                       | 2020          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|--------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Year ended  December 31,  (in millions, except ratios) | Reported | Fully taxable- equivalent  adjustments (a) | Managed basis | Reported | Fully taxable- equivalent  adjustments (a) | Managed basis | Reported | Fully taxable- equivalent  adjustments (a) | Managed basis |\n| Other income                                           | $  4,322 | $  3,148                                   | $  7,470      | $  4,830 | $  3,225                                   | $  8,055      | $  4,865 | $  2,560                                   | $  7,425      |\n| Total noninterest revenue                              | 61,985   | 3,148                                      | 65,133        | 69,338   | 3,225                                      | 72,563        | 65,388   | 2,560                                      | 67,948        |\n| Net interest income                                    | 66,710   | 434                                        | 67,144        | 52,311   | 430                                        | 52,741        | 54,563   | 418                                        | 54,981        |\n| Total net revenue                                      | 128,695  | 3,582                                      | 132,277       | 121,649  | 3,655                                      | 125,304       | 119,951  | 2,978                                      | 122,929       |\n| Total noninterest expense                              | 76,140   | NA                                         | 76,140        | 71,343   | NA                                         | 71,343        | 66,656   | NA                                         | 66,656        |\n| Pre-provision profit                                   | 52,555   | 3,582                                      | 56,137        | 50,306   | 3,655                                      | 53,961        | 53,295   | 2,978                                      | 56,273        |\n| Provision for credit losses                            | 6,389    | NA                                         | 6,389         | (9,256)  | NA                                         | (9,256)       | 17,480   | NA                                         | 17,480        |\n| Income before income tax expense                       | 46,166   | 3,582                                      | 49,748        | 59,562   | 3,655                                      | 63,217        | 35,815   | 2,978                                      | 38,793        |\n| Income tax expense                                     | 8,490    | 3,582                                      | 12,072        | 11,228   | 3,655                                      | 14,883        | 6,684    | 2,978                                      | 9,662         |\n| Net income                                             | $ 37,676 | NA                                         | $ 37,676      | $ 48,334 | NA                                         | $ 48,334      | $ 29,131 | NA                                         | $ 29,131      |\n| Overhead ratio                                         | 59 %     | NM                                         | 58 %          | 59 %     | NM                                         | 57 %          | 56 %     | NM                                         | 54 %          |",

There are four major reportable business segments - Consumer & Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a Corporate segment.\n\nThe business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm's Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm's use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, on pages 58-60 for a definition of managed basis.\n\n## JPMorgan Chase\n\n| Consumer Businesses                                    | Consumer Businesses                        | Consumer Businesses                              | Wholesale Businesses            | Wholesale Businesses                                      | Wholesale Businesses                                      | Wholesale Businesses                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Consumer & Community Banking                           | Consumer & Community Banking               | Consumer & Community Banking                     | Corporate & Investment Bank     | Corporate & Investment Bank                               | Commercial  Banking                                       | Asset & Wealth  Management                    |\n| Banking &  Wealth Management (a)  \u00b7  Consumer  Banking | Home Lending  \u00b7  Home  Lending  Production | Card Services &  Auto (b) \u00b7 Card Services \u00b7 Auto | Banking  \u00b7  Investment  Banking | Markets &  Securities Services  \u00b7  Fixed  Income  Markets | \u00b7  Middle  Market  Banking  \u00b7  Corporate  Client  Banking | \u00b7  Asset  Management  \u00b7  Global  Private Bank |\n\n- (a) In the fourth quarter of 2022, Consumer & Business Banking was renamed Banking & Wealth Management ('BWM').\n- (b) In the fourth quarter of 2022, Card & Auto was renamed Card Services & Auto.\n\n## Description of business segment reporting methodology\n\nResults of the business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm's LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.\n\n## Revenue sharing\n\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm's clients and customers, the participating business segments may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\n\n## Expense Allocation\n\nWhere business segments use services provided by corporate support units, or another business segment, the costs of those services are allocated to the respective business segments. The expense is generally\n\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services provided. In contrast, certain costs and investments related to corporate support units, technology and operations that are not currently utilized by any LOB, are not allocated to the business segments and are retained in Corporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally includes costs that would not be incurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses, and other items not aligned with a particular business segment.\n\n## Funds transfer pricing\n\nFunds transfer pricing ('FTP') is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments.\n\nAs a result of the rising interest rate environment, the cost of funds for assets and the credits earned for liabilities have generally increased, impacting the business segments' net interest income. During the period ended December 31, 2022, this has resulted in higher cost of funds for loans and contributed to margin expansion on deposits.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on page 137 for additional information.\n\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation As part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost all of the cost of the credit spread component of outstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends is allocated to the reportable business segments, while the balance of the cost is retained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the cost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock dividends to the business segments is aligned with the relevant regulatory capital requirements and funding needs of the LOBs, as applicable. The allocated cost of unsecured long-term debt is included in a business segment's net interest income, and net income is reduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a\n\nbusiness segment's net income applicable to common equity.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for additional information.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. The Firm's allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized Risk-weighted assets ('RWA'), Basel III Advanced RWA, the global systemically important banks ('GSIB') surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of January 1, 2023, the Firm has changed its line of business capital allocations primarily as a result of updates to the Firm's capital requirements and changes in RWA for each LOB.\n\nRefer to Line of business equity on page 93 for additional information on capital allocation.\n\n## Segment Results - Managed Basis\n\nThe following tables summarize the Firm's results by segment for the periods indicated.\n\n| Year ended December 31,      | Consumer & Community Banking   | Consumer & Community Banking   | Consumer & Community Banking   | Corporate & Investment Bank   | Corporate & Investment Bank   | Corporate & Investment Bank   | Commercial Banking   | Commercial Banking   | Commercial Banking   |\n|------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| (in millions, except ratios) | 2022                           | 2021                           | 2020                           | 2022                          | 2021                          | 2020                          | 2022                 | 2021                 | 2020                 |\n| Total net revenue            | $  55,017                      | $  50,073                      | $  51,268                      | $ 47,899                      | $  51,749                     | $  49,284                     | $ 11,533             | $  10,008            | $  9,313             |\n| Total noninterest expense    | 31,471                         | 29,256                         | 27,990                         | 27,087                        | 25,325                        | 23,538                        | 4,719                | 4,041                | 3,798                |\n| Pre-provision profit/(loss)  | 23,546                         | 20,817                         | 23,278                         | 20,812                        | 26,424                        | 25,746                        | 6,814                | 5,967                | 5,515                |\n| Provision for credit losses  | 3,813                          | (6,989)                        | 12,312                         | 1,158                         | (1,174)                       | 2,726                         | 1,268                | (947)                | 2,113                |\n| Net income/(loss)            | 14,871                         | 20,930                         | 8,217                          | 14,970                        | 21,134                        | 17,094                        | 4,213                | 5,246                | 2,578                |\n| Return on equity ('ROE')     | 29 %                           | 41 %                           | 15 %                           | 14 %                          | 25 %                          | 20 %                          | 16 %                 | 21 %                 | 11 %                 |\n\n| Year ended December 31,      | Asset & Wealth Management   | Asset & Wealth Management   | Asset & Wealth Management   | Corporate   | Corporate   | Corporate   | Total     | Total     | Total     |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| (in millions, except ratios) | 2022                        | 2021                        | 2020                        | 2022        | 2021        | 2020        | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n| Total net revenue            | $ 17,748                    | $  16,957                   | $  14,240                   | $  80       | $ (3,483)   | $ (1,176)   | $ 132,277 | $ 125,304 | $ 122,929 |\n| Total noninterest expense    | 11,829                      | 10,919                      | 9,957                       | 1,034       | 1,802       | 1,373       | 76,140    | 71,343    | 66,656    |\n| Pre-provision profit/(loss)  | 5,919                       | 6,038                       | 4,283                       | (954)       | (5,285)     | (2,549)     | 56,137    | 53,961    | 56,273    |\n| Provision for credit losses  | 128                         | (227)                       | 263                         | 22          | 81          | 66          | 6,389     | (9,256)   | 17,480    |\n| Net income/(loss)            | 4,365                       | 4,737                       | 2,992                       | (743)       | (3,713)     | (1,750)     | 37,676    | 48,334    | 29,131    |\n| Return on equity ('ROE')     | 25 %                        | 33 %                        | 28 %                        | NM          | NM          | NM          | 14 %      | 19 %      | 12 %      |\n\n## Selected Firmwide Metrics\n\nThe following tables present key metrics for Wealth Management, which consists of the Global Private Bank in AWM and J.P.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.\n\nNoninterest expense was $31.5 billion, up 8%, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 investments in the business and higher structural expenses, predominantly driven by compensation, technology and marketing,\n\n## partially offset by\n\n- \u00b7 lower volume- and revenue-related expenses, predominantly driven by lower depreciation expense on lower auto lease assets, partially offset by higher operating losses.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $3.8 billion, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 net charge-offs of $2.7 billion, down from $2.8 billion in the prior year and included\n- - a $309 million decrease in Card Services, reflecting the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending,\n\n## largely offset by\n\n- - a $190 million increase in net charge-offs in Auto and BWM as net charge-offs in the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs, and\n- \u00b7 a $1.1 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses driven by\n- - $950 million in Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances, and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede, and\n- - $175 million in Home Lending.\n\nThe prior year included a $9.8 billion reduction in the allowance for credit losses across CCB.\n\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 127-129 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.",

The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.\n- - Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, down 74%, and debt underwriting fees were $2.8 billion , dow n 43%, due to lower issuance activity.\n- - Advisory fees were $3.1 billion, down 30%, driven by a lower level of announced deals.\n- \u00b7 Payments revenue was $7.4 billion, up 18%, and included the net impact of equity investments. Excluding this net impact, revenue was $7.8 billion, up 33%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees on higher volumes.\n- \u00b7 Lending revenue was $1.4 billion, up 38%, driven by higher net interest income primarily on higher loans, as well as fair value gains on hedges of retained loans, compared with losses in the prior year.\n\nMarkets & Securities Services revenue was $32.6 billion, up 2%. Markets revenue was $29.0 billion, up 6%.\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed Income Markets revenue was $18.6 billion, up 10%, driven by strong performance in the macro businesses amid volatile market conditions, particularly in Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates, partially offset by lower revenue in Securitized Products.\n- \u00b7 Equity Markets revenue was $10.4 billion, down 2%, driven by lower revenue in Cash Equities, largely offset by Equity Derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Securities Services revenue was $4.5 billion, up 4%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in fees, largely offset by lower average market values of assets under custody and lower deposits.\n- \u00b7 Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $836 million, reflecting funding spread widening, and, to a lesser extent, losses on exposures relating to commodities and Russia and Russia-associated counterparties, compared with a gain of $250 million in the prior year.\n\nNoninterest expense was $27.1 billion, up 7%, driven by higher structural expense and investments in the business, including higher compensation, partially offset by lower revenue-related compensation as well as lower legal expense.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.2 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.\n\nThe provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.",

Markets includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets revenue consists of principal transactions, fees, commissions and other income, as well as net interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets business performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may occur across revenue line items. For example, securities that generate net interest income may be risk-managed by derivatives that are reflected at fair value in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of these income statement line items.\n\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial instruments and commodities transactions that arise from client-driven market-making activity. Principal transactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants, as well as 'inventoryrelated revenue', which is revenue recognized from gains and losses on derivatives and other instruments that the Firm has been holding in anticipation of, or in response to, client demand, and changes in the fair value of instruments used by the Firm to actively manage the risk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal transactions revenue recognized upon executing new transactions with market participants is affected by many factors including the level of client activity, the bid-offer spread (which is the\n\ndifference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors are interrelated and sensitive to the same factors that drive inventory-related revenue, which include general market conditions, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and commodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic conditions.",

Net interest income was $8.2 billion, up 35%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and growth in loans, predominantly offset by the impact of higher funding costs and lower deposits.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, down 15%, driven by lower investment banking revenue and net markdowns on held-for-sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing portfolio. The decreases were partially offset by a gain on an equity method investment received in partial satisfaction of a loan.\n\nNoninterest expense was $4.7 billion, up 17%, largely driven by higher volume-and revenue-related expense, as well as structural expense, including higher compensation expense, and expense associated with growth in payments.\n\nThe provision for credit losses was $1.3 billion, predominantly driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses, reflecting deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook and loan growth.\n\nThe provision for credit losses in the prior year was a net benefit of $947 million, driven by a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses.",

        "page_content": "## Asset Management has two high-level measures of its overall fund performance.\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star: Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on their risk adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of industrywide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of industrywide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance associated with a fund's three-, five and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star ratings are provided at the individual share class level. The Nomura 'star rating' is based on three-year riskadjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of history are not rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a 'primary share class' level to represent the star rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The performance data may have been different if all share classes had been included. Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n- \u00b7 Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three and five years) :All quartile rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset values used to derive these rankings are sourced from the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on fund performance and associated peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a 'primary share class' level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong SAR funds and at the fund level for all other funds.

In connection with the sale, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the rate at which the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares ('Visa A shares'). Refer to Note 2 for additional information,\n- \u00b7 higher net gains related to certain Other Corporate investments, and\n- \u00b7 proceeds from an insurance settlement in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nNoninterest expense was $1.0 billion, down $768 million, predominantly driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 lower structural expense reflecting the impact of movements in foreign exchange on certain expenses primarily as a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening, and lower retained technology expense, and\n- \u00b7 a lower contribution to the Firm's Foundation. partially offset by\n- \u00b7 higher investments, including the costs associated with the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.\n\nThe net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates associated with the foreign exchange risk that is transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues and expenses was not material to net income.

The risks managed by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm's four major reportable business segments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and offbalance sheet assets and liabilities.\n\nTreasury and CIO seeks to achieve the Firm's asset-liability management objectives generally by investing in highquality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm's investment securities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also uses derivatives to meet the Firm's assetliability management objectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives. In addition, Treasury and CIO manages the Firm's cash position primarily through deposits at central banks and investments in short-term instruments. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on liquidity and funding risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 for information on interest rate and foreign exchange risks.\n\nThe investment securities portfolio predominantly consists of U.S. and non-U.S. government securities, U.S. GSE and government agency and nonagency mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other ABS. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and, where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings).

        "page_content": "## FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase's business activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or offers other products or services, the Firm takes on some degree of risk. The Firm's overall objective is to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a manner that balances serving the interests of its clients, customers and investors, and protecting the safety and soundness of the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management requires, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 Acceptance of responsibility, including identification and escalation of risks by all individuals within the Firm;\n- \u00b7 Ownership of risk identification, assessment, data and management within each of the LOBs and Corporate; and\n- \u00b7 A Firmwide risk governance and oversight structure.\n\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with strong internal governance and independent oversight by the Board of Directors (the 'Board'). The impact of risk and control issues is carefully considered in the Firm's performance evaluation and incentive compensation processes.\n\n## Risk governance framework\n\nThe Firm's risk governance framework involves understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDrivers of risks are factors that cause a risk to exist. Drivers of risks include, but are not limited to, the economic environment, regulatory or government policy, competitor or market evolution, business decisions, process or judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing, dysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\n\nTypes of risks are categories by which risks manifest themselves. The Firm's risks are generally categorized in the following four risk types:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital, liquidity or reputation associated with poorly designed or failed business plans or inadequate responses to changes in the operating environment.\n- \u00b7 Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including\n\n- consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.\n- \u00b7 Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of changes in market factors, such as interest and foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of assets and liabilities held for both the short and long term.\n- \u00b7 Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk.\n\nImpacts of risks are consequences of risks, both quantitative and qualitative. There may be many consequences of risks manifesting, including quantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings and capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or penalties, or qualitative impacts such as damage to the Firm's reputation, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory and enforcement actions.\n\nThe Firm's risk governance framework is managed on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an Independent Risk Management ('IRM') function, which is comprised of Risk Management and Compliance. The Firm's Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') appoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors (the 'Board Risk Committee'), the Firm's Chief Risk Officer ('CRO') to lead the IRM function and maintain the risk governance framework of the Firm. The framework is subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee through its review and approval of the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy.\n\nThe Firm's CRO oversees and delegates authority to the Firmwide Risk Executives ('FREs'), the Chief Risk Officers of the LOBs and Corporate ('LOB CROs'), and the Firm's Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO'), who, in turn, establish Risk Management and Compliance organizations, develop the Firm's risk governance policies and standards, and define and oversee the implementation of the Firm's risk governance framework. The LOB CROs oversee risks that arise in their LOBs and Corporate, while FREs oversee risks that span across the LOBs and Corporate, functions and regions. Each area of the Firm giving rise to risk is expected to operate within the parameters identified by the IRM function, and within its own management-identified risk and control standards.\n\n## Three lines of defense\n\nThe Firm's 'three lines of defense' are as follows:\n\nThe first line of defense consists of each LOB, Treasury and CIO, and certain Other Corporate initiatives, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management. The first line of defense own the identification of risks within their respective organizations and the design and execution of controls to manage those risks.",

IRM is also responsible for the identification of risks within its respective organization, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and for the development and implementation of policies and standards with respect to its own processes.\n\nThe third line of defense is Internal Audit, an independent function that provides objective assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls, governance and risk management. The Internal Audit function is headed by the General Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the CEO.\n\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute to the Firmwide control environment but are not considered part of a particular line of defense, including Finance, Human Resources and Legal. These other functions are responsible for the identification of risks within their respective organizations, adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations and implementation of the risk governance framework established by IRM.\n\n## Risk identification and ownership\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate own the identification of risks within their respective organizations, as well as the design and execution of controls, including IRM-specified controls, to manage those risks. To support this activity, the Firm has a risk identification framework designed to facilitate each LOB and Corporate's responsibility to identify material risks inherent to the Firm's business and operational activities, catalog them in a central repository and review material risks on a regular basis. The IRM function reviews and challenges the LOB and Corporate's identified risks, maintains the central repository and provides the consolidated Firmwide results to the Firmwide Risk Committee ('FRC') and the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe Firm's overall appetite for risk is governed by 'Risk Appetite' frameworks for quantitative and qualitative risks. Periodically the Firm's risk appetite is set and approved by senior management (including the CEO and CRO) and approved by the Board Risk Committee. Quantitative and qualitative risks are assessed to monitor and measure the Firm's capacity to take risk consistent with its stated risk appetite. Risk appetite results are reported to the Board Risk Committee.",

In addition, there are other committees, forums and channels of escalation that support the oversight of risk that are not shown in the chart below or described in this Form 10-K.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Firm's Operating Committee, which consists of the Firm's CEO, CRO, Chief Financial Officer ('CFO'), General Counsel, CEOs of the LOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to and may refer matters to the Firm's Board of Directors.

This includes monitoring the Firm's financial performance and condition and reviewing the strategic objectives and plans of the Firm. The Board carries out a significant portion of its oversight responsibilities through its principal standing committees, each of which consists solely of independent members of the Board.

Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of management of the bank, which it discharges both acting directly and through the principal standing committees of the Firm's Board of Directors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the responsibility of the Board\n\nRisk Committee and the Audit Committee, respectively, and, with respect to compensation and other managementrelated matters, the Compensation & Management Development Committee.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management's responsibility to implement a global risk management framework reasonably designed to identify, assess and manage the Firm's risks. The Board Risk Committee's responsibilities include approval of applicable primary risk policies and review of certain associated frameworks, analysis and reporting established by management. Breaches in risk appetite and parameters, issues that may have a material adverse impact on the Firm, including capital and liquidity issues, and other significant risk-related matters are escalated to the Board Risk Committee, as appropriate.\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of management's responsibility to ensure that there is an effective system of controls reasonably designed to safeguard the Firm's assets and income, ensure the integrity of the Firm's financial statements, and maintain compliance with the Firm's ethical standards, policies, plans and procedures, and with laws and regulations. It also assists the Board in its oversight of the qualifications, independence and performance of the Firm's independent registered public accounting firm, and of the performance of the Firm's Internal Audit function.",

As part of the Board's role of reinforcing, demonstrating and communicating the 'tone at the top,' the CMDC oversees the Firm's culture, including reviewing updates from management regarding significant conduct issues and any related actions with respect to employees, including compensation actions.\n\nThe Public Responsibility Committee oversees and reviews the Firm's positions and practices on public responsibility matters such as community investment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer practices and other public policy issues that reflect the Firm's values and character and could impact the Firm's reputation among its stakeholders. The Committee also provides guidance on these matters to management and the Board, as appropriate.\n\nThe Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee exercises general oversight with respect to the governance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the qualifications of and recommends to the Board proposed nominees for election to the Board. The Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board corporate governance practices applicable to the Firm. It also reviews the framework for assessing the Board's performance and self-evaluation.\n\n## Management oversight\n\nThe Firm's senior management-level committees that are primarily responsible for key risk-related functions include:\n\nThe Firmwide Risk Committee ('FRC') is the Firm's highest management-level risk committee. It oversees the risks inherent in the Firm's business and provides a forum for discussion of topics, and issues that are raised or escalated by its members and other committees.\n\nThe Firmwide Control Committee ('FCC') is an escalation committee for senior management to review and discuss the Firmwide operational risk environment including identified issues, operational risk metrics and significant events that have been escalated.\n\nLine of Business and Regional Risk Committees are responsible for overseeing the governance, limits, and controls that have been established within the scope of their respective activities. These committees review the ways in which the particular LOB or the businesses operating in a particular region could be exposed to adverse outcomes, with a focus on identifying, accepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of matters brought to these committees.\n\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control Committees oversee the operational risk and control environment of their respective business or function, inclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct Risks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible for reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks and other data that may impact the level of operational risk in a business or function, addressing key operational risk issues, with an emphasis on processes with control concerns and overseeing control remediation.\n\nThe Asset and Liability Committee ('ALCO') is responsible for overseeing the Firm's asset and liability management ('ALM'), including the activities and frameworks supporting management of the balance sheet, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, and capital risk.\n\nThe Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum ('VGF') is composed of senior finance and risk executives and is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm.\n\n## Risk governance and oversight functions\n\nThe Firm manages its risk through risk governance and oversight functions. The scope of a particular function or business activity may include one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of risk. For example, Country Risk Management oversees country risk which may be a driver of risk or an aggregation of exposures that could give rise to multiple risk types such as credit or market risk.\n\nThe following sections discuss the risk governance and oversight functions that have been established to manage the risks inherent in the Firm's business activities.\n\n| Risk governance and oversight functions   | Page    |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Strategic Risk                            | 85      |\n| Capital Risk                              | 86-96   |\n| Liquidity Risk                            | 97-104  |\n| Reputation Risk                           | 105     |\n| Consumer Credit Risk                      | 110-115 |\n| Wholesale Credit Risk                     | 116-126 |\n| Investment Portfolio Risk                 | 130     |\n| Market Risk                               | 131-138 |\n| Country Risk                              | 139-140 |\n| Climate Risk                              | 141     |\n| Operational Risk                          | 142-148 |\n| Compliance Risk                           | 145     |\n| Conduct Risk                              | 146     |\n| Legal Risk                                | 147     |\n| Estimations and Model Risk                | 148     |",

Maintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through economic volatility is considered a strategic imperative of the Firm's Board of Directors, CEO and Operating Committee. The Firm's fortress balance sheet philosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust liquidity. The Firm's capital risk management strategy focuses on maintaining long-term stability to enable the Firm to build and invest in market-leading businesses, including in highly stressed environments. Senior management considers the implications on the Firm's capital prior to making significant decisions that could impact future business activities. In addition to considering the Firm's earnings outlook, senior management evaluates all sources and uses of capital with a view to ensuring the Firm's capital strength.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Firm has a Capital Risk Management function whose primary objective is to provide independent oversight of capital risk across the Firm.\n\nCapital Risk Management's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Defining, monitoring and reporting capital risk metrics;\n- \u00b7 Establishing, calibrating and monitoring capital risk limits and indicators, including capital risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 Developing a process to classify, monitor and report capital limit breaches;\n- \u00b7 Performing an assessment of the Firm's capital management activities, including changes made to the Contingency Capital Plan described below; and\n- \u00b7 Conducting assessments of the Firm's regulatory capital framework intended to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory capital rules.\n\n## Capital management\n\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for capital management.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Firm's capital management are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain sufficient capital in order to continue to build and invest in the Firm's businesses through the cycle and in stressed environments;\n- \u00b7 Retain flexibility to take advantage of future investment opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Promote the Firm's ability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 Ensure the Firm operates above the minimum regulatory capital ratios as well as maintain 'well-capitalized' status for the Firm and its insured depository institution ('IDI') subsidiaries at all times under applicable regulatory capital requirements;\n\n- \u00b7 Meet capital distribution objectives; and\n- \u00b7 Maintain sufficient capital resources to operate throughout a resolution period in accordance with the Firm's preferred resolution strategy.\n\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\n\n- \u00b7 Establishing internal minimum capital requirements and maintaining a strong capital governance framework. The internal minimum capital levels consider the Firm's regulatory capital requirements as well as an internal assessment of capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in stress events;\n- \u00b7 Retaining flexibility in order to react to a range of potential events; and\n- \u00b7 Regular monitoring of the Firm's capital position and following prescribed escalation protocols, both at the Firm and material legal entity levels.\n\n## Governance\n\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm's capital management include the Capital Governance Committee, the Firmwide ALCO and LOB and regional ALCOs, and the CIO, Treasury and Corporate ('CTC') Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee periodically reviews the Firm's capital risk tolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for additional discussion of the Firmwide ALCO and other risk-related committees.\n\n## Capital planning and stress testing\n\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review The Federal Reserve requires large Bank Holding Companies ('BHCs'), including the Firm, to submit at least annually a capital plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Federal Reserve uses Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ('CCAR') and other stress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs have sufficient capital during periods of economic and financial stress, and have robust, forward-looking capital assessment and planning processes in place that address each BHC's unique risks to enable it to absorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through CCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC's capital adequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment processes ('ICAAP'), as well as its plans to make capital distributions, such as dividend payments or stock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results under the severely adverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to determine each firm's Stress Capital Buffer ('SCB') requirement for the coming year.\n\nOn June 27, 2022, the Firm announced that it had completed the Federal Reserve's 2022 CCAR stress test process. On August 4, 2022, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2022 SCB requirement of 4.0% (up from 3.2%), and the Firm's Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including regulatory buffers, of 12.0% (up from 11.2%). The 2022 SCB requirement became effective on October 1, 2022, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2023.",

        "page_content": "Refer to Capital actions on page 94 for information on actions taken by the Firm's Board of Directors.\n\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process Annually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs the Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of the Firm's processes for managing the sources and uses of capital as well as compliance with supervisory expectations for capital planning and capital adequacy. The Firm's ICAAP integrates stress testing protocols with capital planning. The Firm's Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the capital planning framework.\n\nStress testing assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on the Firm's earnings and capital. Economic scenarios, and the parameters underlying those scenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly across the businesses. These scenarios are articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key drivers of business results; global market shocks, which generate short-term but severe trading losses; and idiosyncratic operational risk events. The scenarios are intended to capture and stress key vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the Firm. In addition to CCAR and other periodic stress testing, management also considers tailored stress scenarios and sensitivity analyses, as necessary.\n\n## Contingency Capital Plan\n\nThe Firm's Contingency Capital Plan establishes the capital management framework for the Firm and specifies the principles underlying the Firm's approach towards capital management in normal economic conditions and in stressed environments. The Contingency Capital Plan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted capital levels and meets minimum capital requirements, monitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned capital distributions, and sets out the capital contingency actions that are expected to be taken or considered at various levels of capital depletion during a period of stress.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards, for the consolidated financial holding company. The OCC establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital requirements generally follow the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\n\n## Basel III Overview\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating RWA, which are on-balance sheet assets and offbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ('Basel III Standardized'), and an advanced approach ('Basel III Advanced'). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm's Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\n\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for calculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk RWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely on the use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is calculated on a generally consistent basis between Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated under these approaches, the Firm may supplement such amounts to incorporate management judgment and feedback from its regulators.\n\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, to calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 93 for additional information.\n\n## Key Regulatory Developments\n\n## CECL regulatory capital transition.\n\nUntil December 31, 2021, the Firm's capital reflected a two year delay of the effects of CECL provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBeginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL capital benefit is being phased out at 25% per year over a threeyear period. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the remaining $2.2 billion benefit associated with the CECL capital transition provisions.\n\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2022, the Firm phased out 25% of the other CECL capital transition provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as applicable.\n\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.",

On January 1, 2022, the Firm adopted 'Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk' ('SA-CCR'), which replaced the Current Exposure Method used to measure derivatives counterparty exposure under the Standardized and Advanced approach RWA where internal models are not used, as well as leverage exposure used to calculate the SLR in the regulatory capital framework. The rule issued by the U.S. banking regulators in November 2019 applies to Basel III Advanced Approaches banking organizations, such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nThe adoption of SA-CCR on January 1, 2022 increased the Firm's Standardized RWA by approximately $40 billion based on the Firm's derivatives exposure as of December 31, 2021, which resulted in a decrease of approximately 30 bps to the Firm's CET1 capital ratio and a modest decrease in its total leverage exposure. In addition, the adoption of SA-CCR increased the Firm's Advanced RWA, but to a lesser extent than Standardized RWA.",

The capital conservation buffer incorporates a GSIB surcharge, a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital conservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory capital requirements and a variable SCB requirement, floored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital requirements.\n\nUnder the Federal Reserve's GSIB rule, the Firm is required to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual basis under two separately prescribed methods based on data for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject to the higher of the two. 'Method 1' reflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel Committee's assessment methodology, and is calculated by the Financial Stability Board ('FSB') across five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional activity,\n\ninterconnectedness, complexity and substitutability. 'Method 2', calculated by the Firm, modifies the Method 1 requirements to include a measure of short-term wholesale funding in place of substitutability, and introduces a GSIB score 'multiplication factor'.",

For 2023, the Firm's effective GSIB surcharge under Method 1 and Method 2 has increased to 2.5% and 4.0%, respectively.\n\n|          | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Method 1 | 2.5 %  | 2.0 %  | 2.0 %  |\n| Method 2 | 4.0 %  | 3.5 %  | 3.5 %  |\n\nOn November 21, 2022, the FSB released its annual GSIB list based upon data as of December 31, 2021, which affirmed the Firm's Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.5% (up from 2.0%), effective January 1, 2023.\n\nThe Firm's Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2021 is 4.5%, which will be effective January 1, 2024. The Firm's estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2022 is 4.5%. Accordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm's effective GSIB surcharge is expected to increase to 4.5% on January 1, 2024.\n\nThe U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for setting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which large, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2022, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer remained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be increased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can be calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period.\n\nFailure to maintain regulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation buffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain executive discretionary bonus payments.\n\n## Risk-based Capital Targets\n\nThe Firm's current target for its Basel III Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0% for the first quarter of 2023, increasing to 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024 with consideration for an increase in the GSIB surcharge in 2024, and assuming no change in the Stress Capital Buffer. The Firm's quarterly capital ratios may vary from these targets dependent on market conditions. These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules currently in effect.\n\n## Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity\n\nThe Federal Reserve's TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB toptier holding companies, including the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt ('eligible LTD'). Refer to TLAC on page 95 for additional information.\n\n## Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Requirements Supplementary leverage ratio\n\nBanking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR of 3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage buffer.\n\nThe SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm's total leverage exposure. Total leverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm's total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted to be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and derivatives potential future exposure.\n\nFailure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory requirement will result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as on certain executive discretionary bonus payments.\n\n## Other regulatory capital\n\nIn addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel III, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries must also maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be 'well-capitalized' under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action ('PCA') requirements of the FDIC Improvement Act ('FDICIA'), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.\n\nAdditional information regarding the Firm's capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital standards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm's Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for further information on the Firm's Basel III measures.",

Liquidity Risk Management's responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Defining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk metrics;\n- \u00b7 Independently establishing and monitoring limits and indicators, including liquidity risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 Developing a process to classify, monitor and report limit breaches;\n- \u00b7 Performing an independent review of liquidity risk management processes to evaluate their adequacy and effectiveness based on LRM's Independent Review Framework;\n- \u00b7 Monitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal entity liquidity stress tests, regulatory defined metrics, as well as liquidity positions, balance sheet variances and funding activities; and\n- \u00b7 Approving or escalating for review new or updated liquidity stress assumptions.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for liquidity management.\n\nThe primary objectives of the Firm's liquidity management are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the Firm's core businesses and material legal entities are able to operate in support of client needs and meet contractual and contingent financial obligations through normal economic cycles as well as during stress events, and\n- \u00b7 Manage an optimal funding mix and availability of liquidity sources.\n\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through:\n\n- \u00b7 Analyzing and understanding the liquidity characteristics of the assets and liabilities of the Firm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account legal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;\n- \u00b7 Developing internal liquidity stress testing assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Defining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entityspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and contingency funding plans;\n- \u00b7 Managing liquidity within the Firm's approved liquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;\n- \u00b7 Managing compliance with regulatory requirements related to funding and liquidity risk; and\n- \u00b7 Setting FTP in accordance with underlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet assets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance sheet items.\n\nAs part of the Firm's overall liquidity management strategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using a centralized, global approach designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 Optimize liquidity sources and uses;\n- \u00b7 Monitor exposures;\n- \u00b7 Identify constraints on the transfer of liquidity between the Firm's legal entities; and\n- \u00b7 Maintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity at a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.\n\n## Governance\n\nCommittees responsible for liquidity governance include the Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional ALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for formal approval, the Firm's liquidity risk tolerances, liquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages 81-84 for further discussion of ALCO and other riskrelated committees.\n\n## Internal stress testing\n\nLiquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the Firm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm's resolution and recovery planning. Stress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co. ('Parent Company') and the Firm's material legal entities on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the Firm's contractual financial obligations are met and take into consideration:\n\n- \u00b7 Varying levels of access to unsecured and secured funding markets;\n- \u00b7 Estimated non-contractual and contingent cash outflows;\n- \u00b7 Considerations of credit rating downgrades;\n- \u00b7 Collateral haircuts; and\n- \u00b7 Potential impediments to the availability and transferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and material legal entities such as regulatory, legal or other restrictions.\n\nLiquidity outflows are modeled across a range of time horizons and currency dimensions and contemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.\n\nResults of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm's funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as a source of funding for the Firm through equity and long-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the 'IHC'), provides funding support to the ongoing operations of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.

The CFP also identifies the alternative contingent funding and liquidity resources available to the Firm and its legal entities in a period of stress.\n\n## LCR and HQLA\n\nThe LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations as defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of cash and certain high-quality liquid securities as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nUnder the LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its standalone 100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm's reported eligible HQLA.\n\nEstimated net cash outflows are based on standardized stress outflow and inflow rates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to the balances of the Firm's assets, sources of funds, and obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022, September 30, 2022 and December 31, 2021 based on the Firm's interpretation of the LCR framework.\n\n|                               | Three months ended         | Three months ended         | Three months ended         |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Average amount (in millions)  | December 31,  2022         | September 30,  2022        | December 31, 2021          |\n| JPMorgan Chase & Co.:         |                            |                            |                            |\n| HQLA                          |                            |                            |                            |\n| Eligible cash (a)             | $  542,847                 | $  589,158                 | $  703,384                 |\n| Eligible securities (b)(c)    | 190,201                    | 126,913                    | 34,738                     |\n| Total HQLA (d)                | $  733,048                 | $  716,071                 | $  738,122                 |\n| Net cash outflows             | $  652,580                 | $  635,072                 | $  664,801                 |\n| LCR                           | 112 %                      | 113 %                      | 111 %                      |\n| Net excess eligible  HQLA (d) | $  80,468                  | $  80,999                  | $  73,321                  |\n| JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:    | JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: | JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: | JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.: |\n| LCR                           | 151 %                      | 165 %                      | 178 %                      |\n\n- (b) Predominantly U.S. Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2022, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2022 reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with a decline in deposits, and loan growth.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from loan growth and a decline in deposits as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.\n\nThe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to the Firm's U.S. LCR Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for a further discussion of the Firm's LCR.\n\n## Other liquidity sources\n\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $694 billion and $914 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as noted above.\n\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $323 billion and $308 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm's eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased credit card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.",

Deposits are the primary funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through short- or long-term secured borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured\n\nlong-term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The Firm's non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm's investment securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term liquid investments based on their interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics.\n\nRefer to Note 28 for additional information on off-balance sheet obligations.\n\n## Deposits\n\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31,   |              |              | Average      | Average      |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in millions)                              | 2022         | 2021         | 2022         | 2021         |\n| Consumer & Community Banking               | $  1,131,611 | $  1,148,110 | $  1,162,680 | $  1,054,956 |\n| Corporate & Investment Bank                | 689,893      | 707,791      | 739,700      | 760,048      |\n| Commercial Banking                         | 271,342      | 323,954      | 294,180      | 301,343      |\n| Asset & Wealth Management                  | 233,130      | 282,052      | 261,489      | 230,296      |\n| Corporate                                  | 14,203       | 396          | 9,866        | 511          |\n| Total Firm                                 | $  2,340,179 | $  2,462,303 | $  2,467,915 | $  2,347,154 |\n\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce the Firm's reliance on the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion of the Firm's deposits are consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits, which are both considered to be stable sources of liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered to be stable sources of liquidity because they are generated from customers that maintain operating service relationships with the Firm.\n\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.\n\nAverage deposits were higher for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 growth in CCB from existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers, partially offset by a decline in deposits starting in the second half of 2022, impacted by growth in customer spending, and\n- \u00b7 net inflows in AWM resulting from the residual effects of certain government actions, partially offset by migration into investments starting in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of the rising interest rate environment\n\npartially offset by\n\n- \u00b7 lower average deposits in CIB and CB due to attrition, also as a result of the rising interest rate environment.\n\nPeriod-end deposits decreased reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 attrition in CB and CIB, particularly non-operating deposits in CB, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in Markets,\n- \u00b7 net outflows into investments in AWM amid the rising interest rate environment, and\n- \u00b7 a decline in balances in existing accounts in CCB due to higher customer spending, predominantly offset by net inflows into new accounts.\n\nThe increase in deposits for both spot and averages in Corporate was driven by the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives.\n\nRefer to the discussion of the Firm's Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 55-56 and pages 61-80, respectively, for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.\n\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance protection that provides additional funding stability and results in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be available to depositors in the countries in which the deposits are placed. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ('FDIC') provides deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a U.S. depository institution. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firmwide estimated uninsured deposits were $1,383.7 billion and $1,489.6 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating deposits.",

These instruments are secured predominantly by high-quality securities collateral, including governmentissued debt and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased at December 31, 2022, compared with December 31, 2021, due to higher secured financing of trading assets in Markets, partially offset by lower secured financing of AFS investment securities in Treasury and CIO.\n\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due to investment and financing activities of clients, the Firm's demand for financing, the ongoing management of the mix of the Firm's liabilities, including its secured and unsecured financing (for both the investment securities and marketmaking portfolios), and other market and portfolio factors.\n\nThe Firm's sources of short-term unsecured funding primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial paper and other borrowed funds.\n\nThe decrease in period-end commercial paper and the increase in average balances for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the respective prior year periods, was due to changes in net issuance levels primarily for short-term liquidity management.",

Reductions in these ratings could have an adverse effect on the Firm's access to liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it\n\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings downgrades.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm's funding requirements for VIEs and other third-party commitments may be adversely affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features in Note 5 for additional information on the impact of a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral agreements.\n\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm's principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:\n\n|                           |                   |                    |          |                   |                    |          | J.P.

All other ratings and outlooks of the Parent Company and those of the Firm's principal bank and nonbank subsidiaries were affirmed by Moody's.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, or stock price.\n\nCritical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital and liquidity ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, and diverse funding sources. Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, and litigation matters, as well as their broader ratings methodologies. Changes in any of these factors could lead to changes in the Firm's credit ratings.",

Reputation risk is inherently challenging to identify, manage, and quantify.\n\nThe Firm's reputation risk management function includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance policy and a standard consistent with the reputation risk framework\n- \u00b7 Overseeing the governance execution through processes and infrastructure that support consistent identification, escalation, management and monitoring of reputation risk issues Firmwide\n\nThe types of events that result in reputation risk are wideranging and may be introduced by the Firm's employees and the clients, customers and counterparties with which the Firm does business. These events could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, penalties or other sanctions, as well as other harm to the Firm.\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the principles for managing reputation risk for the Firm. It is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and Corporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when deciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a transaction or client relationship, enter a new jurisdiction, initiate a business process or consider any other activity. Environmental impacts and social concerns are increasingly important considerations in assessing the Firm's reputation risk, and are a component of the Firm's reputation risk governance.\n\nReputation risk issues that are deemed to be material are escalated as appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments, including consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or customer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of clients and customers, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients to individual consumers and small businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its home lending, credit card, auto, and business banking businesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk through its underwriting, lending, market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through its operating services activities (such as cash management and clearing activities), and securities financing activities. The Firm is also exposed to credit risk through its investment securities portfolio and cash placed with banks.\n\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages credit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit risk policies and procedures. The Firm's credit risk management governance includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a credit risk policy framework\n- \u00b7 Monitoring, measuring and managing credit risk across all portfolio segments, including transaction and exposure approval\n- \u00b7 Setting industry and geographic concentration limits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting guidelines\n- \u00b7 Assigning and managing credit authorities in connection with the approval of credit exposure\n- \u00b7 Managing criticized exposures and delinquent loans, and\n- \u00b7 Estimating credit losses and supporting appropriate credit risk-based capital management\n\n## Risk identification and measurement\n\nTo measure credit risk, the Firm employs several methodologies for estimating the likelihood of obligor or counterparty default. Methodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending on several factors, including type of asset (e.g., consumer versus wholesale), risk measurement parameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower's credit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk management and collection processes (e.g., retail collection center versus centrally managed workout groups). Credit risk measurement is based on the probability of default of an obligor or counterparty, the loss severity given a default event and the exposure at default.\n\nBased on these factors and the methodology and estimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm estimates credit losses for its exposures. The allowance for loan losses reflects estimated credit losses related to the consumer and wholesale held-for-investment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-related commitments reflects estimated credit losses related to the Firm's lending-related commitments and the allowance for investment securities reflects estimated credit losses related to the investment securities portfolio. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical Accounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information.\n\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses are reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital and represent the potential volatility of actual losses relative to the established allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments. The analyses for these losses include stress testing that considers alternative economic scenarios as described below.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing credit risk in the Firm's credit portfolio. The stress testing process assesses the potential impact of alternative economic and business scenarios on estimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic scenarios and the underlying parameters are defined centrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic factors and applied across the businesses. The stress test results may indicate credit migration, changes in delinquency trends and potential losses in the credit portfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing processes, management also considers additional stresses outside these scenarios, including industry and countryspecific stress scenarios, as necessary. The Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on setting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as well as to assess the impact of stress on individual counterparties.",

        "page_content": "## Risk monitoring and management\n\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are designed to preserve the independence and integrity of the approval and decision-making process for extending credit so that credit risks are assessed accurately, approved properly, monitored regularly and managed actively at both the transaction and portfolio levels. The policy framework establishes credit approval authorities, concentration limits, risk-rating methodologies, portfolio review parameters and guidelines for management of distressed exposures. In addition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used in evaluating and monitoring credit risk are independently validated by groups that are separate from the LOBs.\n\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and other trends, including any concentrations at the portfolio level, as certain of these trends can be addressed through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management evaluates delinquency and other trends against business expectations, current and forecasted economic conditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and forecasted economic performance and trends are incorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer credit losses and are part of the monitoring of the credit risk profile of the portfolio.\n\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an aggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client and counterparty level with established concentration limits that are reviewed and revised periodically as deemed appropriate by management. Industry and counterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure and economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-based loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty's capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing.\n\nManagement of the Firm's wholesale credit risk exposure is accomplished through a number of means, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Loan underwriting and credit approval processes\n- \u00b7 Loan syndications and participations\n- \u00b7 Loan sales and securitizations\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives\n- \u00b7 Master netting agreements, and\n- \u00b7 Collateral and other risk-reduction techniques\n\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent Credit Review function is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 Independently validating or changing the risk grades assigned to exposures in the Firm's wholesale credit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk grade changes initiated by responsible business units; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the effectiveness of the credit management processes of the LOBs and Corporate, including the adequacy of credit analyses and risk grading/loss given default ('LGD') rationales, proper monitoring and management of credit exposures, and compliance with applicable grading policies and underwriting guidelines.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer and wholesale loans.\n\n## Risk reporting\n\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective decisionmaking, aggregate credit exposure, credit quality forecasts, concentration levels and risk profile changes are reported regularly to senior members of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio reporting of industry, clients, counterparties and customers, product and geography are prepared, and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly basis. Through the risk reporting and governance structure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are provided regularly to, and discussed with, risk committees, senior management and the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Consumer, excluding credit card\n\n## Portfolio analysis\n\nLoans decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by residential real estate loans at fair value and auto and other loans, largely offset by higher retained residential real estate loans.\n\nThe following discussions provide information concerning individual loan products. Refer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, loan modifications and other credit quality indicators.\n\nResidential real estate: The residential real estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.\n\nRetained loans increased compared to December 31, 2021 reflecting originations, net of paydowns. Retained nonaccrual loans decreased from December 31, 2021 reflecting improved credit performance and loan sales. Net recoveries were lower for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower gross charge-offs.\n\nLoans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021, as warehouse loan sales in Home Lending outpaced originations due to higher interest rates and loan sales in CIB outpaced loan purchase activity. Nonaccrual loans at fair value decreased from December 31, 2021 driven by net portfolio activity in CIB.\n\nThe carrying value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $15.7 billion at December 31, 2022. This amount included $5.1 billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and $5.0 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting a material deterioration in their credit risk profile.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were $36.3 billion and $30.0 billion, respectively. These loans have an interest-only payment period generally followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to maturity and are typically originated as higherbalance loans to higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The interest-only residential mortgage loan portfolio reflected net recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022. The credit performance of this portfolio is comparable with the performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm's residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly loans held-forsale and loans at fair value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain potential unrecoverable claim payments related to government-insured loans and considers this exposure in estimating the allowance for loan losses.\n\n| (in millions)                     | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Current                           | $  659               | $  689               |\n| 30-89 days past due               | 136                  | 135                  |\n| 90 or more days past due          | 302                  | 623                  |\n| Total government guaranteed loans | $  1,097             | $  1,447             |\n\n## Geographic composition and current estimated loan-tovalue ratio of residential real estate loans\n\nAt December 31, 2022, $152.7 billion, or 64% of the total retained residential real estate loan portfolio, excluding mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies, were concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois, compared with $145.5 billion, or 65% at December 31, 2021.\n\nAverage current estimated loan-to-value ('LTV') ratios were relatively flat.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for information on the geographic composition and current estimated LTVs of the Firm's residential real estate loans.\n\n## Modified residential real estate loans\n\nThe following table presents information relating to modified retained residential real estate loans for which concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which include both TDRs and modified PCD loans not accounted for as TDRs. The following table does not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions and, therefore, are not TDRs.

The portfolio decreased when compared with December 31, 2021 due to paydowns of scored Auto loans and PPP loan forgiveness in Business Banking predominantly offset by originations of scored Auto loans. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased compared to the prior year due to higher scored Auto and overdraft chargeoffs, as the prior year benefited from government stimulus and payment assistance programs. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were 0.24% and 0.04% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Nonperforming assets\n\nThe following table presents information as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, about consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming assets.\n\n| Nonperforming assets                        | (a)      | (a)      |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| December 31, (in millions)                  | 2022     | 2021     |\n| Nonaccrual loans                            |          |          |\n| Residential real estate (b)                 | $  4,196 | $  5,231 |\n| Auto and other (c)                          | 129      | 119      |\n| Total nonaccrual loans                      | 4,325    | 5,350    |\n| Assets acquired in loan satisfactions       |          |          |\n| Real estate owned                           | 129      | 112      |\n| Other                                       | 28       | 22       |\n| Total assets acquired in loan satisfactions | 157      | 134      |\n| Total nonperforming assets                  | $  4,482 | $  5,484 |\n\n## Nonaccrual loans\n\nThe following table presents changes in consumer, excluding credit card, nonaccrual loans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Nonaccrual loan activity\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Beginning balance                       | $  5,350 | $  6,467 |\n| Additions:                              | 2,196    | 2,956    |\n| Reductions:                             |          |          |\n| Principal payments and other (a)        | 1,393    | 2,018    |\n| Charge-offs                             | 255      | 229      |\n| Returned to performing status           | 1,405    | 1,716    |\n| Foreclosures and other liquidations     | 168      | 110      |\n| Total reductions                        | 3,221    | 4,073    |\n| Net changes                             | (1,025)  | (1,117)  |\n| Ending balance                          | $  4,325 | $  5,350 |\n\n(a) Other reductions include loan sales.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about the consumer credit portfolio, including information about delinquencies, other credit quality indicators, loan modifications and loans that were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.\n\n## Purchased credit deteriorated ('PCD') loans\n\nThe following tables provide credit-related information for PCD loans which are reported in residential real estate.\n\n| (in millions, except ratios)                                            | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Loan delinquency (a)                                                    |                      |                      |\n| Current                                                                 | $  10,910            | $  12,746            |\n| 30-149 days past due                                                    | 347                  | 331                  |\n| 150 or more days past due                                               | 277                  | 664                  |\n| Total PCD loans                                                         | $  11,534            | $  13,741            |\n| % of 30+ days past due to total  retained PCD loans                     | 5.41 %               | 7.24 %               |\n| Nonaccrual loans                                                        | $  1,200             | $  1,616             |\n| Year ended December 31,                    (in millions, except ratios) | 2022                 | 2021                 |\n| Net charge-offs/(recoveries)                                            | $  (11)              | $  15                |\n| Net charge-off/(recovery) rate                                          | (0.09) %             | 0.10 %               |",

        "page_content": "## Credit card\n\nTotal credit card loans increased from December 31, 2021 driven by growth in balances on higher consumer spending and net new originations. The December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%, respectively, increased compared to the December 31, 2021 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.04% and 0.50%, but remain below pre-pandemic levels. Net chargeoffs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the prior year. Delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to benefit from the ongoing financial strength of U.S. consumers. However, median deposit balances declined in the second half of 2022, impacted by the growth in consumer spending.\n\nConsistent with the Firm's policy, all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm's allowance for loan losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income.\n\n## Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans\n\nAt December 31, 2022, $85.4 billion, or 46% of the total retained credit card loan portfolio, was concentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, compared with $70.5 billion, or 46%, at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Modifications of credit card loans\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the Firm had $796 million of credit card loans outstanding that have been modified in TDRs, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2021. These TDRs do not include loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered TDRs.\n\nRefer to Note 12 for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies, geographic and FICO composition, and modifications.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\n\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending, marketmaking, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm's wholesale businesses is generally retained on the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and transaction structure, inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations. Refer to the industry discussion on pages 118-121 for further information.\n\nThe Firm's wholesale credit portfolio includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM, and Corporate, as well as the risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n\nIn 2022, wholesale credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, retained loans increased by $43.3 billion driven by CIB and CB, including higher revolver utilization, partially offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments decreased $14.5 billion, driven by net portfolio activity in CIB, including a decrease in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing portfolio, largely offset by net portfolio activity in AWM and CB.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio remained relatively flat at 70%, while criticized exposure decreased by $6.9 billion from $38.2 billion to $31.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, nonperforming exposure decreased by $406.0 million driven by a decline in lending-related commitments in CIB and loans in AWM as a result of client-specific upgrades, paydowns and cancelled commitments, largely offset by client-specific downgrades in CIB including downgrades to certain Russia and Russia-associated clients in the first quarter of 2022.

Total criticized exposure, excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $31.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and $38.2 billion at December 31, 2021, representing approximately 2.7% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. Criticized exposure decreased driven by net portfolio activity and client-specific upgrades concentrated in Consumer & Retail, Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Real Estate, largely offset by client-specific downgrades. Of the $31.3 billion of criticized exposure at December 31, 2022, approximately half was undrawn and $28.6 billion was performing.\n\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm's exposures as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## Lending-related commitments\n\nThe Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm's expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on wholesale lendingrelated commitments.\n\n## Receivables from customers\n\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients' brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Derivative contracts\n\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives ('ETD'), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter ('OTC-cleared') derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm's OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short\n\nmaturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily was approximately 87% and 88% at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements and further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.\n\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $70.9 billion and $57.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm.\n\nIn addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client's exposure is in the Firm's favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\n\nIn management's view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\n\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client's derivative contracts move in the Firm's favor. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm's use of collateral agreements.\n\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods presented.\n\n## Derivative receivables\n\n| December 31, (in millions)                                                        | 2022      | 2021      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total, net of cash collateral                                                     | $  70,880 | $  57,081 |\n| Liquid securities and other cash  collateral held against derivative  receivables | (23,014)  | (10,102)  |\n| Total, net of liquid securities and  other cash collateral                        | $  47,866 | $  46,979 |\n| Other collateral held against derivative receivables                              | (1,261)   | (1,544)   |\n| Total, net of collateral                                                          | $  46,605 | $  45,435 |",

To capture the potential future variability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates, on a client-by-client basis, three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak, Derivative Risk Equivalent ('DRE'), and Average exposure ('AVG'). These measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\n\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level over the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary measure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for derivative contracts, senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management.\n\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used as an input for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk.\n\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value of the Firm's derivative exposure, including the benefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further described below.\n\nThe fair value of the Firm's derivative receivables incorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of counterparties. CVA is based on the Firm's AVG to a counterparty and the counterparty's credit spread in the credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In addition, the Firm's risk\n\nmanagement process for derivatives exposures takes into consideration the potential impact of wrong-way risk, which is broadly defined as the risk that exposure to a counterparty is positively correlated with the impact of a default by the same counterparty, which could cause exposure to increase at the same time as the counterparty's capacity to meet its obligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence the nature and magnitude of these correlations over time. To the extent that these correlations are identified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated with a particular counterparty's AVG. The Firm risk manages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into credit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and commodity derivative contracts.\n\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm's current derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years as calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The three measures generally show that exposure will decline after the first year, if no new trades are added to the portfolio.\n\n## Exposure profile of derivatives measures\n\n<!-- image -->",

Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below.\n\nThe Firm also uses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain securities held in the Firm's market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit portfolio management activities.\n\n## Credit derivatives and credit-related notes used in credit portfolio management activities\n\n|                                                                                              | Notional amount of  protection  purchased and sold (a)   | Notional amount of  protection  purchased and sold (a)   |     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| December 31, (in millions)                                                                   | 2022                                                     | 2021                                                     |     |\n| Credit derivatives and credit-related notes  used to manage:                                 |                                                          |                                                          |     |\n| Loans and lending-related commitments                                                        | $  6,422                                                 | $  4,138                                                 |     |\n| Derivative receivables                                                                       | 11,721                                                   | 14,573                                                   | (b) |\n| Credit derivatives and credit-related notes  used in credit portfolio management  activities | $  18,143                                                | $  18,711                                                |     |\n\nThe credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these derivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in principal transactions revenue. In contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments being risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual basis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between loans and lending-related commitments and the credit derivatives used in credit portfolio management activities, causes earnings volatility that is not representative, in the Firm's view, of the true changes in value of the Firm's overall credit exposure.\n\nThe effectiveness of credit default swaps ('CDS') as a hedge against the Firm's exposures may vary depending on a number of factors, including the named reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience losses on specific exposures that are different than the named reference entities in the purchased CDS); the contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a defined credit event that does not align with an actual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of the Firm's CDS protection (which in some cases may be shorter than the Firm's exposures). However, the Firm generally seeks to purchase credit protection with a maturity date that is the same or similar to the maturity date of the exposure for which the protection was purchased, and remaining differences in maturity are actively monitored and managed by the Firm.

        "page_content": "## ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's allowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n- \u00b7 the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\n- \u00b7 the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Discussion of changes in the allowance\n\nThe allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 was $22.2 billion , reflecting a net addition of $3.5 billion from December 31, 2021, consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 $2.3 billion in wholesale, driven by deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook and loan growth, predominantly in CB and CIB, and\n- \u00b7 $1.2 billion in consumer, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting higher outstanding balances and deterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction in the allowance related to a decrease in uncertainty associated with borrower behavior as the effects of the pandemic gradually recede.\n\nDeterioration in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook included both updates to the central scenario in the fourth quarter of 2022, which now reflects a mild recession, as well as the impact of the increased weight placed on the adverse scenarios beginning in the first quarter of 2022 due to the effects associated with higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks, including the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Firm's central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n\n|                                 | Assumptions at December 31, 2022   | Assumptions at December 31, 2022   | Assumptions at December 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                 | 2Q23                               | 4Q23                               | 2Q24                               |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 3.8  %                             | 4.3  %                             | 5.0  %                             |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 1.5  %                             | 0.4  %                             | - %                                |\n|                                 | Assumptions at December 31, 2021   | Assumptions at December 31, 2021   | Assumptions at December 31, 2021   |\n|                                 | 2Q22                               | 4Q22                               | 2Q23                               |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 4.2 %                              | 4.0 %                              | 3.9 %                              |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 3.1 %                              | 2.8 %                              | 2.1 %                              |\n\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nInvestment portfolio risk is the risk associated with the loss of principal or a reduction in expected returns on investments arising from the investment securities portfolio or from principal investments. The investment securities portfolio is predominantly held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's balance sheet and asset-liability management objectives. Principal investments are predominantly privately-held financial instruments and are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically intended to be held over extended periods and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-term realized gains with respect to these investments.\n\n## Investment securities risk\n\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure associated with a default in the payment of principal and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly consists of high-quality securities. At December 31, 2022, the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was $629.3 billion, and the average credit rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 79-80 and Note 10 for further information on the investment securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 97-104 for further information on related liquidity risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 131-138 for further information on the market risk inherent in the portfolio.\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firm's Risk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk Committee with regular updates provided to the Board Risk Committee.\n\nThe Firm's independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investment securities in accordance with relevant policies. Approved levels for investment securities are established for each risk category, including capital and credit risks.\n\n## Principal investment risk\n\nPrincipal investments are typically privately-held financial instruments representing ownership interests or other forms of junior capital. In general, principal investments include tax-oriented investments and investments made to enhance or accelerate the Firm's business strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader business strategy. The Firm's principal investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and are reflected within their respective financial results. The Firm's investments will continue to evolve in line with its strategies, including the Firm's commitment to support underserved communities and minority-owned businesses.\n\nThe table below presents the aggregate carrying values of the principal investment portfolios as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n| (in billions)                                                                      | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Tax-oriented investments,  primarily in alternative energy  and affordable housing | $  26.2              | $  23.2              |\n| Private equity, various debt and  equity instruments, and real  assets             | 10.8                 | 7.3                  |\n| Total carrying value                                                               | $  37.0              | $  30.5              |\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Firm's approach to managing principal risk is consistent with the Firm's risk governance structure. The Firm has established a Firmwide risk policy framework for all principal investing activities that includes approval by executives who are independent from the investing businesses, as appropriate.\n\nThe Firm's independent control functions are responsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the carrying value of investments in accordance with relevant policies. As part of the risk governance structure, approved levels for investments are established and monitored for each relevant business or segment in order to manage the overall size of the portfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on these portfolios using specific scenarios that estimate losses based on significant market moves and/or other risk events.",

Market Risk Management is responsible for the following functions:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining a market risk policy framework\n- \u00b7 Independently measuring, monitoring and controlling LOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk\n- \u00b7 Defining, approving and monitoring of limits\n- \u00b7 Performing stress testing and qualitative risk assessments\n\n## Risk measurement\n\n## Measures used to capture market risk\n\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and therefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics, both statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk including:\n\n- \u00b7 Value-at-risk (VaR)\n- \u00b7 Stress testing\n- \u00b7 Profit and loss drawdowns\n- \u00b7 Earnings-at-risk\n- \u00b7 Other sensitivity-based measures\n\n## Risk monitoring and control\n\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a series of limits set in the context of the market environment and business strategy. In setting limits, Market Risk Management takes into consideration factors such as market volatility, product liquidity, accommodation of client business, and management judgment. Market Risk Management maintains different levels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and stress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits include VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented by certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit and loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the LOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity level.\n\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly reviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior management is responsible for reviewing and approving certain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis. Limits that have not been reviewed within specified time periods by Market Risk Management are reported to senior management. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for adhering to established limits against which exposures are monitored and reported.\n\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely manner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk Management and senior management. In the event of a breach, Market Risk Management consults with senior members of appropriate groups within the Firm to determine the suitable course of action required to return the applicable positions to compliance, which may include a reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or granting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate an expected increase in client activity and/or market volatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit breaches are escalated as appropriate.\n\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in market conditions occur. For additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148.\n\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm's existing market risk measures to identify opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly over time.",

        "page_content": "## Value-at-risk\n\nJPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk ('VaR'), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from adverse market moves in the current market environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\n\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. The framework's approach assumes that historical changes in market values are representative of the distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk Management VaR provides a daily measure of risk that is closely aligned to risk management decisions made by the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market risk measures, provides the appropriate information needed to respond to risk events.\n\nThe Firm's Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level. Risk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to measure risk profiles and levels of diversification across product types and is used for aggregating risks and monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results are reported to senior management, the Board of Directors and regulators.\n\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are individual VaR models that simulate historical market returns for individual risk factors and/or product types. To capture material market risks as part of the Firm's risk management framework, comprehensive VaR model calculations are performed daily for businesses whose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR models are granular and incorporate numerous risk factors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market values over the historical period; inputs are selected based on the risk profile of each portfolio, as sensitivities and historical time series used to generate daily market values may be different across product types or risk management systems. The VaR model results across all portfolios are aggregated at the Firm level.\n\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect measure of market risk exposure and potential future losses. In addition, based on their reliance on available historical data, limited time horizons, and other factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in their ability to measure certain risks and to predict losses, particularly those associated with market illiquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market conditions.\n\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not captured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and availability of appropriate historical data. The Firm uses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other products when daily time series are not available. It is likely that using an actual price-based time series for these products, if available, would affect the VaR results presented. The Firm therefore considers other nonstatistical measures such as stress\n\ntesting, in addition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk positions.\n\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be different than the independent third-party data collected for VCG price testing in its monthly valuation process. For example, in cases where market prices are not observable, or where proxies are used in VaR historical time series, the data sources may differ. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for further information on the Firm's valuation process. As VaR model calculations require daily data and a consistent source for valuation, it may not be practical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly valuation process for VaR model calculations.\n\nThe Firm's VaR model calculations are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's portfolios, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's modeling techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 148 for information regarding model reviews and approvals.\n\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with regulatory rules ('Regulatory VaR'), which is used to derive the Firm's regulatory VaR-based capital requirements under Basel III capital rules. This Regulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten business-day holding period and an expected tail loss methodology which approximates a 99% confidence level. Regulatory VaR is applied to 'covered' positions as defined by Basel III capital rules, which may be different than the positions included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR. For example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans are included in the Firm's Risk Management VaR, while Regulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative hedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm's Risk Management VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the diversification benefit for certain VaR models.\n\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase's Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm's website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).",

The increase was driven by the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market observed in March 2022 impacting Credit Portfolio VaR, predominantly offset by a decrease in Corporate and other LOB VaR.\n\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the four trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.\n\n## Daily Risk Management VaR\n\n<!-- image -->",

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm's reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\n\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm's Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 136 of the 259 days, and observed 17 VaR backtesting exceptions. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted losses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of certain components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue, refer to pages 70-71.\n\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12 months and three months ended December 31, 2022. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm's Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm's covered positions.\n\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\n\n<!-- image -->",

While VaR reflects the risk of loss due to adverse changes in markets using recent historical market behavior, stress testing reflects the risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the value of market risk sensitive positions applied simultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm's vulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but possible economic and market scenarios. The results are used to understand the exposures responsible for those potential losses and are measured against limits.\n\nThe Firm's stress framework covers market risk sensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The framework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of potential stress for both market rallies and market sell-offs, assuming significant changes in market factors such as credit spreads, equity prices, interest rates, currency rates and commodity prices, and combines them in multiple ways to capture an array of hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\n\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on tail events in specific asset classes and geographies, including how the event may impact multiple market factors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate specific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk between different products. The flexibility in the stress framework allows the Firm to construct new scenarios that can test the outcomes against possible future stress events. Stress testing results are reported periodically to senior management of the Firm, as appropriate.\n\nStress scenarios are governed by the overall stress framework, under the oversight of Market Risk Management, and the models to calculate the stress results are subject to the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy. The Firmwide Market Risk Stress Methodology Committee reviews and approves changes to stress testing methodology and scenarios across the Firm. Significant changes to the framework are escalated to senior management, as appropriate.\n\nThe Firm's stress testing framework is utilized in calculating the Firm's CCAR and other stress test results, which are reported periodically to the Board of Directors. In addition, stress testing results are incorporated into the Firm's Risk Appetite framework, and are reported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\n\n## Profit and loss drawdowns\n\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight trading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance. A profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue from its year-to-date peak level.\n\n## Earnings-at-risk\n\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm's reported net income is important as interest rate risk represents one of the Firm's significant market risks. Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities but also from the\n\nFirm's traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt and the investment securities portfolio. Refer to the table on page 132 for a summary by LOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\n\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm's structural interest rate risk policy and related limits, which are subject to approval by the Board Risk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm's structural interest rate risk profile and reviews it with senior management, including the CTC Risk Committee. In addition, oversight of structural interest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk function reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function is responsible for providing independent oversight and governance around assumptions and establishing and monitoring limits for structural interest rate risk. The Firm manages structural interest rate risk generally through its investment securities portfolio and interest rate derivatives.\n\nStructural interest rate risk can arise due to a variety of factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Differences in timing among the maturity or repricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments\n- \u00b7 Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments that are maturing or repricing at the same time\n- \u00b7 Differences in the amounts by which short-term and longterm market interest rates change (for example, changes in the slope of the yield curve)\n- \u00b7 The impact of changes in the maturity of various assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments as interest rates change\n\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide basis. Business units transfer their interest rate risk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer pricing, which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets. These elements include asset and liability balances and contractual rates of interest, contractual principal payment schedules, expected prepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and maturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products.\n\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm's interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies ('non-U.S. dollar' currencies). These simulations primarily include retained loans,",

These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and longterm rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.\n- \u00b7 Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the reversal of Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and require management judgment. Therefore, the actual amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve may take as part of monetary policy, including through the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In addition, there are other factors that impact the amount of deposits held at the Firm such as the level of loans across the industry and competition for deposits.\n- \u00b7 The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. The deposit rates paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.\n\nThe Firm's earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm's balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm's simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits in its earnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating repricing lags, in the current environment, would significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios expected to result in a positive impact, and lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a negative impact, on the Firm's earnings-at-risk. While a relevant measure of the\n\nFirm's interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the Firm's net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 49 for additional information).\n\nThe Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n\n| December 31, (in billions)         | 2022     | 2021   |     |\n|------------------------------------|----------|--------|-----|\n| Parallel shift:                    |          |        |     |\n| +100 bps shift in rates            | $  (2.0) | $  5.0 |     |\n| -100 bps shift in rates            | 2.4      | NM     | (a) |\n| Steeper yield curve:               |          |        |     |\n| +100 bps shift in long-term rates  | 0.8      | 1.8    |     |\n| -100 bps shift in short-term rates | 3.2      | NM     | (a) |\n| Flatter yield curve:               |          |        |     |\n| +100 bps shift in short-term rates | (2.8)    | 3.2    |     |\n| -100 bps shift in long-term rates  | (0.9)    | NM     | (a) |\n\nThe change in the Firm's U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021 reflected updates to the Firm's baseline for higher interest rates and higher corresponding modeled deposit betas, as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's balance sheet.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm's sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points parallel and short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to the impact of assets repricing, while a +/-100 basis points shift in long-term rates is primarily the result of a greater impact from assets repricing compared to the impact of liabilities repricing.\n\nThe Firm's non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.\n\n| December 31, (in billions)         | 2022     | 2021   |     |\n|------------------------------------|----------|--------|-----|\n| Parallel shift:                    |          |        |     |\n| +100 bps shift in rates            | $  0.7   | $  0.8 |     |\n| -100 bps shift in rates            | $  (0.6) | NM     | (a) |\n| Steeper yield curve:               |          |        |     |\n| -100 bps shift in short-term rates | $  (0.6) | NM     | (a) |\n| Flatter yield curve:               |          |        |     |\n| +100 bps shift in short-term rates | 0.6      | 0.8    |     |\n\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis points and short-term rates staying at current levels were not material to the Firm's earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021.",

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm's exposures are diversified given the Firm's strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk management function that assesses, manages and monitors exposure to country risk across the Firm.\n\nThe Firm's country risk management function includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining policies, procedures and standards consistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\n- \u00b7 Assigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks and establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\n- \u00b7 Measuring and monitoring country risk exposure and stress across the Firm\n- \u00b7 Managing and approving country limits and reporting trends and limit breaches to senior management\n- \u00b7 Developing surveillance tools, such as signaling models and ratings indicators, for early identification of potential country risk concerns\n- \u00b7 Providing country risk scenario analysis\n\n## Sources and measurement\n\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its lending and deposits, investing, and market-making activities, whether cross-border or locally funded. Country exposure includes activity with both government and private-sector entities in a country.\n\nUnder the Firm's internal country risk management approach, attribution of exposure to an individual country is based on the country where the largest proportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor are located or where the largest proportion of its revenue is derived, which may be different than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or country of incorporation.\n\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of the Firm's risk to an immediate default, with zero recovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or guarantors attributed to that country. Activities which result in contingent or indirect exposure to a country are not included in the country exposure measure (for example, providing clearing services or secondary exposure to collateral on securities financing receivables).\n\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the measurement and allocation of country exposure, particularly in the case of certain non-linear or index products, or where the nature of the counterparty, issuer, obligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution to an\n\nindividual country. The use of different measurement approaches or assumptions could affect the amount of reported country exposure.\n\nUnder the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework:\n\n- \u00b7 Deposits with banks are measured as the cash balances placed with central banks, commercial banks, and other financial institutions\n- \u00b7 Lending exposures are measured at the total committed amount (funded and unfunded), net of the allowance for credit losses and eligible cash and marketable securities collateral received\n- \u00b7 Securities financing exposures are measured at their receivable balance, net of eligible collateral received\n- \u00b7 Debt and equity securities are measured at the fair value of all positions, including both long and short positions\n- \u00b7 Counterparty exposure on derivative receivables is measured at the derivative's fair value, net of the fair value of the eligible collateral received\n- \u00b7 Credit derivatives exposure is measured at the net notional amount of protection purchased or sold for the same underlying reference entity, inclusive of the fair value of the derivative receivable or payable, reflecting the manner in which the Firm manages these exposures\n\nThe Firm's internal country risk reporting differs from the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank regulatory requirements.",

Country Risk Management periodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of countries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and geopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as necessary.\n\n## Risk reporting\n\nCountry exposure and stress are measured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends and monitor high usages and breaches against limits.\n\nFor country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions that are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions ('SAR') and dependent territories, separately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm's top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2022, and their comparative exposures as of December 31, 2021. The selection of countries represents the Firm's largest total exposures by individual country, based on the Firm's internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm's view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to client activity and market flows.\n\nThe increase in exposure to Germany and the decrease in exposure to the U.K. were primarily due to changes in cash placements with the central banks of those countries driven by balance sheet and liquidity management activities.\n\nThe decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by reductions in cash placed with the central bank of Australia and government debt securities, due to client-driven market-making activities and lower client cash deposits resulting from higher interest rates.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of clients, largely at the Russian National Settlement Depository. In accordance with requirements of the Bank of Russia, these deposits were transferred to the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia on February 3, 2023.\n\n## Top 20 country exposures (excluding the U.S.) (a)\n\n| December 31,   (in billions)   | 2022                      | 2022                | 2022                        | 2022      | 2022                 | 2021 (f)        |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|\n|                                | Deposits  with  banks (b) | Lending (c)         | Trading  and  investing (d) | Other (e) | Total  exposure      | Total  exposure |\n| Germany                        |                           | $  79.5  $  11.3  $ |                             |           | 1.9  $  0.5  $  93.2 | $  61.7         |\n| United  Kingdom                | 30.8                      | 23.0                | 14.5                        | 1.8       | 70.1                 | 96.4            |\n| Japan                          | 48.2                      | 3.1                 | 4.2                         | 0.3       | 55.8                 | 45.5            |\n| Australia                      | 15.9                      | 6.2                 | 3.6                         | -         | 25.7                 | 39.1            |\n| France                         | 0.4                       | 11.4                | 2.6                         | 3.7       | 18.1                 | 14.0            |\n| Brazil                         | 4.2                       | 4.9                 | 8.7                         | -         | 17.8                 | 12.0            |\n| Switzerland                    | 8.8                       | 3.3                 | 1.6                         | 1.6       | 15.3                 | 20.9            |\n| Canada                         | 2.6                       | 10.2                | 1.5                         | 0.1       | 14.4                 | 16.9            |\n| China                          | 2.5                       | 5.7                 | 5.5                         | -         | 13.7                 | 18.6            |\n| South Korea                    | 1.4                       | 3.5                 | 4.9                         | 0.2       | 10.0                 | 8.7             |\n| Singapore                      | 1.2                       | 4.6                 | 3.7                         | 0.4       | 9.9                  | 12.3            |\n| Belgium                        | 6.3                       | 1.7                 | 1.2                         | -         | 9.2                  | 6.8             |\n| India                          | 1.3                       | 4.0                 | 2.8                         | 0.9       | 9.0                  | 14.7            |\n| Saudi Arabia                   | 0.7                       | 5.6                 | 1.6                         | -         | 7.9                  | 9.1             |\n| Netherlands                    | 0.2                       | 7.2                 | (0.8)                       | 0.5       | 7.1                  | 6.8             |\n| Spain                          | 0.4                       | 4.9                 | 0.5                         | -         | 5.8                  | 10.1            |\n| Mexico                         | 0.5                       | 4.4                 | 0.5                         | -         | 5.4                  | 4.9             |\n| Luxembourg                     | 0.9                       | 2.9                 | 1.5                         | -         | 5.3                  | 11.5            |\n| Hong Kong  SAR                 | 2.8                       | 0.9                 | 0.7                         | 0.1       | 4.5                  | 5.9             |\n| Sweden                         | 1.1                       | 3.1                 | 0.2                         | -         | 4.4                  | 4.4             |",

Climate change is viewed as a driver of risk that may impact existing types of risks managed by the Firm. Climate risk is categorized into physical risk and transition risk.\n\nPhysical risk refers to economic costs and financial loss associated with a changing climate. Acute physical risk drivers include the increased frequency or severity of climate and weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms. Chronic physical risk drivers include more gradual shifts in the climate, such as rising sea levels, persistent changes in precipitation levels and increases in average ambient temperatures.\n\nTransition risk refers to the financial and economic implications associated with a societal adjustment to a lowcarbon economy. Transition risk drivers include possible changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies and shifts in consumer preferences. Transition risks may also be influenced by changes in the physical climate.\n\n## Organization and management\n\nThe Firm has a Climate Risk Management function that is responsible for establishing the Firmwide framework and strategy for managing climate risk. The Climate Risk Management function engages across the Firm to help integrate climate risk considerations into existing risk management frameworks, as appropriate.\n\nOther responsibilities of Climate Risk Management include:\n\n- \u00b7 Setting policies, standards, procedures and processes to support identification, escalation, monitoring and management of climate risk across the Firm\n- \u00b7 Developing metrics, scenarios, and stress testing mechanisms designed to assess the range of potential climate-related financial and economic impacts to the Firm\n- \u00b7 Establishing a Firmwide climate risk data strategy and the supporting climate risk technology infrastructure\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the identification, assessment and management of climate risks present in their business activities and for adherence to applicable climate-related laws, rules and regulations.\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nThe Firm's approach to managing climate risk is consistent with the Firm's risk governance structure. The LOBs and Corporate are responsible for integrating climate risk management into existing governance frameworks, or creating new governance frameworks, as appropriate.\n\nThe LOBs, Corporate and Climate Risk Management are responsible for providing the Board Risk Committee with information on significant climate risks and climate-related initiatives, as appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\n## OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nOperational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems; human factors; or external events impacting the Firm's processes or systems. Operational Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and estimations and model risk. Operational risk is inherent in the Firm's activities and can manifest itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts, business disruptions (including those caused by extraordinary events beyond the Firm's control), cyber attacks, inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations or failure of vendors or other third party providers to perform in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light of the Firm's financial position, the characteristics of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory environments in which it operates.\n\n## Operational Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Firm's Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk ('CCOR') Management Framework is designed to enable the Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage and report on the Firm's operational risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Governance\n\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the management of operational risk. The Control Management Organization, which consists of control managers within each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the day-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework.\n\nThe Firm's Global Chief Compliance Officer ('CCO') and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite is responsible for defining the CCOR Management Framework and establishing the minimum standards for its execution. The LOB and Corporate aligned CCOR Lead Officers report to the Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite and are independent of the respective businesses or functions they oversee. The CCOR Management Framework is included in the Risk Governance and Oversight Policy that is reviewed and approved by the Board Risk Committee periodically.\n\n## Operational Risk Identification\n\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control selfassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and Corporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and Corporate evaluate the effectiveness of their respective control environment to assess where controls have failed, and to determine where remediation efforts may be required. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance organization ('Operational Risk and Compliance') provides oversight of and challenge to these evaluations and may also perform independent assessments of significant operational risk events and areas of concentrated or emerging risk.\n\n## Operational Risk Measurement\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs an independent assessment of the operational risks inherent within the LOBs and Corporate, which includes evaluating the effectiveness of the control environments and reporting the results to senior management.\n\nIn addition, Operational Risk and Compliance assesses operational risks through quantitative means, including operational risk-based capital and estimation of operational risk losses under both baseline and stressed conditions.\n\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital estimate is the Loss Distribution Approach ('LDA') statistical model, which simulates the frequency and severity of future operational risk loss projections based on historical data. The LDA model is used to estimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a one-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level. The LDA model incorporates actual internal operational risk losses in the quarter following the period in which those losses were realized, and the calculation generally continues to reflect such losses even after the issues or business activities giving rise to the losses have been remediated or reduced.\n\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the Firm's operational risk-based capital methodology, which uses the Advanced Measurement Approach ('AMA'), incorporates internal and external losses as well as management's view of tail risk captured through operational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of key business environment and internal control metrics. The Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in its AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\n\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic conditions on operational risk losses and develops a forward looking view of material operational risk events that may occur in a stressed environment. The Firm's operational risk stress testing framework is utilized in calculating results for the Firm's CCAR and other stress testing processes.\n\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 for information related to operational risk RWA, and CCAR.\n\n## Operational Risk Monitoring and testing\n\nThe results of risk assessments performed by Operational Risk and Compliance are used in connection with their independent monitoring and testing compliance of the LOBs and Corporate with laws, rules and regulations. Through monitoring and testing, Operational Risk and Compliance independently identify areas of heightened operational risk and tests the effectiveness of controls within the LOBs and Corporate.",

        "page_content": "## Management of Operational Risk\n\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified through monitoring and testing are escalated to the LOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action plans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk. Operational Risk and Compliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the development and implementation of action plans.\n\n## Operational Risk Reporting\n\nAll employees of the Firm are expected to escalate risks appropriately. Risks identified by Operational Risk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate LOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed. Operational Risk and Compliance has established standards designed to ensure that consistent operational risk reporting and operational risk reports are produced on a Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate. Reporting includes the evaluation of key risk and performance indicators against established thresholds as well as the assessment of different types of operational risk against stated risk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation protocols to senior management and to the Board of Directors.\n\n## Subcategories and examples of operational risks\n\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways. Operational risk subcategories include Compliance risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and Model risk. Refer to pages 145, 146, 147 and 148, respectively for more information on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and Estimations and Model risk. Details on other select examples of operational risks such as cybersecurity, business and technology resiliency, payment fraud and third-party outsourcing are provided below.\n\n## War in Ukraine and Sanctions\n\nIn response to the war in Ukraine, numerous financial and economic sanctions have been imposed on Russia and Russia-associated entities and individuals by various governments around the world, including the authorities in the U.S., U.K. and EU. These sanctions are complex and continue to evolve. The Firm continues to face increased operational risk associated with addressing these complex compliance-related matters. To manage this increased risk, the Firm has implemented controls reasonably designed to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and to prevent dealing with sanctioned persons or in property subject to sanctions, as well as to block or restrict payments as required by the applicable regulations.\n\n## Cybersecurity risk\n\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm's exposure to harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of technology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is an important and continuously evolving focus for the Firm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting and enhancing the security of computer systems, software, networks, storage devices, and other technology assets. The Firm's security efforts are designed to protect against, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by unauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to confidential information, destroy data,\n\ndisrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage.\n\nThe Firm has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience, a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions. The Firm has implemented precautionary measures and controls reasonably designed to address this increased risk, such as enhanced threat monitoring. There can be no assurance that the measures taken by the Firm will be successful in defending against cyber attacks.\n\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to potential new threats as well as expanded regulatory scrutiny including the introduction of new cybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make significant investments in enhancing its cyber defense capabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies and other businesses in order to understand the full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the operating environment, enhance defenses and improve resiliency against cybersecurity threats. The Firm actively participates in discussions and simulations of cybersecurity risks both internally and with law enforcement, government officials, peer and industry groups, and has significantly increased efforts to educate employees and certain clients on the topic of cybersecurity risks.\n\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or that facilitate the Firm's business activities (e.g., vendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses, central depositories, and financial intermediaries) are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm. Third party cybersecurity incidents such as system breakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of such parties, or cyber attacks, including ransomware and supply-chain compromises, could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or result in lost or compromised information of the Firm or its clients. Clients are also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm and its information assets, particularly when their activities and systems are beyond the Firm's own security and control systems. As a result, the Firm engages in regular and ongoing discussions with certain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity risks and opportunities to improve security. However, where cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of client failures to maintain the security of their own systems and processes, clients are responsible for losses incurred.\n\nTo help safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the Firm's infrastructure, resources and information, the Firm maintains a Information Security Program designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks. The Board of Directors is periodically provided with updates on the Firm's Information Security Program, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies and practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as well as the Firm's efforts regarding significant cybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a cybersecurity incident response",

Among other key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate the risk of insider trading connected to a cybersecurity incident, and includes various escalation points.\n\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls organization, working with each of the Firm's LOBs and Corporate, is responsible for identifying technology and cybersecurity risks and is responsible for the controls to manage threats. The organization consists of business aligned information security personnel that are supported within the organization by the following products and services that execute the Information Security Program for the Firm:\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber Operations\n- \u00b7 Identity & Access Management\n- \u00b7 Governance, Risk & Controls\n- \u00b7 Global Technology Product Security\n\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Controls governance structure is designed to identify, escalate, and mitigate information security risks. This structure uses key governance forums to disseminate information and monitor technology efforts. These forums are established at multiple levels throughout the Firm. The forums are used to escalate information security risks or other matters as appropriate.\n\nThe IRM function provides oversight of the activities designed to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate cybersecurity risk.\n\nThe Firm's Security Awareness Program includes training that reinforces the Firm's Information Technology Risk and Security Management policies, standards and practices, as well as the expectation that employees comply with these policies. The Security Awareness Program engages personnel through training on how to identify potential cybersecurity risks and protect the Firm's resources and information. This training is mandatory for all employees globally on a periodic basis, and it is supplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives, including periodic phishing tests. The Firm provides specialized security training for certain employee roles such as application developers. Finally, the Firm's Global Privacy Program requires all employees to take periodic awareness training on data privacy. This privacy-focused training includes information about confidentiality and security, as well as responding to unauthorized access to or use of information.\n\n## Business and technology resiliency risk\n\nDisruptions can occur due to forces beyond the Firm's control such as the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or telecommunications loss, failure of a third party to provide expected services, cyberattacks and terrorism. The Firmwide Business Resiliency Program is designed to enable the Firm to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions including occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff, technology, facilities and third parties). The program includes governance, awareness training, planning and testing of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business interruption and public safety risks.\n\n## Payment fraud risk\n\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and internal parties unlawfully obtaining personal monetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise improper payment. The Firm employs various controls for managing payment fraud risk as well as providing employee and client education and awareness trainings.\n\n## Third-party outsourcing risk\n\nThe Firm's Third-Party Oversight ('TPO') and Inter-affiliates Oversight ('IAO') frameworks assist the LOBs and Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding, monitoring and managing their supplier relationships including services provided by affiliates. The objectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers and other third parties to a high level of operational performance and to mitigate key risks, including data loss and business disruptions. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group is responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring, reporting and standards.\n\n## Insurance\n\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be mitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm. The Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers and maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park Assurance Company. Insurance may also be required by third parties with whom the Firm does business.",

        "page_content": "## COMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the risk of failing to comply with laws, rules, regulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-regulatory organizations.\n\n## Overview\n\nEach of the LOBs and Corporate hold primary ownership of and accountability for managing their compliance risk. The Firm's Operational Risk and Compliance Organization ('Operational Risk and Compliance'), which is independent of the LOBs and Corporate, provides independent review, monitoring and oversight of business operations with a focus on compliance with the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the delivery of the Firm's products and services to clients and customers.\n\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations varying across the LOBs and Corporate, and jurisdictions, and include risks related to financial products and services, relationships and interactions with clients and customers, and employee activities. For example, compliance risks include those associated with anti-money laundering compliance, trading activities, market conduct, and complying with the laws, rules, and regulations related to the offering of products and services across jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also inherent in the Firm's fiduciary activities, including the failure to exercise the applicable standard of care to act in the best interest of fiduciary clients and customers or to treat fiduciary clients and customers fairly.\n\nOther functions provide oversight of significant regulatory obligations that are specific to their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies and standards designed to govern, identify, measure, monitor and test, manage, and report on compliance risk.\n\n## Governance and oversight\n\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm's Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite.\n\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its compliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR Management Framework. The Firm's Global CCO and FRE for Operational Risk and Qualitative Risk Appetite also provides regular updates to the Board Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on significant compliance risk issues, as appropriate.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the 'Code') that sets forth the Firm's expectation that employees will conduct themselves with integrity at all times and provides the principles that govern employee conduct with clients, customers, shareholders and one another, as well as with the markets and communities in which the Firm does business. The Code requires employees to promptly report any potential or actual violation of the Code, any Firm policy, or any law or regulation applicable to the Firm's business. It also requires employees to report any illegal conduct, or conduct that violates the underlying principles of the Code, by any of the Firm's employees, clients, customers, suppliers, contract workers, business partners, or agents. Training is assigned to newly hired employees upon joining the Firm, and to current employees periodically on an ongoing basis. Employees are required to affirm their compliance with the Code annually.\n\nEmployees can report any potential or actual violations of the Code through the Firm's Conduct Hotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is anonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions where laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is available at all times globally, with translation services. It is administered by an outside service provider. The Code prohibits retaliation against anyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith. Periodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on the Code of Conduct program.",

The estimation methods are of varying levels of sophistication and are used for many purposes, such as the valuation of positions and measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital requirements, conducting stress testing, evaluating the allowance for credit losses and making business decisions. A dedicated independent function, Model Risk Governance and Review ('MRGR'), defines and governs the Firm's policies relating to the management of model risk and risks associated with certain analytical and judgment-based estimations, such as those used in risk management, budget forecasting and capital planning and analysis.\n\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based estimations within MRGR's scope follows a consistent approach which is used for models, as described in detail below.\n\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models within the Firm based on the specific purposes of such models. Users and developers of models are responsible for developing, implementing and testing their models, as well as referring models to MRGR for review and approval. Once models have been approved, model users and developers are responsible for maintaining a robust operating environment, and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing basis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance models in response to changes in the portfolios and in product and market developments, as well as to capture improvements in available modeling techniques and systems capabilities.\n\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard according to their complexity, the exposure associated with the model and the Firm's reliance on the model. This tiering is subject to the approval of MRGR. In its review of a model, MRGR considers whether the model is suitable for the specific purposes for which it will be used. When reviewing a model, MRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and the reasonableness of model assumptions, and may perform or require additional testing, including back-testing of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved by the appropriate level of management within MRGR based on the relevant model tier.\n\nUnder the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to their use. In certain circumstances, exceptions may be granted to the Firm's policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\n\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the market or economic environment. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as the Firm experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that the Firm may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 and Note 2 for a summary of model-based valuations and other valuation techniques.",

        "page_content": "## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\n\nJPMorgan Chase's accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to understanding its reported results. The Firm's most complex accounting estimates require management's judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm's critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),\n- \u00b7 The allowance for lending-related commitments, and\n- \u00b7 The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm's policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm's allowance for credit losses.\n\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm's allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm's methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables ('MEVs') that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\n\n- \u00b7 Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates, HPI and U.S. real GDP.\n\n- \u00b7 Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real estate prices and HPI.\n\nChanges in the Firm's assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.\n\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.\n\nFor example, compared to the Firm's central scenario shown on page 127 and in Note 13 , the Firm's relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eightquarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3.1% lower at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023; and lower national HPI with a peak difference of approximately 8.4% in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The allowance as of December 31, 2022, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n- \u00b7 The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes in macroeconomic variables.\n- \u00b7 Expectations of future changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior can significantly affect the allowance for credit losses.\n\nTo demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the",

        "page_content": "## Management's discussion and analysis\n\nFirm compared the modeled estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative components of the Firm's allowance for credit losses, the comparison between these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect the following differences:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase of approximately $500 million for residential real estate loans and lending-related commitments\n- \u00b7 An increase of approximately $2.2 billion for credit card loans\n- \u00b7 An increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale loans and lending-related commitments\n\nThis analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential changes in other adjustments to the quantitative calculation, which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and conditions.\n\nRecognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its process to consider the available information and associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## Fair value\n\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, structured note products and certain securities financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home equity and other loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\n\n## Assets measured at fair value\n\nThe following table includes the Firm's assets measured at fair value and the portion of such assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

    {
        "page_content": "## Valuation\n\nDetails of the Firm's processes for determining fair value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.\n\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm's creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.\n\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm's valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually. The Firm's process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing is described in Note 15.\n\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing goodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of December 31, 2022. For each of the reporting units, fair value exceeded carrying value by at least 10% and there was no indication of a significant risk of goodwill impairment based on current projections and valuations.\n\nThe projections for the Firm's reporting units are consistent with management's current business outlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firm's best estimates of longterm growth and return on equity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm uses third-party and peer data to benchmark its assumptions and estimates.\n\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on goodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Credit card rewards liability\n\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various rewards programs which allow cardholders to earn rewards points based on their account activity and the terms and conditions of the rewards program. Generally, there are no limits on the points that an eligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points expire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety of rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form of account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm maintains a rewards liability which represents the estimated cost of rewards points earned and expected to be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is accrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is reduced when the cardholder redeems points. This liability was $11.3 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. The increase in the liability was driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on increased cardholder spending and promotional offers outpacing redemptions throughout 2022.\n\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate ('RR') and cost per point ('CPP') assumptions. The RR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by customers that will be redeemed over the life of the account. The CPP assumption is used to estimate the cost of future point redemptions. These assumptions are evaluated periodically considering historical actuals, cardholder redemption behavior and management judgment. Updates",

As of December 31, 2022, a combined increase of 25 basis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would increase the rewards liability by approximately $315 million.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which it operates, including U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be subject to different interpretations. To determine the financial statement impact of accounting for income taxes, including the provision for income tax expense and unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must make assumptions and judgments about how to interpret and apply these complex tax laws to numerous transactions and business events, as well as make judgments regarding the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income in the U.S. and non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\n\nJPMorgan Chase's interpretations of tax laws around the world are subject to review and examination by the various taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where the Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding its view on a tax position. These disputes over interpretations with the various taxing authorities may be settled by audit, administrative appeals or adjudication in the court systems of the tax jurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan Chase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed additional income taxes as a result of the resolution of these matters, and the Firm records additional unrecognized tax benefits, as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may revise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in income tax laws, legal interpretations, and business strategies. It is possible that revisions in the Firm's estimate of income taxes may materially affect the Firm's results of operations in any reporting period.\n\nDeferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in management's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not . Deferred taxes are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized within the provision for income taxes in the period enacted.\n\nThe Firm has also recognized deferred tax assets in connection with certain tax attributes, including net operating loss ('NOL') carryforwards and foreign tax credit ('FTC') carryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to ascertain whether its deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include management's estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income , including foreign source income, and may incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to utilize NOLs and FTCs before they expire. In connection with these reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax asset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is\n\nestablished. The valuation allowance may be reversed in a subsequent reporting period if the Firm determines that, based on revised estimates of future taxable income or changes in tax planning strategies, it is more likely than not that all or part of the deferred tax asset will become realizable. As of December 31, 2022, management has determined it is more likely than not that the Firm will realize its deferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation allowance.\n\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as necessary when new information becomes available, including changes in tax law and regulations, and interactions with taxing authorities. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that management believes is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is possible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase's unrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact on its effective income tax rate in the period in which the reassessment occurs. Although the Firm believes that its estimates are reasonable, the final tax amount could be different from the amounts reflected in the Firm's income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final outcome of these amounts is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will generally impact the Firm's provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made.\n\nThe Firm's provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. The current and deferred tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known, which could impact the Firm's effective tax rate.\n\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income taxes.\n\n## Litigation reserves\n\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant estimates and judgments associated with establishing litigation reserves.",

These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as 'anticipate,' 'target,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'intend,' 'plan,' 'goal,' 'believe,' or other words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide JPMorgan Chase's current expectations or forecasts of future events, circumstances, results or aspirations. JPMorgan Chase's disclosures in this 2022 Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its other documents filed or furnished with the SEC.

('JPMorgan Chase' or the 'Firm') is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Firm's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by JPMorgan Chase's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('U.S. GAAP').\n\nJPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Firm's assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being made only in accordance with authorizations of JPMorgan Chase's management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Firm's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making the assessment, management used the 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' ('COSO 2013') promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ('COSO').\n\nBased upon the assessment performed, management concluded that as of December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase's internal control over financial reporting was effective based upon the COSO 2013 framework. Additionally, based upon management's assessment, the Firm determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n\nJames Dimon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJeremy Barnum Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFebruary 21, 2023",

We also have audited the Firm's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Firm maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nThe Firm's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Firm's consolidated financial statements and on the Firm's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.",

        "page_content": "## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAllowance for Loan Losses - Portfolio-based component of Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\n\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for loan losses for the portfoliobased component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios was $17.0 billion on total portfolio-based retained loans of $785.9 billion at December 31, 2022. The Firm's allowance for loan losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's loan portfolios and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-based component of the Firm's allowance for loan losses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan portfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of expected credit losses over the expected life of the loan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors applied are determined based on the weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take into consideration the Firm's economic outlook as derived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the most significant of which are U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the allowance for loan losses for the portfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in the forecast of macroeconomic variables, specifically U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as the Firm's forecasts of economic conditions significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the quantitative calculation utilized in their credit loss estimates and the adjustments to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in\n\nevaluating audit evidence obtained relating to the credit loss estimates and the appropriateness of the adjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Firm's allowance for loan losses, including controls over model validation and generation of macroeconomic scenarios. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for estimating the allowance for loan losses, which involved (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the models and methodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S. unemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management's adjustments to the quantitative output for the impacts of model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss estimate. These procedures also included the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of certain models, methodologies and macroeconomic variables .\n\n## Fair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\n\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Firm carries $1.1 trillion of its assets and $453.7 billion of its liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Included in these balances are $13.6 billion of trading assets and $37.8 billion of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, collectively financial instruments, which are classified as level 3 as they contain one or more inputs to valuation which are unobservable and significant to their fair value measurement. The Firm utilized internally developed valuation models and unobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the level 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs used by management to estimate the fair value of certain of these financial instruments include volatility relating to interest rates, correlation relating to interest rates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange rates, and Bermudan switch values.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value of certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment and estimation by management in determining the inputs to estimate fair value, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the fair value of these financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 1 - Basis of presentation\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. ('JPMorgan Chase' or the 'Firm'), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm's business segments.\n\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities.\n\nCertain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nAssets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity.\n\n## Voting interest entities\n\nVoting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations. For these types of entities, the Firm's determination of whether it has a controlling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities' voting equity interests, or through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm.\n\nInvestments in companies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a majority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting, or (ii) at fair value if the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue.\n\nCertain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or managing member, but the nonaffiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general partner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-affiliated partners or members\n\nhave rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not consolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or members do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and consolidates the funds if the Firm is the general partner or managing member and has both power and a potentially significant interest.\n\nThe Firm's investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and privatelyheld entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These investments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage of equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded in other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the accounting under such specialized investment company guidelines.\n\n## Variable interest entities\n\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity's operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.\n\nThe most common type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain assets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company selling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal documents that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE's investors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate investors from claims on the SPE's assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of the assets.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nTo assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment",

        "page_content": "includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers, or owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE's assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.\n\nTo assess whether the Firm has the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE's capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the Firm.\n\nThe Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority votinginterest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm's involvement with a VIE cause the Firm's consolidation conclusion to change.\n\nRefer to Note 14 for further discussion of the Firm's VIEs.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Interest income\n\nThe Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and other debt instruments, generally on a levelyield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7 for further information.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nJPMorgan Chase recognizes noninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset management administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm's related performance obligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm's revenue from contracts with customers.\n\n## Principal transactions revenue\n\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions revenue.\n\n## Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nJPMorgan Chase revalues assets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates.\n\nGains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to nonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Offsetting assets and liabilities\n\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.\n\nThe Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty that permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a single payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination rights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the positive values of 'in the money' transactions are netted against the negative values of 'out of the money' transactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i) all transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are calculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of transactions also often contain a collateral/margin agreement that provides for a security interest in, or title transfer of, securities or cash collateral/margin to the party that has the right to demand margin (the 'demanding party'). The collateral/margin agreement typically requires a party to transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party with a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit on a net basis across all transactions governed by the master netting agreement, less any threshold. The collateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding party, upon default by the counterparty, the right to set-off any amounts payable by the counterparty against any posted collateral or the cash equivalent of any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the demanding party the right to liquidate collateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an amount payable by the counterparty.\n\nRefer to Note 5 for further discussion of the Firm's derivative instruments. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the Firm's securities financing agreements.\n\n## Statements of cash flows\n\nFor JPMorgan Chase's Consolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined as those amounts included in cash and due from banks and deposits with banks on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2023\n\n## Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings ('TDRs')\n\nThe adoption of this guidance eliminates the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow ('DCF') methodology, and allows the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the postmodification effective interest rate, instead of the premodification effective interest rate.\n\nThe Firm elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except modified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF methodology. See Note 13 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance approach.\n\nThis guidance was adopted on January 1, 2023 under the modified retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit losses of approximately $600 million and an increase to retained earnings of approximately $450 million, after-tax predominantly driven by residential real estate and credit card.\n\n## Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020\n\n## Financial Instruments - Credit Losses ('CECL')\n\nThe adoption of this guidance established a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This framework requires that management's estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument's remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Prior to the adoption of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm's allowance for credit losses represented management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Firm's retained loan portfolios and certain lending-related commitments.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe following table identifies JPMorgan Chase's other significant accounting policies and the Note and page where a detailed description of each policy can be found.\n\n| Fair value measurement                                                                      | Note 2   | page 167   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Fair value option                                                                           | Note 3   | page 188   |\n| Derivative instruments                                                                      | Note 5   | page 194   |\n| Noninterest revenue and noninterest  expense                                                | Note 6   | page 208   |\n| Interest income and Interest expense                                                        | Note 7   | page 211   |\n| Pension and other postretirement  employee benefit plans                                    | Note 8   | page 212   |\n| Employee share-based incentives                                                             | Note 9   | page 215   |\n| Investment securities                                                                       | Note 10  | page 217   |\n| Securities financing activities                                                             | Note 11  | page 222   |\n| Loans                                                                                       | Note 12  | page 225   |\n| Allowance for credit losses                                                                 | Note 13  | page 242   |\n| Variable interest entities                                                                  | Note 14  | page 247   |\n| Goodwill and Mortgage servicing rights                                                      | Note 15  | page 255   |\n| Premises and equipment                                                                      | Note 16  | page 259   |\n| Leases                                                                                      | Note 18  | page 260   |\n| Long-term debt                                                                              | Note 20  | page 263   |\n| Earnings per share                                                                          | Note 23  | page 268   |\n| Income taxes                                                                                | Note 25  | page 270   |\n| Off-balance sheet lending-related financial  instruments, guarantees and other  commitments | Note 28  | page 276   |\n| Litigation                                                                                  | Note 30  | page 283   |",

        "page_content": "## Note 2 - Fair value measurement\n\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value. These assets and liabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on a recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that are measured and reported at fair value on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets). Certain assets, liabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).\n\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market prices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based on valuation models and other valuation techniques that consider relevant transaction characteristics (such as maturity) and use, as inputs, observable or unobservable market parameters, including yield curves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), correlations, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value, as described below.\n\nThe level of precision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm's businesses and portfolios.\n\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of different methodologies or assumptions by other market participants compared with those used by the Firm could result in the Firm deriving a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Valuation process\n\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing fair value estimates for assets and liabilities carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The Firm's Valuation Control Group ('VCG'), which is part of the Firm's Finance function and independent of the risk-taking functions, is responsible for verifying these estimates and determining any fair value adjustments that may be required to ensure that the Firm's positions are recorded at fair value. In addition, the Firm's Valuation Governance Forum ('VGF'), which is composed of senior finance and risk executives, is responsible for overseeing the management of risks arising from valuation activities conducted across the Firm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head of the VCG (under the direction of the Firm's Controller), and includes sub-forums covering the\n\nCIB, CCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including Treasury and CIO.\n\n## Price verification process\n\nThe VCG verifies fair value estimates provided by the risktaking functions by leveraging independently derived prices, valuation inputs and other market data, where available. Where independent prices or inputs are not available, the VCG performs additional review to ensure the reasonableness of the estimates. The additional review may include evaluating the limited market activity including client unwinds, benchmarking valuation inputs to those used for similar instruments, decomposing the valuation of structured instruments into individual components, comparing expected to actual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends, and reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There are also additional levels of management review for more significant or complex positions.\n\nThe VCG determines any valuation adjustments that may be required to the estimates provided by the risk-taking functions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied for instruments classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for further information on the fair value hierarchy). For other positions, judgment is required to assess the need for valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The determination of such adjustments follows a consistent framework across the Firm:\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidity valuation adjustments are considered where an observable external price or valuation parameter exists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to lower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments are made based on current market conditions. Factors that may be considered in determining the liquidity adjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bidoffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2) alternative pricing points for similar instruments in active markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values that the price or parameter could take.\n- \u00b7 The Firm manages certain portfolios of financial instruments on the basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted by U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value of such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the entire net open risk position in an orderly transaction. Where this is the case, valuation adjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of exiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk position. Where applied, such adjustments are based on factors that a relevant market participant would consider in the transfer of the net open risk position, including the size of the adverse market move that is likely to occur during the period required to reduce the net open risk position to a normal market-size.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 Uncertainty adjustments related to unobservable parameters may be made when positions are valued using prices or input parameters to valuation models that are unobservable due to a lack of market activity or because they cannot be implied from observable market data. Such prices or parameters must be estimated and are, therefore, subject to management judgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the uncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation estimate.\n- \u00b7 Where appropriate, the Firm also applies adjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to appropriately reflect counterparty credit quality (CVA), the Firm's own creditworthiness (DVA) and the impact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework across the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding adjustments on page 184 of this Note for more information on such adjustments.\n\n## Valuation model review and approval\n\nIf prices or quotes are not available for an instrument or a similar instrument, fair value is generally determined using valuation models that consider relevant transaction terms such as maturity and use as inputs market-based or independently sourced parameters. Where this is the case the price verification process described above is applied to the inputs in those models.\n\nUnder the Firm's Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy, MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as material changes to existing models, prior to implementation in the operating environment. In certain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the Firm's policy to allow a model to be used prior to review or approval. MRGR may also require the user to take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk if it is to be used in the interim. These actions will depend on the model and may include, for example, limitation of trading activity.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nA three-level fair value hierarchy has been established under U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value measurements. The fair value hierarchy is based on the observability of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n- \u00b7 Level 3 - one or more inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nA financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.",

        "page_content": "## Level 3 valuations\n\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair value is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 167-171 of this Note for further information on the Firm's valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.\n\nEstimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\n\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to the lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\n\nThe following table presents the Firm's primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being used to value.\n\nIn the Firm's view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm's estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-toperiod and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs\n\nThe following discussion provides a description of the impact on a fair value measurement of a change in each unobservable input in isolation, and the interrelationship between unobservable inputs, where relevant and significant. The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a change in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do exist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment rates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.\n\nThe following discussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm's positions.\n\nYield - The yield of an asset is the interest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nCredit spread - The credit spread is the amount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for taking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount rate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgagebacked security primarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the coupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the range of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the characteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For corporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit spreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation.\n\nPrepayment speed - The prepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a collateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment speeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par and an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par.\n\nPrepayment speeds may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the remaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being paid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate than those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal.\n\nConditional default rate - The conditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a collateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between conditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has high prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates would generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in the conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional default rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the securitization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm's marketmaking portfolios, conditional default rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented.\n\nLoss severity - The loss severity (the inverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate liquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An increase in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the loss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe loss severity applied in valuing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including the LTV ratio, the nature of the lender's lien on the property and other instrumentspecific factors.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nCorrelation - Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a pricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation inputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity) due to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one parameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in isolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe level of correlation used in the valuation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of those risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between two interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as the relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore, correlation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels within or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions.\n\nVolatility - Volatility is a measure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the particular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options, including equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the underlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement.\n\nThe level of volatility used in the valuation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk underlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from that of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\n\nBermudan switch value - The switch value is the difference between the overall value of a Bermudan swaption, which can be exercised at multiple points in time, and its most expensive European swaption and reflects the additional value that the multiple exercise dates provide the holder. Switch values are dependent on market conditions and can vary greatly depending on a number of factors, such as the tenor of the underlying swap as well as the strike price of the option. An increase in switch value, in isolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement .\n\nInterest rate curve - represents the relationship of interest rates over differing tenors. The interest rate curve is used to set interest rate and foreign exchange derivative cash flows and is also a pricing input used in the discounting of any derivative cash flow.\n\nForward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward contract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at inception.\n\nThe forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of factors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received and costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in the forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement.\n\n## Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\n\nThe following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm riskmanages the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm's risk management activities related to such level 3 instruments.",

These market parameters generally do not consider factors such as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm's own credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it is generally necessary to make adjustments to the base estimate of fair value to reflect these factors.\n\nCVA represents the adjustment, relative to the relevant benchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect counterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates CVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected positive credit exposure across all of the Firm's existing positions with each counterparty, and then estimates losses based on the probability of default and estimated recovery rate as a result of a counterparty credit event considering contractual factors designed to mitigate the Firm's credit exposure, such as collateral and legal rights of offset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the probability of a default event occurring for each counterparty, as derived from observed or estimated CDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied by CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences in recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to those reflected in CDS spreads, which generally reflect senior unsecured creditor risk.\n\nFVA represents the adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is recognized where there is evidence that a market participant in the principal market would incorporate it in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm's FVA framework, applied to uncollateralized (including partially collateralized) over-the-counter ('OTC') derivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the expected funding requirements arising from the Firm's positions with\n\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and (ii) the estimated market funding cost in the principal market which, for derivative liabilities, considers the Firm's credit risk (DVA). For collateralized derivatives, the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at the relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the underlying collateral agreement with the counterparty, and therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\n\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below includes the impact of the Firm's own credit quality on the inception value of liabilities as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's own credit quality over time.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020     |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Credit and funding adjustments:          |        |        |          |\n| Derivatives CVA                          | $  22  | $  362 | $  (337) |\n| Derivatives FVA                          | 42     | 47     | (64)     |\n\n## Valuation adjustments on fair value option elected liabilities\n\nThe valuation of the Firm's liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected requires consideration of the Firm's own credit risk. DVA on fair value option elected liabilities reflects changes (subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the Firm's probability of default and LGD, which are estimated based on changes in the Firm's credit spread observed in the bond market. Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal transactions revenue. Unrealized (gains)/losses are reported in OCI.

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the Firm's valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\n\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions)   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Other assets                                             |          |          |\n| Carrying value (a)                                       | $  4,096 | $  3,642 |\n| Upward carrying value changes (b)                        | 488      | 432      |\n| Downward carrying value changes/impairment (c)           | (826)    | (53)     |\n\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm's interest in Visa Class B common shares ('Visa B shares') recorded at a nominal carrying value. In November 2022, the Firm sold approximately 3 million Visa B shares, resulting in a net pretax gain of $914 million recorded in other income. Visa B shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares ('Visa A shares') at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving Visa. In connection with the sale, and consistent with the Firm's sale of 20 million Visa B shares in 2013, the Firm entered into a derivative instrument with the purchaser of the shares, under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.\n\nUnder the terms of the derivative instrument, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchaser of the Visa B shares. The payments under the derivative continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer restrictions. The derivative is accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the Firm's estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The derivative is recorded in trading liabilities and changes in fair value are recognized in other income. As of December 31, 2022, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with the 23 million Visa B shares that it has sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Firm's remaining interest in Visa B shares was approximately 37 million shares. On January 5, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.6059 to 1.5991 effective December 29, 2022. The conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown, and accordingly, as of December 31, 2022, there is significant uncertainty regarding the date of the termination of transfer restrictions and the value of the final conversion rate. As a result of this, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.\n\n## Additional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value\n\nU.S. GAAP requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, which are included in the following table. However, this table does not include other items, such as nonfinancial assets, intangible assets, certain financial instruments, and customer relationships. In the opinion of management, these items, in the aggregate, add significant value to JPMorgan Chase, but their fair value is not disclosed in this table.\n\n## Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value\n\nCertain financial instruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that approximate fair value, due to their shortterm nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments include cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings, federal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and",

For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value for the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are credit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\n\n- information, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries.\n- \u00b7 Long-term debt: Changes in value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm's credit spread as observed in the bond market.\n- \u00b7 Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-specific credit risk related to these agreements.",

Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm's risk appetite.\n\nIn the Firm's consumer portfolio, concentrations are managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the Firm's consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty basis.\n\nThe Firm's wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales, securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans.\n\nThe Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk.\n\nTerms of loan products and collateral coverage are included in the Firm's assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 5 - Derivative instruments\n\nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a combination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability without having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of the Firm's derivatives are entered into for marketmaking or risk management purposes.\n\n## Market-making derivatives\n\nThe majority of the Firm's derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to mitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages the risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or selling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives.\n\n## Risk management derivatives\n\nThe Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments, including derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities.\n\nThe Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the risk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in market value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of variablerate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and subsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses on the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this variability.\n\nForeign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as the Firm's net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollarequivalent values of the foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability.\n\nCommodities derivatives are used to manage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are expected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory.\n\nCredit derivatives are used to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit derivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as bankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the Credit derivatives section on pages 205-207 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\n\nRefer to the risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 205 and the hedge accounting gains and losses tables on pages 202-204 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives.\n\nDerivative counterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled bilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures and options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts traded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm's counterparty from the inception of the transactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\n\n## Derivative clearing services\n\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing member at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients' derivative contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm's clearing services.\n\n## Accounting for derivatives\n\nAll free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to be recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value.\n\nAs permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets derivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative depends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on pages 198-205 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets, liabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in structured notes.",

However, JPMorgan Chase does not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives associated with the Firm's risk management activities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For the same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives used for risk management purposes.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be designated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must identify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be hedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess effectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as dollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those terms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is discontinued.\n\nThere are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS securities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings as a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue.\n\nJPMorgan Chase uses cash flow hedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and liabilities and foreign currencydenominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative are\n\nrecorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item - primarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash flows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted transaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values recorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings.\n\nJPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the value of the Firm's net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to changes in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features\n\nIn addition to the specific market risks introduced by each derivative contract type, derivatives expose JPMorgan Chase to credit risk - the risk that derivative counterparties may fail to meet their payment obligations under the derivative contracts and the collateral, if any, held by the Firm proves to be of insufficient value to cover the payment obligation. It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk inherent in derivative receivables.\n\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk, as the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as the fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties' favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm's and its subsidiaries' respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the contract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative contracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## OTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers\n\n| (in millions)                                   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Aggregate fair value of net derivative payables | $  16,023           | $  20,114           |\n| Collateral posted                               | 15,505              | 19,402              |\n\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2022 and 2021, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.\n\n## Liquidity impact of downgrade triggers on OTC and OTC-cleared derivatives\n\n|                                                                                  | December 31, 2022       | December 31, 2022    | December 31, 2021       | December 31, 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| (in millions)                                                                    | Single-notch  downgrade | Two-notch  downgrade | Single-notch  downgrade | Two-notch  downgrade |\n| Amount of additional collateral to be posted upon downgrade (a)                  | $  128  $               | 1,293                | $  219  $               | 1,577                |\n| Amount required to settle contracts with termination triggers upon downgrade (b) | 88                      | 925                  | 98                      | 787                  |\n\n## Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset\n\nIn certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated derivative was outstanding was not material at both December 31, 2022 and 2021.",

transactions that failed to occur for the years ended 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nOver the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $(1.5) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in AOCI at December 31, 2022, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm's longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing activities.\n\n## Net investment hedge gains and losses\n\nThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n|                                       | 2022                                | 2022                      | 2021                                | 2021                     | 2020                                | 2020                     |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions) | Amounts  recorded in  income (a)(b) | Amounts  recorded in  OCI | Amounts  recorded in  income (a)(b) | Amounts  recorded in OCI | Amounts  recorded in  income (a)(b) | Amounts  recorded in OCI |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives          | $(123)                              | $3,591                    | $(228)                              | $2,452                   | $(122)                              | $(1,408)                 |",

All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\n\n## Credit derivatives\n\nCredit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk associated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection purchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments under the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its obligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has the risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event.\n\nThe Firm is both a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two primary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit derivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the needs of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with lending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) in its wholesale and consumer businesses and derivatives counterparty exposures in its wholesale businesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm's market-making businesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Credit default swaps\n\nCredit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity ('single-name'), broad-based index or portfolio. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference obligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-name CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to manage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and other market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS indices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in the credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference entity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of reference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide protection against the first $1 million of realized credit losses in a $10 million portfolio of exposure. Such structures are commonly known as tranche CDS.\n\nFor both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the occurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to the reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the face value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit derivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt instrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit event occurs.\n\n## Credit-related notes\n\nA credit-related note is a funded derivative with a credit risk component where the issuer of the credit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the contract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in return, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The issuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the entities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the issuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference between the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of settlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity.\n\nThe following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and purchased as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically pay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be paid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement. The Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar underlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit derivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and other reference points) as well as protection purchased by CIB through credit-related notes primarily in its market-making businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection against certain loans in the retained consumer portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Since these credit-related notes are not part of the market-making businesses they are not included in the table below.",

The related contracts are often terminable on demand and the Firm has no remaining obligation to deliver future services. For arrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to deliver services in the future. Revenue associated with these remaining performance obligations typically depends on the occurrence of future events or underlying asset values, and is not recognized until the outcome of those events or values are known.\n\n## Investment banking fees\n\nThis revenue category includes debt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an underwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via public offering and private placement of various types of debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are primarily based on the issuance price and quantity of the underlying instruments, and are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client's transaction. The Firm also manages and syndicates loan arrangements. Credit arrangement and syndication fees, included within debt underwriting fees, are recorded as revenue after satisfying certain retention, timing and yield criteria.\n\nThe Firm also provides advisory services, by assisting its clients with mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring and other complex transactions. Advisory fees are recognized as revenue typically upon execution of the client's transaction.\n\nThe following table presents the components of investment banking fees.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2022     | 2021      | 2020     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| Underwriting                             |          |           |          |\n| Equity                                   | $  975   | $  3,969  | $  2,759 |\n| Debt                                     | 2,732    | 4,853     | 4,362    |\n| Total underwriting                       | 3,707    | 8,822     | 7,121    |\n| Advisory                                 | 2,979    | 4,394     | 2,365    |\n| Total investment banking fees            | $  6,686 | $  13,216 | $  9,486 |\n\nInvestment banking fees are earned primarily by CIB. Refer to Note 32 for segment results.\n\n## Principal transactions\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue is driven by many factors, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the bid-offer spread, which is the difference between the price at which a market participant is willing and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and the price at which another market participant is willing and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice versa; and\n- \u00b7 realized and unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments and commodities transactions, including those accounted for under the fair value option, primarily used in client-driven market-making activities, and on private equity investments.\n- - Realized gains and losses result from the sale of instruments, closing out or termination of transactions, or interim cash payments.\n- - Unrealized gains and losses result from changes in valuation.\n\nIn connection with its client-driven market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities, including physical commodities inventories and financial instruments that reference commodities.\n\nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes realized and unrealized gains and losses related to:\n\n- \u00b7 derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships, primarily fair value hedges of commodity and foreign exchange risk;\n- \u00b7 derivatives used for specific risk management purposes, primarily to mitigate credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risks.\n\nRefer to Note 5 for further information on the income statement classification of gains and losses from derivatives activities.\n\nIn the financial commodity markets, the Firm transacts in OTC derivatives (e.g., swaps, forwards, options) and ETD that reference a wide range of underlying commodities. In the physical commodity markets, the Firm primarily purchases and sells precious and base metals and may hold other commodities inventories under financing and other arrangements with clients.\n\nThe following table presents all realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal transactions revenue. This table excludes interest income and interest expense on trading assets and liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall performance of the Firm's client-driven marketmaking activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further information on interest income and interest expense.\n\nTrading revenue is presented primarily by instrument type. The Firm's client-driven market-making businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument types in connection with their market-making and related risk-management activities; accordingly, the trading revenue presented in the table below is not representative of the total revenue of any individual LOB.",

Depositrelated fees include fees earned from providing overdraft and other deposit account services, and from performing cash management activities. Lending- and deposit-related fees in this revenue category are recognized over the period in which the related service is provided.\n\nThe following table presents the components of lendingand deposit-related fees.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)   | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Lending-related fees                    | $ 1,468 | $ 1,472 | $ 1,271 |\n| Deposit-related fees                    | 5,630   | 5,560   | 5,240   |\n| Total lending- and deposit-related fees | $ 7,098 | $ 7,032 | $ 6,511 |\n\nLending- and deposit-related fees are earned by CCB, CIB, CB, and AWM.

Management fees are typically based on the value of assets under management and are collected and recognized at the end of each period over which the management services are provided and the value of the managed assets is known. The Firm also receives performance-based management fees, which are earned based on exceeding certain benchmarks or other performance targets and are accrued and recognized when the probability of reversal is remote, typically at the end of the related billing period. The Firm has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide distribution and other services in connection with its asset management activities.

Card income also includes account origination costs and annual fees, which are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period.\n\nCertain credit card products offer the cardholder the ability to earn points based on account activity, which the cardholder can choose to redeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the Firm related to these proprietary rewards programs varies based on multiple factors including the terms and conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder activity, cardholder reward redemption rates and cardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a liability for its obligations under its rewards programs and reports the current-period cost as a reduction of card income.\n\n## Credit card revenue sharing agreements\n\nThe Firm has contractual agreements with numerous cobrand partners that grant the Firm exclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card products and market them to the customers of such partners. These partners endorse the cobrand credit card programs and provide their customer or member lists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct marketing activities and provide rewards redeemable under their own loyalty programs that the Firm will grant to cobrand credit cardholders based on account activity. The terms of these agreements generally range from five to ten years.\n\nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand credit card partners based on the cost of partners' marketing activities and loyalty program rewards provided to credit cardholders, new account originations and sales volumes. Payments to partners based on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners are expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as marketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty program rewards are reported as a reduction of card income when incurred. Payments to partners based on new credit card account originations are accounted for as direct loan origination costs and are deferred and recognized as a reduction of card income on a straight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments to partners based on sales volumes are reported as a reduction of card income when the related interchange\n\n## income is earned.\n\nThe following table presents the components of card income:\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)      | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interchange and merchant  processing income | $  28,085 | $  23,592 | $  18,563 |\n| Reward costs and partner  payments          | (22,162)  | (17,868)  | (13,637)  |\n| Other card income (a)                       | (1,503)   | (622)     | (491)     |\n| Total card income                           | $  4,420  | $  5,102  | $  4,435  |\n\nCard income is earned primarily by CCB, CIB and CB.

Substantially all the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants. The principal defined benefit pension plan in the U.S., which covered substantially all U.S. employees, was closed to new participants and frozen for existing participants on January 1, 2020, (and January 1, 2019 for new hires on or after December 2, 2017). Interest credits continue to accrue to participants' accounts based on their accumulated balances.\n\nThe Firm maintains funded and unfunded postretirement benefit plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees and retirees as well as their\n\ndependents covered under these programs. None of these plans have a material impact on the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Firm also provides a qualified defined contribution plan in the U.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in certain non-U.S. locations. The most significant of these plans is the JPMorgan Chase 401(k) Savings Plan ('the 401(k) Savings Plan'), which covers substantially all U.S. employees. Employees can contribute to the 401(k) Savings Plan on a pretax and/or Roth 401(k) after-tax basis. The Firm makes an annual matching contribution as well as an annual profit-sharing contribution to the 401(k) Savings Plan on behalf of eligible participants.\n\nThe following table presents the pretax benefit obligations, plan assets, the net funded status, and the amounts recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated balance sheets for the Firm's significant defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31,      | Defined benefit  pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit  pension and OPEB plans   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                 | 2022                                      | 2021                                      |\n| Projected benefit obligations                 | $  (13,545)                               | $  (18,046)                               |\n| Fair value of plan assets                     | 19,890                                    | 25,692                                    |\n| Net funded status                             | 6,345                                     | 7,646                                     |\n| Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) | (1,916)                                   | (453)                                     |\n\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to value the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, was 5.14% and 2.54%, respectively.\n\n## Gains and losses\n\nGains or losses resulting from changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are recorded in OCI. Amortization of net gains or losses are recognized as part of the net periodic benefit cost over subsequent periods, if, as of the beginning of the year, the net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of the plan assets. Amortization is generally over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants, given the frozen status of most plans. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a remeasurement of the Firm's U.S. principal defined benefit plan in the third quarter, was required as a result of a\n\npension settlement. The remeasurement resulted in a reduction in the fair value of the Firm's U.S. principal defined benefit plan assets, reflecting market conditions at the time of remeasurement, and a reduction in the plan's projected benefit obligation totaling $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, resulting in a net decrease of $1.4 billion in pre-tax AOCI. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the net gain was predominantly attributable to market-driven increases in the fair value of plan assets and the discount rate.\n\nThe following table presents the net periodic benefit costs reported in the Consolidated statements of income for the Firm's defined benefit pension, defined contribution and OPEB plans, and in other comprehensive income for the defined benefit pension and OPEB plans.\n\n|                                                             | Pension and OPEB plans   | Pension and OPEB plans   | Pension and OPEB plans   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)                       | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2020                     |\n| Total net periodic defined benefit plan cost/(credit) (a)   | $  (192)                 | $  (201)  $              | (285)                    |\n| Total defined contribution plans                            | 1,408                    | 1,333                    | 1,332                    |\n| Total pension and OPEB cost included in noninterest expense | $  1,216                 | $  1,132  $              | 1,047                    |\n| Total recognized in other comprehensive (income)/loss       | $  1,459                 | $  (1,129)  $            | (214)                    |",

Returns on asset classes are developed using a forward-looking approach and are not strictly based on historical returns, with consideration given to current market conditions and the portfolio mix of each plan.\n\nThe discount rates used in determining the benefit obligations are generally provided by the Firm's actuaries, with the Firm's principal defined benefit pension plan using a rate that was selected by reference to the yields on portfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons that closely match each of the plan's projected cash flows.\n\n## Investment strategy and asset allocation\n\nThe assets of the Firm's defined benefit pension plans are held in various trusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash equivalents, and alternative investments. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and asset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed necessary. The approved asset allocation ranges by asset class for the Firm's principal defined benefit plan are 42-100% debt securities, 0-40% equity securities, 0-3% real estate, and 0-12% alternatives as of December 31, 2022.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, assets held by the Firm's defined benefit pension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through indirect exposures through investments in exchange traded funds, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-parties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of JPMorgan Chase in the amount of $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\n## Fair value measurement of the plans' assets and liabilities\n\nRefer to Note 2 for information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of level 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Firm.\n\n## Pension plan assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\n|                                                                                                         | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   | Defined benefit pension and OPEB plans   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                         | 2022                                     | 2022                                     | 2022                                     | 2022                                     | 2021                                     | 2021                                     | 2021                                     | 2021                                     |\n| December 31 ,  (in millions)                                                                            | Level 1 (a)                              | Level 2 (b)                              | Level 3 (c)                              | Total fair value                         | Level 1 (a)                              | Level 2 (b)                              | Level 3 (c)                              | Total fair value                         |\n| Assets measured at fair value classified in fair  value hierarchy                                       | $  5,308  $                              | 9,617  $                                 | 2,613  $                                 | 17,538                                   | $                                        | 6,541  $  12,315  $                      | 3,172  $                                 | 22,028                                   |\n| Assets measured at fair value using NAV as  practical expedient not classified in fair value  hierarchy |                                          |                                          |                                          | 2,593                                    |                                          |                                          |                                          | 3,960                                    |\n| Net defined benefit pension plan payables not  classified in fair value hierarchy                       |                                          |                                          |                                          | (241)                                    |                                          |                                          |                                          | (296)                                    |\n| Total fair value of plan assets                                                                         |                                          |                                          |                                          | $  19,890                                |                                          |                                          |                                          | $  25,692                                |",

        "page_content": "## Note 9 - Employee share-based incentives\n\n## Employee share-based awards\n\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, JPMorgan Chase granted longterm share-based awards to certain employees under its LTIP, as amended and restated effective May 15, 2018, and subsequently amended effective May 18, 2021. Under the terms of the LTIP, as of December 31, 2022, 69 million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2025. The LTIP is the only active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following discussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to collectively as the 'LTI Plans,' and such plans constitute the Firm's share-based incentive plans.\n\nRSUs are awarded at no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after two years and 50% after three years and are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In addition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon voluntary termination based on age and/or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other restrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result in cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are outstanding.\n\nPerformance share units ('PSUs') are granted annually, and approved by the Firm's Board of Directors, to members of the Firm's Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the Firm's achievement of specified performance criteria over a threeyear period. The number of awards that vest can range from zero to 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are reinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted into shares of common stock after vesting.\n\nOnce the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the shares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be retained for an additional holding period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately five to eight years from the grant date depending on regulations in certain countries.\n\nUnder the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights ('SARs') and stock options have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase's common stock on the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten years after the grant date. In 2021, the Firm awarded its Chairman and CEO and its President and Chief Operating Officer 1.5 million and 750,000 SARs, respectively. There were no grants of SARs or stock options in 2022 and grants in 2020 were not material.\n\nThe Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for each tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date. Generally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career eligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no future substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to employees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each tranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee's full-career eligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche.\n\nThe Firm's policy for issuing shares upon settlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury shares. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury shares.\n\nRefer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of calculating earnings per share.",

Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously.

        "page_content": "## Note 10 - Investment securities\n\nInvestment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm's AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities.\n\nAFS securities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or allowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized gains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated statements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nFor both AFS and HTM securities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the earliest call date.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, the Firm transferred $78.3 billion and $104.5 billion of investment securities, respectively, from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains/(losses) of $(4.8) billion and $425 million, respectively, on the securities at the dates of transfer.\n\nUnrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value.\n\nTransfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded at fair value.",

Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the portfolio. The Firm's internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody's,\n\nhowever the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default ('PD') and loss given default ('LGD')) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at acquisition, reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and adjusted as necessary over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer's ability to fulfill its obligations.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nAFS securities are considered impaired if the fair value is less than the amortized cost.\n\nThe Firm recognizes impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these circumstances the impairment loss is recognized in investment securities gains/(losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income and is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the security.\n\nFor impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income, limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment on debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI.\n\nFactors considered in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security.\n\nWhen assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the losses projected for the underlying collateral ('pool losses') against the level of credit enhancement in the securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a credit loss exists.\n\nFor beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below 'AA' at their acquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in expected cash flows.\n\n## HTM securities - credit risk\n\n## Allowance for credit losses\n\nThe allowance for credit losses represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of HTM securities.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD and LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss factors are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated as the difference between the amortized cost and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the security's effective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed based on expectations of underlying collateral performance derived using the eight-quarter macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-line interpolation, as well as considering the structural features of the security.\n\nThe application of different inputs and assumptions into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses is subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM securities.\n\n## Credit quality indicator\n\nThe primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is the risk rating assigned to each security. At both December 31, 2022 and 2021, all HTM securities were rated investment grade and were current and accruing, with approximately 98% rated at least AA+.\n\n## Allowance for credit losses on investment securities\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment securities was $96 million, $42 million and $78 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Selected impacts of investment securities on the Consolidated statements of income\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2022      | 2021     | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Realized gains                           | $  198    | $  595   | $ 3,080 |\n| Realized losses                          | (2,578)   | (940)    | (2,278) |\n| Investment securities gains/ (losses)    | $ (2,380) | $  (345) | $  802  |\n| Provision for credit losses              | $  54     | $  (36)  | $  68   |",

Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe Firm has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense, with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal transactions revenue.\n\nSecurities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at amortized cost. As a result of the Firm's credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation practices\n\nSecurities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn resale and securities borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It is also the Firm's policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements.",

        "page_content": "The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm's securities financing agreements, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\n\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as 'Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,' and reduces the 'Net amounts' presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the 'Net amounts' below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\n|                                              | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022                                    | December 31, 2022                                       | December 31, 2022                                            | December 31, 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| (in millions)                                | Gross amounts       | Amounts netted  on the  Consolidated  balance sheets | Amounts  presented on the  Consolidated  balance sheets | Amounts not nettable on the  Consolidated balance sheets (b) | Net amounts (c)     |\n| Assets                                       |                     |                                                      |                                                         |                                                              |                     |\n| Securities purchased under resale agreements | $  597,912  $       | (282,411)  $                                         | 315,501  $                                              | (304,120)                                                    | $  11,381           |\n| Securities borrowed                          | 228,279             | (42,910)                                             | 185,369                                                 | (131,578)                                                    | 53,791              |\n| Liabilities                                  |                     |                                                      |                                                         |                                                              |                     |\n| Securities sold under repurchase agreements  | $  480,793  $       | (282,411)  $                                         | 198,382  $                                              | (167,427)                                                    | $  30,955           |\n| Securities loaned and other (a)              | 52,443              | (42,910)                                             | 9,533                                                   | (9,527)                                                      | 6                   |\n|                                              | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021                                    | December 31, 2021                                       | December 31, 2021                                            | December 31, 2021   |\n| (in millions)                                | Gross amounts       | Amounts netted  on the  Consolidated  balance sheets | Amounts  presented on the  Consolidated  balance sheets | Amounts not nettable on the  Consolidated balance sheets (b) | Net amounts (c)     |\n| Assets                                       |                     |                                                      |                                                         |                                                              |                     |\n| Securities purchased under resale agreements | $  604,724  $       | (343,093)  $                                         | 261,631  $                                              | (245,588)                                                    | $  16,043           |\n| Securities borrowed                          | 250,333             | (44,262)                                             | 206,071                                                 | (154,599)                                                    | 51,472              |\n| Liabilities                                  |                     |                                                      |                                                         |                                                              |                     |\n| Securities sold under repurchase agreements  | $  532,899  $       | (343,093)  $                                         | 189,806  $                                              | (166,456)                                                    | $  23,350           |\n| Securities loaned and other (a)              | 52,610              | (44,262)                                             | 8,348                                                   | (8,133)                                                      | 215                 |",

        "page_content": "## Note 12 - Loans\n\n## Loan accounting framework\n\nThe accounting for a loan depends on management's strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., 'retained')\n- \u00b7 Loans held-for-sale\n- \u00b7 Loans at fair value\n\nThe following provides a detailed accounting discussion of the Firm's loans by category:\n\n## Loans held-for-investment\n\nOriginated or purchased loans held-for-investment, including PCD, are recorded at amortized cost, reflecting the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: unamortized deferred loan fees, costs, premiums or discounts; charge-offs; collection of cash; and foreign exchange. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees.\n\n## Interest income\n\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield.\n\nThe Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\n\n## Nonaccrual loans\n\nNonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30 days or more.\n\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.\n\nOn the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans, application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans on a cash basis.\n\nA loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan.\n\nAs permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status; accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or paid in full.\n\n## Allowance for loan losses\n\nThe allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm's Consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 13 for further information on the Firm's accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses.\n\n## Charge-offs\n\nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable value of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than 180 days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120 days past due.\n\nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-off standards in the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-dependent.\n- \u00b7 Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g.,",

The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the prioritization of the Firm's claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower's equity or the loan collateral.\n\nWhen a loan is charged down to the lower of its amortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model.\n\nFor residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker's price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation ('exterior opinions'), which is then updated at least every 12 months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home ('interior appraisals'). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm's experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering statespecific factors.\n\nFor commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every six to twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm's policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals.\n\n## Loans held-for-sale\n\nLoans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an individual loan basis.\n\nInterest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest.\n\nLoan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale.\n\nBecause these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm's allowance for loan losses and chargeoff policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.\n\n## Loans at fair value\n\nLoans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue.\n\nInterest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as incurred.\n\nBecause these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm's allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above.\n\nRefer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.",

        "page_content": "## Loan classification changes\n\nLoans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are transferred to the held-forsale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue.\n\nIn the event that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for impairment based on the Firm's allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the methodologies used in establishing the Firm's allowance for loan losses.\n\n## Loan modifications\n\nThe Firm seeks to modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the Firm's economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrowerspecific characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness, or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\n\nLoans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six months and/or six payments, and (ii) the Firm has an expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower's debt capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In certain limited and welldefined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification.\n\nLoans modified in TDRs are generally measured for impairment using the Firm's established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected redefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm's asset-specific allowance.\n\n## Foreclosed property\n\nThe Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships).\n\nThe Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense.",

The portfolio also includes home equity loans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans with an interest-only payment period, and certain payment-option loans that may result in negative amortization.\n\nThe following table provides information about retained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by class.\n\n| December 31, (in millions)   | 2022       | 2021       |\n|------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Residential real estate      | $  237,561 | $  224,795 |\n| Auto and other (a)           | 63,192     | 70,761     |\n| Total retained loans         | $  300,753 | $  295,556 |\n\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is likely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies (greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower's continued willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower's current or 'refreshed' FICO score is a secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower's credit payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high FICO score.\n- \u00b7 For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.",

The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm's allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period. That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.",

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new TDRs was $362 million, $866 million and $819 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs.\n\n## Nature and extent of modifications\n\nThe Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm's loss mitigation programs described above during the periods presented.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the regional economy.\n\nWhile the borrower's credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower's credit score tends to be a lagging indicator. The\n\ndistribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance. Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry benchmark for credit scores.\n\nThe Firm generally originates new credit card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However, certain cardholders' FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes in the credit score calculation.\n\nThe following tables provide information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained credit card loans.\n\n|                                                           | December 31, 2022           | December 31, 2022           | December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|\n| (in millions, except ratios)                              | Within the revolving period | Converted to term loans (a) | Total               |\n| Loan delinquency                                          |                             |                             |                     |\n| Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing | $  181,793                  | $  696                      | $  182,489          |\n| 30-89 days past due and still accruing                    | 1,356                       | 64                          | 1,420               |\n| 90 or more days past due and still accruing               | 1,230                       | 36                          | 1,266               |\n| Total retained loans                                      | $  184,379                  | $  796                      | $  185,175          |\n| Loan delinquency ratios                                   |                             |                             |                     |\n| % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans            | 1.40 %                      | 12.56 %                     | 1.45 %              |\n| % of 90+ days past due to total retained loans            | 0.67                        | 4.52                        | 0.68                |\n|                                                           | December 31, 2021           | December 31, 2021           | December 31, 2021   |\n| (in millions, except ratios)                              | Within the revolving period | Converted to term loans (a) | Total               |\n| Loan delinquency                                          |                             |                             |                     |\n| Current and less than 30 days past due and still accruing | $  151,798                  | $  901                      | $  152,699          |\n| 30-89 days past due and still accruing                    | 770                         | 59                          | 829                 |\n| 90 or more days past due and still accruing               | 741                         | 27                          | 768                 |\n| Total retained loans                                      | $  153,309                  | $  987                      | $  154,296          |\n| Loan delinquency ratios                                   |                             |                             |                     |\n| % of 30+ days past due to total retained loans            | 0.99 %                      | 8.71 %                      | 1.04 %              |\n| % of 90+ days past due to total retained loans            | 0.48                        | 2.74                        | 0.50                |",

The Firm grants concessions for most of the credit card loans under long-term programs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed payment plan, generally for 60 months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card. Substantially all modifications under the Firm's long-term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs.\n\nIf the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.\n\nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults The following table provides information about the financial effects of the concessions granted on credit card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit card loans.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions, except weighted-average data)    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Balance of new TDRs (a)                                                | $  418  | $  393  | $  818  |\n| Weighted-average interest rate of  loans - before TDR                  | 19.86 % | 17.75 % | 18.04 % |\n| Weighted-average interest rate of  loans - after TDR                   | 4.13    | 5.14    | 4.64    |\n| Balance of loans that redefaulted  within one year of modification (b) | $  34   | $  57   | $  110  |\n\nFor credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses two consecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.",

Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility.\n\nManagement considers several factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor's debt capacity and financial flexibility, the level of the obligor's earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm's internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody's, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings.\n\nNoninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management's assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm's definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful categories.\n\nRisk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor's ability to fulfill its obligations.\n\nAs noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with an actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.",

to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to suspend TDR accounting guidance under the option provided by the CARES Act. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $801 million, $881 million and $734 million, respectively. New TDRs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 reflected the extension of maturity dates, covenant waivers, receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments, predominantly in the Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. The impact of these modifications resulting in new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe carrying value of TDRs was $936 million and $607 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 13 - Allowance for credit losses\n\nThe Firm's allowance for credit losses represents management's estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm's retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,\n- \u00b7 the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and\n- \u00b7 the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses.\n\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods.\n\nThe Firm's policies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\n\n## Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lendingrelated commitments\n\nThe allowance for loan losses and allowance for lendingrelated commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans are considered in the Firm's allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income.\n\nThe expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date)\n\nversus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first.\n\nThe estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\n\n## Collective and Individual Assessments\n\nWhen calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance.\n\n- \u00b7 Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios.\n- \u00b7 Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include risk rating, delinquency status, tenor, level and type of collateral, LOB, geography, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, and payment terms.\n\nThe majority of the Firm's credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment ('portfolio-based component'). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments.\n\nIf an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure ('asset-specific component'). The asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateraldependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.\n\n## Portfolio-based component\n\nThe portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over an instrument's expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm's estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using",

        "page_content": "a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period. The five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm's central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management.\n\nThe quantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties.\n\nThe application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n\n## Asset-specific component\n\nTo determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets.\n\nThe Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that should be\n\nrecognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of collateral).\n\nThe asset-specific component of the allowance for loans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan's expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm's historical experience by type of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management's expectation of the borrower's ability to repay under the modified terms.\n\nEstimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic conditions, industry, portfolio, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.",

The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.6% in the second quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe Firm's central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\n\n|                                 | Assumptions at December 31, 2022   | Assumptions at December 31, 2022   | Assumptions at December 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                 | 2Q23                               | 4Q23                               | 2Q24                               |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 3.8  %                             | 4.3  %                             | 5.0  %                             |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 1.5  %                             | 0.4  %                             | - %                                |\n|                                 | Assumptions at December 31, 2021   | Assumptions at December 31, 2021   | Assumptions at December 31, 2021   |\n|                                 | 2Q22                               | 4Q22                               | 2Q23                               |\n| U.S. unemployment rate (a)      | 4.2 %                              | 4.0 %                              | 3.9 %                              |\n| YoY growth in U.S. real GDP (b) | 3.1 %                              | 2.8 %                              | 2.1 %                              |\n\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related estimates will be reflected in the provision for credit losses in future periods.\n\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the Firm on pages 149-152 for further information on the allowance for credit losses and related management judgments.

The Firm considers a 'Firm-sponsored' VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the structure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase-administered asset-backed commercial paper conduit.\n\n| Line of Business   | Transaction Type                         | Activity                                                                                                                              | 2022 Form 10-K page references   |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| CIB                | Credit card securitization trusts        | Securitization of originated credit card receivables                                                                                  | pages 247-248                    |\n| CIB                | Mortgage securitization trusts           | Servicing and securitization of both originated and  purchased residential mortgages                                                  | pages 248-250                    |\n|                    | Mortgage and other securitization trusts | Securitization of both originated and purchased  residential and commercial mortgages, and other  consumer loans                      | pages 248-250                    |\n|                    | Multi-seller conduits                    | Assisting clients in accessing the financial markets in  a cost-efficient manner and structuring transactions  to meet investor needs | page 250                         |\n|                    | Municipal bond vehicles                  | Financing of municipal bond investments                                                                                               | pages 250-251                    |\n\nThe Firm's other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a lesser extent, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the funds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund's investment objective and is competitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM's interests are, in certain cases, considered to be significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\n- \u00b7 Commercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including certain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of these entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB's maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the entity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in the same manner as any other thirdparty transaction.\n- \u00b7 Corporate: Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are generally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of investments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties which may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not have the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these entities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio.\n\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 251-252 of this Note for more information on consolidated VIE assets and liabilities as well as the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\n\n## Significant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\n\n## Credit card securitizations\n\nCCB's Card Services business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the Chase Issuance Trust (the 'Trust'). The Firm's continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller's interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior and subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts.\n\nThe Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of its sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts based on the Firm's ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other duties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any related modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm's other continuing involvement with the\n\ntrusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive certain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant.\n\nThe underlying securitized credit card receivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial interests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm's other obligations or the claims of the Firm's creditors.\n\nThe agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to maintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $6.1 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal",

The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $1.5 billion of subordinated securities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Firm's undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts\n\nThe Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\n\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm's only continuing involvement is servicing the loans. The Firm's maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value of these interests.\n\n|                                 |                                             |                                                     |                                                                                     | JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in  nonconsolidated VIEs (c)(d)(e)   | JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in  nonconsolidated VIEs (c)(d)(e)   | JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in  nonconsolidated VIEs (c)(d)(e)   | JPMorgan Chase interest in securitized assets in  nonconsolidated VIEs (c)(d)(e)   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| December 31, 2022 (in millions) | Total assets  held by  securitization  VIEs | Assets  held in  consolidated  securitization  VIEs | Assets held in  nonconsolidated  securitization  VIEs with  continuing  involvement | Trading  assets                                                                    | Investment  securities                                                             | Other  financial  assets                                                           | Total  interests  held by  JPMorgan  Chase                                         |\n| Securitization-related (a)      |                                             |                                                     |                                                                                     |                                                                                    |                                                                                    |                                                                                    |                                                                                    |\n| Residential mortgage:           |                                             |                                                     |                                                                                     |                                                                                    |                                                                                    |                                                                                    |                                                                                    |\n| Prime/Alt-A and option ARMs     | $  55,362  $                                | 754  $                                              | 37,058                                                                              | $  744  $                                                                          | 1,918  $                                                                           |                                                                                    | -

        "page_content": "## Residential mortgage\n\nThe Firm securitizes residential mortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as residential mortgage loans purchased from third parties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains servicing for all residential mortgage loans it originated or purchased, and for certain mortgage loans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans serviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE because it is responsible for decisions related to loan modifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an interest upon securitization.\n\nIn addition, CIB engages in underwriting and trading activities involving securities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization trusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior and/or subordinated interests (including residual interests and amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization, and/or reacquires positions in the secondary market in the normal course of business. In certain instances, as a result of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB or held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered together with the servicing arrangements entered into by CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of certain securitization trusts.\n\nThe Firm does not consolidate residential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored or third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer (and therefore does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust) or does not hold a beneficial interest in the trust that could potentially be significant to the trust.\n\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer securitizations CIB originates and securitizes commercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting and trading activities involving the securities issued by securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior and/or subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the time of securitization but, generally, the Firm does not service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury and CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations as well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE generally is held by the servicer or investors in a specified class of securities ('controlling class'). The Firm generally does not retain an interest in the controlling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage securitization transactions.\n\n## Re-securitizations\n\nThe Firm engages in certain re-securitization transactions in which debt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange for new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in connection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency sponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential mortgages. The Firm's consolidation analysis is largely dependent on the Firm's role and interest in the re-securitization trusts.\n\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Transfers of securities to VIEs          |           |           |           |\n| U.S. GSEs and government  agencies       | $  16,128 | $  53,923 | $  46,123 |\n\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is involved are client-driven transactions in which a specific client or group of clients is seeking a specific return or risk profile. For these transactions, the Firm has concluded that the decision-making power of the entity is shared between the Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort and decisions in establishing the re-securitization trust and its assets, as well as the significant economic interest the client holds in the re-securitization trust; therefore the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.\n\nThe Firm did not transfer any private label securities to resecuritization VIEs during 2022, 2021 and 2020, and retained interests in any such Firm-sponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\n\nAdditionally, the Firm may invest in beneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-securitizations and generally purchases these interests in the secondary market. In these circumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral ability to direct the most significant activities of the resecuritization trust, either because it was not involved in the initial design of the trust, or the Firm was involved with an independent third-party sponsor and demonstrated shared power over the creation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not consolidate the re-securitization VIE.",

The conduits fund their financing facilities through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary source of repayment of the commercial paper is the cash flows from the pools of assets. In most instances, the assets are structured with dealspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits by the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third parties. Dealspecific credit enhancements are generally structured to cover a multiple of historical losses expected on the pool of assets, and are typically in the form of overcollateralization provided by the seller. The deal-specific credit enhancements mitigate the Firm's potential losses on its agreements with the conduits.\n\nTo ensure timely repayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the conduits with funding to provide financing to customers in the event that the conduits do not obtain funding in the commercial paper market, each asset pool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% dealspecific liquidity facility associated with it provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit vehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity facilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the form of standby letters of credit. The amount of program-wide credit enhancement required is based upon commercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the outstanding balance of commercial paper.\n\nThe Firm consolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the significant activities of the conduits and a potentially significant economic interest in the conduits. As administrative agent and in its role in structuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions regarding asset types and credit quality, and manages the commercial paper funding needs of the conduits. The Firm's interests that could potentially be significant to the VIEs include the fees received as administrative agent and liquidity and program-wide credit enhancement provider, as well as the potential exposure created by the liquidity and credit enhancement facilities provided to the conduits.\n\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $13.8 billion and $13.7 billion of the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm's investments reflect the Firm's funding needs and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.\n\nDeal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firmadministered multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded commitments were $10.6 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend credit.

In a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases highly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities: (1) puttable floating-rate certificates ('floaters') and (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests ('residuals'). The floaters are typically purchased by money market funds or other short-term investors and may be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB trust. The residuals are retained by the investor seeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB transactions where the residual is held by a third-party investor are typically known as customer TOB trusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions where the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB transactions. The Firm may provide various services to a TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider, and/or sponsor.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the floaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is responsible for establishing the periodic variable rate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement and remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing agent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in floaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material during 2022 and 2021.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or J.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole liquidity or tender option provider for the TOB trusts. The liquidity provider's obligation to perform is conditional and is limited by certain events",

        "page_content": "('Termination Events'), which include bankruptcy or failure to pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds or the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider's exposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess collateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual holders.\n\nHolders of the floaters may 'put,' or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the\n\nliquidity provider either provides a loan to the TOB trust for the TOB trust's purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters.\n\nTOB trusts are considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the Residual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be significant to the municipal bond vehicle.\n\n## Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities\n\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                                         | Assets          | Assets      | Assets   | Assets    | Liabilities       | Liabilities                              | Liabilities   | Liabilities        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| December 31, 2022 (in millions)         | Trading  assets | Loans       |          | Other (c) | Total  assets (d) | Beneficial  interests in  VIE assets (e) | Other (f)     | Total  liabilities |\n| VIE program type                        |                 |             |          |           |                   |                                          |               |                    |\n| Firm-sponsored credit card trusts       | $               | -  $  9,699 |          | $  100  $ | 9,799             | $  1,999  $                              |               | 2  $  2,001        |\n| Firm-administered multi-seller conduits | -               | 22,819      |          | 170       | 22,989            | 9,236                                    | 39            | 9,275              |\n| Municipal bond vehicles                 | 2,089           | -           |          | 7         | 2,096             | 1,232                                    | 10            | 1,242              |\n| Mortgage securitization entities (a)    | -               | 781         |          | 10        | 791               | 143                                      | 67            | 210                |\n| Other                                   | 62              | 1,112       | (b)      | 263       | 1,437             | -                                        | 161           | 161                |\n| Total                                   | $  2,151  $     | 34,411      |          | $  550  $ | 37,112            | $  12,610  $                             | 279  $        | 12,889             |\n\n|                                         | Assets         | Assets       | Assets   | Assets    | Liabilities       | Liabilities                              | Liabilities   | Liabilities        |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| December 31, 2021 (in millions)         | Trading assets | Loans        |          | Other (c) | Total  assets (d) | Beneficial  interests in  VIE assets (e) | Other (f)     | Total  liabilities |\n| VIE program type                        |                |              |          |           |                   |                                          |               |                    |\n| Firm-sponsored credit card trusts       | $              | -  $  11,108 |          | $  102  $ | 11,210            | $  2,397  $                              |               | 1  $  2,398        |\n| Firm-administered multi-seller conduits | 1              | 19,883       |          | 71        | 19,955            | 6,198                                    | 41            | 6,239              |\n| Municipal bond vehicles                 | 2,009          | -            |          | 2         | 2,011             | 1,976                                    | -             | 1,976              |\n| Mortgage securitization entities (a)    | -              | 955          |          | 32        | 987               | 179                                      | 85            | 264                |\n| Other                                   | -              | 1,078        | (b)      | 283       | 1,361             | -                                        | 118           | 118                |\n| Total                                   | $  2,010  $    | 33,024       |          | $  490  $ | 35,524            | $  10,750  $                             | 245  $        | 10,995             |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## VIEs sponsored by third parties\n\nThe Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm'slength, and individual credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction.\n\n## Tax credit vehicles\n\nThe Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $30.2 billion and $26.8 billion, of which $10.6 billion and $9.4 billion was unfunded at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.\n\n## Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts)\n\nThe Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle.\n\nThe Firm's maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $5.8 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $8.2 billion and $10.5 billion respectively.\n\n## Loan securitizations\n\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans. The purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the Firm.\n\nFor loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the transfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are met: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm's creditors; (2) the transferee or beneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not maintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred assets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the transferred assets).\n\nFor loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on the difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets received) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in noninterest revenue.",

The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser.

The Firm typically\n\nelects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed.

Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be an impairment.\n\nThe goodwill associated with each business combination is allocated to the related reporting units, which are generally determined based on how the Firm's businesses are managed and how they are reviewed. The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate.\n\n| December 31, (in millions)   | 2022      | 2021   | 2020               |\n|------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------------------|\n| Consumer & Community Banking | $  32,121 |        | $ 31,474  $ 31,311 |\n| Corporate & Investment Bank  | 8,008     | 7,906  | 7,913              |\n| Commercial Banking           | 2,985     | 2,986  | 2,985              |\n| Asset & Wealth Management    | 7,902     | 7,222  | 7,039              |\n| Corporate (a)                | 646       | 727    | -                  |\n| Total goodwill               | $  51,662 |        | $ 50,315  $ 49,248 |\n\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in  millions)                    | 2022      | 2021      |     | 2020      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----|-----------|\n| Balance at beginning of period                            | $  50,315 | $  49,248 |     | $  47,823 |\n| Changes during the period from: Business combinations (a) | 1,426     | 1,073     | (c) | 1,412     |\n| Other (b)                                                 | (79)      | (6)       | (c) | 13        |\n| Balance at December 31,                                   | $  51,662 | $  50,315 |     | $  49,248 |\n\n## Goodwill impairment testing\n\nThe Firm's goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 .\n\nThe goodwill impairment test is generally performed by comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the carrying value, then the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recognized\n\nfor the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nThe Firm uses the reporting units' allocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible assets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity for the reporting units in the goodwill impairment testing. Reporting unit equity is determined on a similar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs which takes into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed LOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firm's annual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm's Board of Directors and Operating Committee. Allocated capital is further reviewed at least annually and updated as needed.\n\nThe primary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair value of its reporting units is the income approach. This approach projects cash flows for the forecast period and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values, which are based on the reporting units' annual budgets and forecasts are then discounted using an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate used for each reporting unit represents an estimate of the cost of equity for that reporting unit and is determined considering the Firm's overall estimated cost of equity (estimated using the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted for the risk characteristics specific to each reporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk or uncertainty associated with the business or management's forecasts and assumptions). To assess the reasonableness of the discount rates used for each reporting unit, management compares the discount rate to the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded institutions with similar businesses and risk characteristics. In addition, the weighted average cost of equity (aggregating the various reporting units) is compared with the Firm's overall estimated cost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The valuations derived from the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared with market-based trading and transaction multiples for relevant competitors. Trading and transaction comparables are used as general indicators to assess the overall reasonableness of the estimated fair values, although precise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to the differences that naturally exist between the Firm's businesses and competitor institutions.\n\nThe Firm also takes into consideration a comparison between the aggregate fair values of the Firm's reporting units and JPMorgan Chase's market capitalization. In evaluating this comparison, the Firm considers several factors, including (i) a control premium that would exist in a market transaction, (ii) factors related to the level of execution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii) short-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm's reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill.\n\n## Mortgage servicing rights\n\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained.\n\nAs permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair value. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs used to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management purposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread ('OAS') model, which projects MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm's prepayment model, and then discounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other ancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.",

        "page_content": "The fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs typically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase prepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset. Conversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\n\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses combinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is to offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments.\n\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n| As of or for the year ended December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted)                | 2022     | 2021     | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------------|\n| Fair value at beginning of period                                                                   | $  5,494 | $  3,276 | $  4,699   |\n| MSR activity:                                                                                       |          |          |            |\n| Originations of MSRs                                                                                | 798      | 1,659    | 944        |\n| Purchase of MSRs                                                                                    | 1,400    | 1,363    | 248        |\n| Disposition of MSRs (a)                                                                             | (822)    | (114)    | (176)      |\n| Net additions/(dispositions)                                                                        | 1,376    | 2,908    | 1,016      |\n| Changes due to collection/realization of expected cash flows                                        | (936)    | (788)    | (899)      |\n| Changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions:                                                 |          |          |            |\n| Changes due to market interest rates and other (b)                                                  | 2,022    | 404      | (1,568)    |\n| Changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions:                                           |          |          |            |\n| Projected cash flows (e.g., cost to service)                                                        | 14       | 109      | (54)       |\n| Discount rates                                                                                      | -        | -        | 199        |\n| Prepayment model changes and other (c)                                                              | 3        | (415)    | (117)      |\n| Total changes in valuation due to other inputs and assumptions                                      | 17       | (306)    | 28         |\n| Total changes in valuation due to inputs and assumptions                                            | 2,039    | 98       | (1,540)    |\n| Fair value at December 31,                                                                          | $  7,973 | $  5,494 | $  3,276   |\n| Change in unrealized gains/(losses) included in income related to MSRs held at December 31,         | $  2,039 | $  98    | $  (1,540) |\n| Contractual service fees, late fees and other ancillary fees included in income                     | 1,535    | 1,298    | 1,325      |\n| Third-party mortgage loans serviced at December 31, (in billions)                                   | 584      | 520      | 448        |\n| Servicer advances, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts, at December 31, (in billions) (d) | 0.8      | 1.6      | 1.8        |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 18 - Leases\n\n## Firm as lessee\n\nAt December 31, 2022, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries were obligated under a number of noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases for premises and equipment used primarily for business purposes. These leases generally have terms of 20 years or less, determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is reasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are reported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use ('ROU') asset. None of these lease agreements impose restrictions on the Firm's ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or enter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental payments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease payments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components.\n\nOperating lease liabilities and ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The future lease payments are discounted at a rate that estimates the Firm's collateralized borrowing rate for financing instruments of a similar term and are included in accounts payable and other liabilities. The operating lease ROU asset, included in premises and equipment, also includes any lease prepayments made, plus initial direct costs incurred, less any lease incentives received. Rental expense associated with operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and generally included in occupancy expense in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe following tables provide information related to the Firm's operating leases:\n\n| December 31, (in millions, except where otherwise noted)                                        | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Right-of-use assets                                                                             | $  7,782 | $  7,888 |\n| Lease liabilities                                                                               | 8,183    | 8,328    |\n| Weighted average remaining lease term (in  years)                                               | 8.4      | 8.5      |\n| Weighted average discount rate                                                                  | 3.55 %   | 3.40 %   |\n| Supplemental cash flow information                                                              |          |          |\n| Cash paid for amounts included in the  measurement of lease liabilities - operating  cash flows | $  1,613 | $  1,656 |\n| Supplemental non-cash information                                                               |          |          |\n| Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange  for operating lease obligations                       | $  1,435 | $  1,167 |\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Rental expense                           |          |          |\n| Gross rental expense                     | $  2,079 | $  2,086 |\n| Sublease rental income                   | (119)    | (129)    |\n| Net rental expense                       | $  1,960 | $  1,957 |\n\nThe following table presents future payments under operating leases as of December 31, 2022:\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)   |              |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|\n| 2023                                    | $  1,572     |\n| 2024                                    | 1,433        |\n| 2025 2026                               | 1,273  1,034 |\n| 2027                                    | 887          |\n| After 2027                              | 3,382        |\n| Total future minimum lease payments     | 9,581        |\n| Less: Imputed interest                  | (1,398)      |\n| Total                                   | $  8,183     |\n\nIn addition to the table above, as of December 31, 2022, the Firm had additional future operating lease commitments of $588 million that were signed but had not yet commenced.

In order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The use of these instruments modifies the Firm's interest expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-average interest rates for total long-term debt, including the effects of related derivative instruments, were 4.89% and 1.43% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These guarantees rank on parity with the Firm's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes was $28.2 billion and $16.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nThe Firm's unsecured debt does not contain requirements that would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the structure of the existing debt, provide any limitations on future borrowings or require additional collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm's credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock price.",

In the second half of 2022, as a result of the expected increases in regulatory capital requirements, the Firm temporarily suspended share repurchases. In the first quarter of 2023, the Firm resumed repurchasing shares under its common share repurchase program.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Firm's repurchases of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions)                 | 2022    | 2021 (a)          | 2020 (b)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|------------|\n| Total number of shares of common  stock repurchased   | 23.1    | 119.7             | 50.0       |\n| Aggregate purchase price of  common stock repurchases | $ 3,122 | $ 18,448  $ 6,397 |            |\n\nThe Board of Directors' authorization to repurchase common shares is utilized at management's discretion, and the timing of purchases and the exact amount of common shares that may be repurchased is subject to various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm's capital position (taking into account goodwill and intangibles); internal capital generation; and alternative investment opportunities. The $30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board does not establish specific price targets or timetables. The repurchase program may be suspended by management at any time; and may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, or utilizing Rule 10b5-1 plans, which are written trading plans that the Firm may enter into from time to time under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and which allow the Firm to repurchase its common shares during periods when it may otherwise not be repurchasing common shares - for example, during internal trading blackout periods.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, approximately 58.9 million shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under various employee incentive, compensation, option and stock purchase plans, and directors' compensation plans.",

Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan Chase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation programs, predominantly all of which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the Firm's common stock. These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, and they are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not included as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS; refer to Note 9 for additional information.\n\nDiluted EPS incorporates the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. For each of the periods presented in the table below, diluted EPS calculated under the two-class method was more dilutive.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of net income applicable to common stockholders and basic and diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n| Year ended December 31, (in millions,  except per share amounts)                                       | 2022      | 2021        | 2020                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                               |           |             |                      |\n| Net income                                                                                             | $  37,676 |             | $  48,334  $  29,131 |\n| Less: Preferred stock dividends                                                                        | 1,595     | 1,600       | 1,583                |\n| Net income applicable to common  equity                                                                | 36,081    | 46,734      | 27,548               |\n| Less: Dividends and undistributed  earnings allocated to participating  securities                     | 189       | 231         | 138                  |\n| Net income applicable to common  stockholders                                                          | $  35,892 |             | $  46,503  $  27,410 |\n| Total weighted-average basic shares  outstanding                                                       | 2,965.8   |             | 3,021.5    3,082.4   |\n| Net income per share                                                                                   | $  12.10  | $  15.39  $ | 8.89                 |\n| Diluted earnings per share                                                                             |           |             |                      |\n| Net income applicable to common  stockholders                                                          | $  35,892 |             | $  46,503  $  27,410 |\n| Total weighted-average basic shares  outstanding                                                       | 2,965.8   |             | 3,021.5    3,082.4   |\n| Add: Dilutive impact of SARs and  employee stock options, unvested  PSUs and nondividend-earning  RSUs | 4.2       | 5.1         | 5.0                  |\n| Total weighted-average diluted  shares outstanding                                                     | 2,970.0   |             | 3,026.6    3,087.4   |\n| Net income per share                                                                                   | $  12.09  | $  15.36  $ | 8.88                 |",

JPMorgan Chase uses the asset and liability method to provide for income taxes on all transactions recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. This method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized. JPMorgan Chase's expense for income taxes includes the current and deferred portions of that expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm expects to realize.\n\nDue to the inherent complexities arising from the nature of the Firm's businesses, and from conducting business and being taxed in a substantial number of jurisdictions, significant judgments and estimates are required to be made. Agreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase and the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files tax returns may not be finalized for several years. Thus, the Firm's final tax-related assets and liabilities may ultimately be different from those currently reported.\n\n## Effective tax rate and expense\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the applicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the effective tax rate.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\n| Year ended December 31,                                                     | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Statutory U.S. federal tax rate                                             | 21.0 % | 21.0 % | 21.0 % |\n| Increase/(decrease) in tax rate  resulting from:                            |        |        |        |\n| U.S. state and local income  taxes, net of U.S. federal  income tax benefit | 3.5    | 3.0    | 2.5    |\n| Tax-exempt income                                                           | (0.9)  | (0.9)  | (1.6)  |\n| Non-U.S. earnings                                                           | 0.4    | 0.1    | 1.4    |\n| Business tax credits                                                        | (5.4)  | (4.2)  | (5.4)  |\n| Other, net                                                                  | (0.2)  | (0.1)  | 0.8    |\n| Effective tax rate                                                          | 18.4 % | 18.9 % | 18.7 % |\n\nThe following table reflects the components of income tax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Income tax expense/(benefit)\n\n| Year ended December 31,  (in millions)            | 2022     | 2021      | 2020     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| Current income tax expense/ (benefit)             |          |           |          |\n| U.S. federal                                      | $  5,606 | $  2,865  | $  5,759 |\n| Non-U.S.                                          | 2,992    | 2,718     | 2,705    |\n| U.S. state and local                              | 2,630    | 1,897     | 1,793    |\n| Total current income tax expense/ (benefit)       | 11,228   | 7,480     | 10,257   |\n| Deferred income tax expense/ (benefit)            |          |           |          |\n| U.S. federal                                      | (2,004)  | 3,460     | (2,776)  |\n| Non-U.S.                                          | (154)    | (101)     | (126)    |\n| U.S. state and local                              | (580)    | 389       | (671)    |\n| Total deferred income tax       expense/(benefit) | (2,738)  | 3,748     | (3,573)  |\n| Total income tax expense                          | $  8,490 | $  11,228 | $  6,684 |\n\nTotal income tax expense includes $331 million of tax benefits in 2022, $69 million of tax expenses in 2021, and $72 million of tax benefits in 2020, resulting from the resolution of tax audits.\n\nTax effect of items recorded in stockholders' equity The preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of certain items that are recorded each period directly in stockholders' equity.

The amount of amortization of such investments reported in income tax expense was $1.4 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Included in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits are certain items that would not affect the effective tax rate if they were recognized in the Consolidated statements of income. These unrecognized items include the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the benefit from associated U.S. federal income tax deductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S. unrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in other jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase evaluates the need for changes in unrecognized tax benefits based on its anticipated tax return filing positions as part of its U.S. federal and state and local tax returns. In addition, the Firm is presently under audit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably by the Internal Revenue Service, as summarized in the Tax examination status table below. The evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits as well as the potential for audit settlements make it reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the gross balance of unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease by as much as approximately $1.0 billion.

In addition, unless collateralized with cash or US Government debt obligations, covered transactions are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary's total capital, as determined by the riskbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of its affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary's total capital.\n\nThe Parent Company's two principal subsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the 'IHC'). The IHC generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase's subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany loans to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).\n\nThe principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in statutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity 'thresholds' are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company's management or Board of Directors.\n\nAt January 1, 2023, the Parent Company's banking subsidiaries could pay, in the aggregate, approximately $34 billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies without the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2023 will be supplemented by the banking subsidiaries' earnings during the year.",

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ('OCC') establishes similar minimum capital requirements and standards for the Firm's principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\n\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding companies and banks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized approach ('Basel III Standardized'), and an advanced approach ('Basel III Advanced'). For each of the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements.\n\nThe three components of regulatory capital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnder the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI subsidiaries are also subject to these capital requirements established by their respective primary regulators .\n\nThe following table presents the risk-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                           | Standardized capital  ratio requirements ratio requirements   | Standardized capital  ratio requirements ratio requirements   | Advanced capital          | Advanced capital   | Well-capitalized  ratios   | Well-capitalized  ratios   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                           | BHC (a)(b)                                                    | IDI (c)                                                       | BHC (a)                   | IDI (c)            | BHC (d)                    | IDI (e)                    |\n| Risk-based capital ratios | Risk-based capital ratios                                     | Risk-based capital ratios                                     | Risk-based capital ratios |                    |                            |                            |\n| CET1 capital              | 12.0 %                                                        | 7.0 %                                                         | 10.5 %                    | 7.0 %              | NA                         | 6.5 %                      |\n| Tier 1  capital           | 13.5                                                          | 8.5                                                           | 12.0                      | 8.5                | 6.0 %                      | 8.0                        |\n| Total capital             | 15.5                                                          | 10.5                                                          | 14.0                      | 10.5               | 10.0                       | 10.0                       |\n\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n\nThe following table presents the leverage-based regulatory capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n|                               | Capital ratio  requirements (a)   | Capital ratio  requirements (a)   | Well-capitalized  ratios   | Well-capitalized  ratios   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                               | BHC                               | IDI                               | BHC (b)                    | IDI                        |\n| Leverage-based capital ratios |                                   |                                   |                            |                            |\n| Tier 1 leverage               | 4.0 %                             | 4.0 %                             | NA                         | 5.0 %                      |\n| SLR                           | 5.0                               | 6.0                               | NA                         | 6.0                        |\n\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 28 - Off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees, and other commitments\n\nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm's view, representative of its expected future credit exposure or funding requirements.\n\nTo provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60 days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.",

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nU.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount equal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a contract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an underlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party's failure to perform under a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off-balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under U.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain indemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and the guarantees under the sponsored member repo program.\n\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records guarantees at the inception date fair value of the noncontingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of consideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records this fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received),\n\nor other assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is received under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as lending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation is recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\n\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably estimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any non-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related contingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds is allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For these indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm's risk is reduced (i.e., over time or when the indemnification expires).\n\nThe contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications are included in the table on page 277.\n\nFor additional information on the guarantees, see below.\n\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade financings and similar transactions.\n\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n## Standby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n\n|                                           | 2022                                                      | 2022                     | 2021                                                      | 2021                     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| December 31, (in millions)                | Standby letters of credit and  other financial guarantees | Other letters  of credit | Standby letters of credit and  other financial guarantees | Other letters  of credit |\n| Investment-grade (a)                      | $  19,205                                                 | $  3,040                 | $  19,998                                                 | $  3,087                 |\n| Noninvestment-grade (a)                   | 8,234                                                     | 1,094                    | 8,532                                                     | 1,361                    |\n| Total contractual amount                  | $  27,439                                                 | $  4,134                 | $  28,530                                                 | $  4,448                 |\n| Allowance for lending-related commitments | $  82                                                     | $  6                     | $  123                                                    | $  9                     |\n| Guarantee liability                       | 326                                                       | -                        | 353                                                       | -                        |\n| Total carrying value                      | $  408                                                    | $  6                     | $  476                                                    | $  9                     |\n| Commitments with collateral               | $  15,296                                                 | $  795                   | $  14,511                                                 | $  999                   |",

        "page_content": "## Securities lending indemnifications\n\nThrough the Firm's securities lending program, counterparties' securities, via custodial and non-custodial arrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of this program, the Firm provides an indemnification in the lending agreements which protects the lender against the failure of the borrower to return the lent securities. To minimize its liability under these indemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or other highly liquid collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan from the borrower. Collateral is marked to market daily to help assure that collateralization is adequate. Additional collateral is called from the borrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be released to the borrower in the event of overcollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the Firm would use the collateral held to purchase replacement securities in the market or to credit the lending client or counterparty with the cash equivalent thereof.\n\nThe cash collateral held by the Firm may be invested on behalf of the client in indemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm indemnifies the client against the loss of principal invested. To minimize its liability under these agreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market value exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\n\n## Derivatives qualifying as guarantees\n\nThe Firm transacts in certain derivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP. These contracts include written put options that require the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by the option holder at a specified price by a specified date in the future. The Firm may enter into written put option contracts in order to meet client needs, or for other trading purposes. The terms of written put options are typically five years or less.\n\nDerivatives deemed to be guarantees also includes stable value contracts, commonly referred to as 'stable value products', that require the Firm to make a payment of the difference between the market value and the book value of a counterparty's reference portfolio of assets in the event that market value is less than book value and certain other conditions have been met. Stable value products are transacted in order to allow investors to realize investment returns with less volatility than an unprotected portfolio. These contracts are typically longer-term or may have no stated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to terminate the contract under certain conditions.\n\nThe notional value of derivative guarantees generally represents the Firm's maximum exposure. However, exposure to certain stable value products is contractually limited to a substantially lower percentage of the notional amount.\n\nThe fair value of derivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the Firm's view, of whether the Firm will be required to perform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures to these contracts by entering into offsetting transactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge the market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\n\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\n\n| (in millions)                                                                    | December 31,  2022   | December 31,  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Notional amounts                                                                 |                      |                      |\n| Derivative guarantees                                                            | $  59,180            | $  55,730            |\n| Stable value contracts with  contractually limited exposure                      | 31,820               | 29,778               |\n| Maximum exposure of stable  value contracts with  contractually limited exposure | 2,063                | 2,882                |\n| Fair value                                                                       |                      |                      |\n| Derivative payables                                                              | 649                  | 475                  |\n\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit derivatives.\n\n## Unsettled securities financing agreements\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into resale and securities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and receiving securities collateral from the counterparty. The Firm also enters into repurchase and securities loaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments result in the Firm receiving cash from and providing securities collateral to the counterparty. Such agreements settle at a future date. These agreements generally do not meet the definition of a derivative, and therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets until settlement date. These agreements predominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion of securities financing agreements.\n\n## Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications\n\n## Mortgage repurchase liability\n\nIn connection with the Firm's mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm.\n\n## Private label securitizations\n\nThe liability related to repurchase demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation reserves.\n\nRefer to Note 30 for additional information regarding litigation.\n\n## Loans sold with recourse\n\nThe Firm provides servicing for mortgages and certain commercial lending products on both a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse servicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is the cost of temporary servicing advances of funds (i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse servicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae",

Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on the loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm's securitizations are predominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. The unpaid principal balance of loans sold with recourse as well as the carrying value of the related liability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, which is representative of the Firm's view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse obligations, are disclosed in the table on page 277.\n\n## Other off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nIndemnification agreements - general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the U.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a change in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the securities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The Firm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients ('software licensees') or when it sells a business or assets to a third party ('thirdparty purchasers'), pursuant to which it indemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the software, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of the business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to be remote.\n\n## Merchant charge-backs\n\nUnder the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder's favor, the Firm will (through the cardholder's issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Firm processed an aggregate volume of $2,158.4 billion, $1,886.7 billion, and $1,597.3 billion, respectively.\n\n## Clearing Services - Client Credit Risk\n\nThe Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales and derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative contracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and securities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the relevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis based on the value of clients' derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative contract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract.\n\nAs a clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients for the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the collection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can also cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement. In the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client's positions and access available margin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to be paid by the Firm as a clearing member.\n\nThe Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client through the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients' underlying securities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would require an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical experience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.\n\nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Exchange & Clearing House Memberships\n\nThe Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and clearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership in some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization as a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations may be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm's contribution to the guarantee fund maintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a member default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata share of losses that may result from the clearing house's investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial margin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required should such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb the losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm's maximum possible exposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be made against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the risk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm's maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is disclosed in the table on page 277, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line.\n\n## Sponsored member repo program\n\nThe Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ('FICC') on behalf of clients that become sponsored members under the FICC's rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients' respective obligations under the FICC's rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm's maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 277. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.\n\n## Guarantees of subsidiaries\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Parent Company may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its subsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm's\n\ncounterparties. The obligations of the subsidiaries are included on the Firm's Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet commitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm believes that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees is remote.\n\nThe Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC ('JPMFC'), a 100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary of the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm's unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 277 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 for additional information.",

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm's lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories.\n\nThe Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $0 to approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given:\n\n- \u00b7 the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages,\n- \u00b7 the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined,\n- \u00b7 the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and\n- \u00b7 the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect.\n\nIn addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm's estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly.\n\nSet forth below are descriptions of the Firm's material legal proceedings.\n\n1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad ('1MDB'), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was served in August 2022. The claim alleges 'dishonest assistance' against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $300 million and $500 million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court's jurisdiction to hear the claim.\n\nAmrapali . India's Enforcement Directorate ('ED') is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by two offshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group ('Amrapali'). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers' petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $31.5 million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India's Prevention of Money Laundering Act ('PMLA') and Foreign Exchange Management Act ('FEMA'). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $25 million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation.\n\nFederal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria ('FGN') and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $1.1 billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria ('FRN') commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $875 million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN alleged that the payments were",

A trial was held between February and April 2022. In June 2022, the Court decided the case in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dismissed it in full. In November 2022, the Court refused permission to the FRN to appeal the dismissal, and the matter was concluded.\n\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange ('FX') sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ('ERISA') through the ten-year disqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South Africa Competition Tribunal.\n\nWith respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm's settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. A putative class action remains pending against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval.\n\nInterchange Litigation . Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on\n\nappeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.\n\nThe original class action was divided into two separate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court's approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $700 million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part.\n\nOf the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing over half of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visabranded payment card sales volume.\n\nJeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has moved to dismiss both complaints.\n\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association's ('BBA') London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR') for various currencies and the European Banking Federation's Euro Interbank Offered Rate ('EURIBOR'). The Swiss Competition Commission's investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that",

In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss. The Firm's settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval.\n\nSecurities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are opposing.\n\nShareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.\n\nCertain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm's resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust\n\nenrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss this action in full. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action.\n\nA separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm's compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm's subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending.\n\n*     *     *\n\nIn addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.\n\nThe Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management's best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm's legal expense was $266 million, $426 million and $1.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm's litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.",

JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm's consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase's operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase's income for that period.",

The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation as business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is based predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed, booking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm's U.S. operations serve international businesses.\n\nAs the Firm's operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have been made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations.

The Firm's definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and securities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the LOBs.\n\n## Segment results and reconciliation (a)\n\n(Table continued on next page)\n\n| As of or for the

capital by taking into consideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory capital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of a business segment's performance.\n\nThe Firm's allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel III Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change.",

The attribution between volume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in the table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 292-296 for more information on average balances and rates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to volume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in composition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated separately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net spread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result, changes in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result, and due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is inherently complex and judgmental.\n\n|                                                                                         | 2022 versus 2021

Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the origination date.\n\n## Current estimated LTV ratio\n\nAn estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using estimated collateral values derived from a nationally recognized home price index measured at the metropolitan statistical area ('MSA') level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to the extent available and forecasted data where actual data is not available. As a result, the estimated collateral values used to calculate these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed as estimates.\n\n## Combined LTV ratio\n\nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii) a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the Firm's Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not provide complete documentation of his or her assets or the amount or source of his or her income.\n\n## Option ARMs\n\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an adjustablerate mortgage loan that provides the borrower with the option each month to make a fully amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the interest rate charged during the introductory period. This introductory rate is usually significantly below the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the introductory period ends, the contractual interest rate charged on the loan increases to the fully indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements in the index. The minimum payment is typically insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\n\n## Prime\n\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good credit records who meet specific underwriting\n\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements related to income and overall debt levels.
