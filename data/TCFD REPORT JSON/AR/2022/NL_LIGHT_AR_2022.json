Geopolitical crises, COVID-19, persistent supply chain issues and surging energy costs conspired to create an increasingly volatile and unpredictable external environment that profoundly tested our agility and resilience.\n\nWhile the high volatility impacted our margins and cash, our teams at Signify adapted to the evolving realities and customer needs. In this context, our connected lighting and growth platforms grew to reach almost EUR 2 billion of sales in 2022, and we increased our total connected light points to 114 million globally. By the close of 2022, our two digital divisions had grown to represent more than 85% of sales, profit and cash, up from 80% in 2021.\n\nThe difficult conditions also testified to the relevance of Signify's extensive portfolio of sustainable and connected lighting solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWith climate change, the energy crisis hitting Europe and spiraling inflation creating a perfect storm, customers in all spheres recognize the urgent environmental and financial need to reduce energy consumption.\n\nIn 2022, we reinforced our leading position with the acquisition of Pierlite - which broadened our offer and market coverage in the Pacific region - and Fluence, which enriched our technology portfolio and bolstered our agriculture lighting growth platform in North America. This diversity in our global footprint builds our resilience in challenging markets and expands our business into promising new segments.\n\n## Brighter lives and a better world\n\nWith the climate emergency ever more urgent, it is clear to me that continuing to prioritize and focus relentlessly on sustainability in the past 10 years and again in\n\n2022 has been the right strategy. More than ever, the world needs sustainable technology innovation that will help mitigate the challenges around us: for example, our Ultra Efficient LED range which cuts current LED electricity use by at least half; or our 3Dprinted luminaires made from waste fishing nets, which reduce ocean plastic, and for which we won a Gold IDEA design award in 2022.\n\nMore broadly, Signify's Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program sets bold targets across the areas of climate action, circularity, and societal impact. We are proud to have pioneered reporting in these areas, measuring the percentage of our annual sales that have a direct, positive impact on the world's greatest challenges. At the end of 2022, our Brighter lives revenues were at 27%, our Circular revenues at 29% and our Climate action revenues at 65%.",

We also issued our first Climate Action Report, further underscoring our pioneering commitment and robust approach. With the industry and the world now joining the sprint towards sustainability, we will continue to set the bar ever higher.\n\nIn terms of societal impact, we published our first-ever dedicated report on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Signify, in which we confirmed we have achieved gender pay equity, meaning that people throughout our organization are paid equitably for the same or similar work. Given that the world saw gender equality take backward steps during the pandemic, in terms of women's participation in the workforce and a widening wage gap, I am proud that people throughout our organization are paid equitably for the same or similar work, and that we continue to increase our representation of women.\n\nThis progress and leadership in sustainability was recognized externally again. We featured in Euronext's first AEX ESG Index, based on Sustainalytics data which places Signify in the top 1% of our industry. We secured our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and the CDP Climate A-list for the sixth year running.\n\n## Designing our future\n\nOur long history of lighting innovation is a source of great pride within Signify. It is the essence of what we do and how we build for the future. Last year, we invested 3.9% of our sales in R&D, structured within a threehorizon investment schedule - investing in what is stable, what is growing, and what will grow tomorrow.\n\nWe continue to innovate in core LED lighting products that meet the world's immediate need to reduce energy consumption. To cite some examples: we have expanded our Ultra Efficient LED portfolio and extended it into the professional sector, offering even greater savings to energy-conscious customers. In luminaires, embracing 3D\n\nprinting is making supply chain, procurement, manufacturing, and development more sustainable and more efficient.\n\nOur investment in the Internet of Things is bearing fruit, with us now having surpassed 100 million IoT connected devices. And on the consumer side, our WiZ and Philips Hue lamps were the first in the lighting industry to support the Matter standard for smart home interoperability.\n\n## Delivering for customers\n\nWe aim to delight our customers with bold and sustainable innovations that improve lives. This, however, rests on our ability to deliver what we promise. In 2022, we experienced significant market and supply chain disruption that impacted our deliveries and impacted our customers.\n\nWe recognized the issues early on and rapidly corrected our path, making improvements to customer service and order and delivery processes. While order and delivery satisfaction still fell short of the standard we aim for, a steadily recovering transactional\n\nNet Promoter Score for both B2B and B2C customers suggests we took the right actions.\n\n## Driving digital transformation\n\nEven through the complexities of 2022, we continued to prioritize digital transformation initiatives, almost doubling our investment to deliver meaningful progress at speed. Our digital transformation roadmap focuses on three areas: processes, customer interfaces, and product offerings.\n\nOn the processes side, our investment in an advanced Integrated Business Planning (IBP) digital platform is enabling us to create a more reliable, resilient, and agile supply chain, combining demand, inventory, and supply planning in a single end-to-end cloud-based solution. Through IBP, we are better able to bring customers the right part at the right time and location, with optimal efficiencies.\n\nWe continue to make strong progress on digitalizing our customer interfaces to reach customers on their terms.

With more than 34,600 employees, a presence in 74 countries and our sales covering a global market, our purpose is to unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world .\n\nWe have pioneered many key breakthroughs in lighting over the past 130 years and have been a driving force behind several leading technological innovations. Signify continues to innovate in LED lighting and is leading the industry's expansion to lighting systems in both the professional and consumer markets. Our position as industry leader in connected lighting, makes Signify the lighting company for the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\n## Strategic context\n\nGlobal growth has been impacted by political and economic disruptions that have emerged in the current year. On top of resource scarcity and supply disruptions from last year, heightened geopolitical tensions have contributed to abnormal inflation levels and energy costs. We are seeing a shift towards energy-efficient solutions, driven by consumers tackling rising costs and looking for more sustainable solutions. These key trends have a direct impact on our operations and reflect the need to remain agile in an evolving environment.\n\nEvery year, Signify performs a Strategic Review Process, combined with a sound Sustainability Materiality Assessment (more can be found in chapter 16, Sustainability statements). These processes involve a large number of internal and external stakeholders and help us identify future trends and understand stakeholders' perspectives at a global and local level. This helps us to better manage the risks and opportunities that could impact our ability to create value in the long term.\n\nAs a result of our annual review in 2022, and despite the challenging environment requiring acceleration in some areas, our focus on delivering on our 5 Frontiers strategy and progressing on our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 commitments is more relevant than ever.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The new location is part of EDGE Amsterdam West, a redevelopment of a unique 1970s building, structured around a central green atrium with a striking glass roof. Completed in 2021, the building is designed to the highest standards of sustainability, office health, and innovation. Even away from the bright, central space, it's still possible to enjoy the energizing properties of natural daylight in rooms equipped with NatureConnect. Built on biophilic design principles, NatureConnect uses a combination of LED luminaires and intuitive lighting controls to create a fully immersive experience that brings the feeling of the outdoors into the office. By supporting the body's natural rhythms, NatureConnect supports productivity and well-being at Signify by helping colleagues stay alert and productive by day and rest well at night.\n\n'Customers who visit the office are blown away when they experience NatureConnect. This dynamic natural light system boosts the health and well-being of professionals working indoors. Customers also love the skylight luminaire, which gives the impression of being directly underneath the blue sky while deep inside a building. We often get the feedback that people expect birds or planes to fly over, which shows how closely it mimics a real-life setting.'\n\nWouter Boxhoorn, Global Business Development Manager, NatureConnect\n\nBeautiful examples of Signify's lighting design can be discovered throughout our offices, from subtle luminous surfaces to eye-catching 3D printed luminaires, which are recyclable and support a circular economy. And the lighting is doing far more than illuminating the space. UVC disinfection upper air luminaires purify the air throughout the day, neutralizing bacteria, viruses, and other airborne pathogens. Employees can connect to fast, secure internet through Trulifi, which offers exceptional speed, stability and security through light, or book a workstation through Interact Workspace, an extension of the Interact connected lighting system that works behind the scenes to manage lighting and other smart building features in Signify's offices and throughout the entire building. The Interact system supports the building's impressive sustainability credentials, bringing together energy performance and usage data to optimize, automate and remotely manage lighting throughout the building. This combination of the aesthetic and the practical creates a beautiful, functional workplace where employees can thrive.\n\nEDGE Amsterdam West is just one of the Signify offices around the world that benefits from our own technology. At the end of 2022, 86 Signify offices, from Guangzhou to Burlington, had been upgraded with UV-C disinfection lighting, Interact, NatureConnect or Trulifi.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatureConnect/3D/UV-C/Trulifi/Interact - Signify Amsterdam office - the Netherlands\n\n<!-- image -->",

National airline Emirates flies from the city to more than 100 destinations in 60 countries every day - serving up as many as 200,000 meals in the process. That's a challenge when it comes to fresh vegetables: the harsh desert climate is not conducive to cultivating leafy greens. But flying in fragile crops from other countries is inefficient and unsustainable.\n\nThe solution? Bustanica, the largest vertical farm in the world. Located near Al Maktoum International Airport, the three-hectare indoor farm consists of 27 grow rooms, each with its own climate system, controls, and special LED lighting from Signify. Different LED lights are used at different stages of plant development, with lights tailored specifically for the indoor crops.\n\nThe state-of-the-art hydroponic facility can produce more than one million kilograms of high-quality leafy greens each year using up to 95% less water than conventional agriculture, saving 250 million liters of water every year compared to traditional outdoor farming.\n\nThe farm's focus on water security supports the UAE's Water Security Strategy 2036 agenda. Accelerating self-sufficiency in fresh food produce, supporting sustainability, and long-term food security are top priorities for the UAE.\n\nVertical farming techniques and innovative technologies used at the facility eliminate the use of pesticides, chemicals, herbicides, and fungicides. This way, Emirates can ensure a clean, hygienic and tasty product for its passengers in a sustainable and repeatable way.\n\n'The superior performance of the lights we use is specifically tailored to the plants we're cultivating, allowing them to grow to their optimum nutritious best. Lighting is such an important part of the entire functioning of the farm. These lights perform strongly in terms of power use, growing efficacy, and the number of lights required to achieve that.'\n\nKieran Dowd, Vice-president of Sourcing Solutions, Emirates Flight Catering\n\n<!-- image -->",

Members of the 69 gyms across the UK needed a training environment that was welcoming, easy to navigate, and could inspire a great workout. And Frasers Group needed a solution that was energy-efficient, consistent across locations, and easy to manage.\n\nThe result is both visually striking and immensely practical. Bold chevrons, lines and squares in the ceiling entice members to distinct innovative zones within the space. Contemporary luminaires from Modular Lighting Instruments create soft, functional light with a clean, minimalist design. And tailor-made 3D printed pendant and projector lights offer oneof-a-kind designs to suit the needs of each location, also contributing to a circular economy.\n\nEverlast's lighting creates a high-energy atmosphere, but not a high energy cost. By designing with LED, the clubs can use just a fraction of the electricity previously needed to power the traditional lighting that was there before. Behind the scenes, the Interact connected lighting system with multisite management capability centralizes lighting controls for a consistent look and feel across clubs and efficient maintenance planning.\n\n\"Our first elevated sites reflect our ambitions for Everlast Gyms and perfectly demonstrate the gym experience we aim to bring to all of our members throughout the UK. We needed to make sure that the lighting added to the look and feel of the club, while also keeping the facility environmentally friendly. It's been great to switch on these solutions and I'm looking forward to working with Signify on the rollout across the UK.\"\n\nDaniel Summerson, Managing Director of Everlast Gyms, Frasers Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nModular Lighting/3D - Everlast gyms - UK\n\n<!-- image -->",

The public experience was the starting point of the design for a project completed in 2022 that transforms the venue into a multi-purpose arena combining sport with entertainment such as shows, events, gastronomy, art and culture.\n\nSignify partnered with construction company WTorre Entertainment and stadium owner Palmeiras to deliver intelligent dynamic lighting technology for the stadium in S\u00e3o Paulo. The new system consists of 180 Philips ArenaVision LED luminaires for field lighting, replacing 274 conventional ones. The result is a vibrant experience for arena-goers, and is expected to generate more than 70% savings on electricity and maintenance costs.\n\nThe state-of-the-art technology improves luminosity on the pitch and so increases comfort for players and the public. Excellent uniformity of horizontal and vertical light without flicker effects mean higher quality for HD television broadcasts, and there's a memorable light show to impress both those present in the stadium and people watching on TV.\n\nIt's the first time a Brazilian stadium has installed the Interact Sports management system, which enables flexible, multipurpose venues with optimal lighting across all areas of the stadium. This IoT platform provides real-time intelligent lighting control via software and dashboard insights generation and so enables immersive experiences through lighting, with different scenes and effects.\n\nInteract enables lighting to be integrated into sound systems, synchronized with music, and provide enhanced fan experiences at arenas and at home. Allianz Parque has now taken its place alongside top world stadiums that already use the technology, such as Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena in Germany and Juventus' Allianz Stadium in Italy.\n\n\"We chose Signify for the brand's confidence and the team's support and commitment to enable a project that further improves the experience of visiting Allianz Parque and takes us a step further in our sustainability goals. This type of project has no room for error, so a solid and reliable partner was critical.\"\n\nCl\u00e1udio Macedo, CEO of WTorre Entertainment and Allianz Parque Arena",

It is home to some of the world's great artistic, religious and cultural treasures and is an artistic work in its own right, with its fifteenth-century white marble fa\u00e7ade presiding gracefully over the Piazza Santa Maria Novella.\n\nFirenze Smart, the public company responsible for the Italian city's smart services, aimed to combine sensitivity to this historic landmark with the benefits of modern, energy-saving LED technology and the vitality and artistic possibilities of dynamic lighting. To achieve this, they selected and installed 12 Color Kinetics ReachElite IntelliHue LED projectors, paired with Signify's Interact connected lighting control system.\n\nThe IntelliHue lights offered the ability to finely tune shades of white to create exactly the right perception of the quality and uniformity of the fa\u00e7ade. A cooler white was selected for the fa\u00e7ade than for the surrounding square and historic center, with a warm white picking out the iconic sun decoration. The underlying control and flexibility of Interact and Color Kinetics makes it possible to bring the fa\u00e7ade to life with colorful and dynamic scenes for holidays and special occasions.\n\nAs well as highlighting the artistic and cultural value of the building, this solution transforms Florence into a smart, dynamic city with even greater energy efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Yet even with the gradual return to everyday life in many countries, high hygiene standards are set to remain a cornerstone of social coexistence. With that in mind, the Bad D\u00fcrkheim district in Germany was keen to equip busy public spaces with cost-effective, future-proof disinfection solutions that could be seamlessly integrated into the existing environment.\n\nFour primary schools, seven daycare centers, two after-school care centers, and parts of the Bad D\u00fcrkheim town hall were equipped with Philips UV-C disinfection devices from Signify. The municipality used a total of 15 Philips UVCA200 mobile disinfection units and a further 85 Philips SM345C Upper Air UV-C ceiling mounted devices.\n\nLocal electricians completed special UV-C training courses before installing the devices with careful attention to aspects such as the size, specificities and aesthetics of the individual rooms. They used photos, sketches and cross-sections to ensure seamless integration of the disinfection units.\n\nThe ultraviolet light used in UV-C technology inactivates viruses, bacteria and germs by breaking down the DNA and/or RNA of microorganisms. By investing on a municipal scale in this comprehensive infection protection against germs and viruses, Bad D\u00fcrkheim is investing in long-term hygiene, health and well-being for its citizens.\n\n'We thought long and hard about exactly how we could make our schools, daycare centers, after-school care centers and the town hall safer and more hygienic places.

Allen or Long-Allen Bridge, commonly known as the Texas Street Bridge, connects Shreveport and Bossier City in Louisiana, USA. Over time, the bridge's neon lighting system had begun to fail, taking with it an important sense of vibrancy and community pride.\n\nSo, the Shreveport Regional Arts Council (SRAC) recruited a team of local artists, designers, and IT professionals to create a new lighting solution that would rejuvenate the region.\n\nCompleted in February 2022, Color Kinetics Blast Powercore, IntelliHue luminaires illuminate the bridge's steel structure. The Interact Landmark platform controls the interactive system, with its constantly morphing colors, shapes and forms. Color Kinetics Data Enabler Pro supplies power and data.\n\nOnce the installation was in place, it became a flexible artistic canvas to enrich the community. Young people can join a certified\n\nresidency program and get hands-on experience operating the bridge's lighting controls. People can 'adopt a light', picking colors for special celebrations, announcements, or causes. And during the Art Break festival, SRAC invited the public to use coloring sheets to show how they'd like to see the bridge lit during the event. Hundreds of submissions were scanned into the system and played during a special 20minute light show.\n\nThe unique interactive public art installation has transformed the bridge into a stunning canvas of light that illuminates the river, drives economic development, and breathes new life into the connecting cities.\n\n'Signify and Color Kinetics offered the best products for the project, providing the flexibility to challenge our talented lighting designers to produce a diversity of light shows and excite our community.'\n\nPam Atchison, Executive Director, SRAC\n\n'We haven't just lighted a bridge, we've lighted lives.'\n\nJason Lyons, Resident Lighting Designer, SRAC",

WiZ removes those hurdles, opening up automations and other advanced benefits of smart lighting to everyone.\n\nSpaceSense is a new innovation in consumer lighting developed by WiZ. For the first time, consumers can enjoy the benefits of motionbased lighting automation, straight out of the box.\n\nSpaceSense uses Wi-Fi signals already present in the room to detect motion, so there's no need for dedicated sensors and batteries. WiFi signals are slightly disturbed when people move around in a room, like a ripple in a swimming pool.\n\nBy measuring the small deviations in signal strength caused by those disturbances, the WiZ lights can determine if there is an object moving in the room. With this feature in place, SpaceSense can turn lighting on when people enter, and off when motion is no longer detected.\n\nPrivacy and security are top of mind in the WiZ smart lighting system. SpaceSense does not detect people's exact location, nor does it recognize faces. All the detection data is processed locally without going to the Internet or cloud service. And by eliminating extra hardware, WiZ can offer improved functionality without the need for batteries or additional material waste.\n\nSpaceSense is available in all new Connected by WiZ products, including WiZ brand, Philips Smart LED and other OEM and private label brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWiZ SpaceSense\n\n<!-- image -->",

These risks are likely to intensify as the impact of climate change becomes more widely felt.\n\nIn this precarious environment, evacuation centers can be a lifeline for communities displaced when disaster strikes. Evacuation centers are often created from repurposed schools, community spaces and sports facilities, where a lack of reliable lighting can be an issue.\n\nThe Signify Foundation and Signify Philippines worked with the Asia Society for Social Improvement and Sustainable Transformation (ASSIST) to meet this need in 63 of these essential spaces. The centers were equipped with over 6,000 solar and electric floodlights, light tubes, and rechargeable light bulbs that can be used in emergencies and crises.\n\nSolar lights were chosen for this project as they are resilient, easy to use, and long lasting. These lights can also operate with zero energy costs and in areas where electrical connections are damaged or impossible, bringing light and hope to people at vulnerable times of need.\n\n'By spreading light, we will be able to create brighter lives for people, communities, and our planet. We believe that sustainable light can bring access to new opportunities, improve quality of life and health, unlock education and empowerment, and boost economic development.'\n\nYvonne Pan, Country Leader Signify Philippines\n\n<!-- image -->",

Modernizing public lighting in Huanggang Industrial Park and Jinmei Avenue in Huanggang City has helped Hubei Province reduce its carbon footprint and play its part in implementing China's greenhouse gas emissions reduction program. And beyond its environmental benefits, the upgraded lighting uses the street lighting infrastructure spanning the city to improve citizens' quality of life in multiple ways.\n\nThe city opted for Signify's BrightSites smart poles, complemented with Philips BRP and BVPseries LED streetlights and Interact connected lighting system. This combination provides high quality and energy-efficient LED lighting, plus two-way communication on a cloud-based platform. The operations team can optimize street lighting performance and accurately measure energy usage in real time, all from a remote dashboard. This helps the team detect and act on any maintenance needs, and optimize usage to bring down costs and energy-related emissions.\n\nAll this power is wrapped in sleek, compact smart poles that blend seamlessly into the surroundings, maintaining the overall integrity and aesthetic of the urban environment. The scalable, modular design allows easy configuration for changing needs.\n\nEven during daylight hours, the city's lighting infrastructure is working behind the scenes. The BrightSites smart poles integrate security cameras, environmental sensors, Wi-Fi and other devices to collect city data and enable remote management and data analysis, all within a secure network. With this intelligent system in place, city planners can make informed decisions on issues like urban planning, safety and traffic management, creating a benchmark for future smart city projects. LED screens integrated within the smart poles can be used to display information for citizens such as the date and time, weather forecast, real-time temperature, or city information.\n\n\"Signify's smart street lighting solution not only creates a safer and more comfortable environment for staff to travel and work in Huanggang Industrial Park, but also significantly reduces lighting energy consumption and operating costs. It has laid a solid foundation for the digital transformation and upgrade of the Park and the city, and definitely will help boost urban sustainable development and new smart city construction.\"\n\nShiju Xie, Director of Engineering Department, Huanggang Rong Construction Investment Co.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<\n\n\u2261\n\n>\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBrightSites smart poles - Hubei province - China\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following the start of the war in Ukraine, Signify stopped investments and paused new business in Russia. Sales in China were held back by continued COVID-19 disruptions. The supply chain environment remained difficult but thanks to the company's actions, Signify was able to secure components and deliver to customers through temporarily higher inventories. Throughout the year, Signify also managed to offset inflation by raising its sales prices.\n\nIn 2022, Signify increased its sales by 9.5% to EUR 7,514 million, a comparable sales growth of 1.2%, amid a challenging external environment. The Adjusted EBITA margin declined by 150 basis points to 10.1%, while net income increased from EUR 407 million in 2021 to EUR 532 million in 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities was EUR 376 million and free cash flow was EUR 445 million.\n\nThe sales increase of 9.5% year on year includes a positive currency effect of 6.0%, driven by the appreciation of the USD, and a positive impact of 2.4% from the consolidation of Fluence and Pierlite. Comparable sales growth was 1.2%, driven by strong traction in the professional segment, partly offset by COVID-related disruptions in China and softness in the consumer segment. LED-based sales were 83% of Signify's total sales (2021: 83%).\n\nThe gross margin increased from EUR 2,671 million to EUR 2,732 million. The Adjusted gross margin increased from EUR 2,702 million to EUR 2,806 million. As a percentage of sales, the Adjusted gross margin decreased by 210 basis points to 37.3%, mainly impacted by an adverse currency impact as price increases largely offset input and energy cost inflation.\n\nIndirect costs increased by EUR 54 million to EUR 2,222 million. Adjusted indirect costs increased by EUR 139 million to EUR 2,171 million. As a percentage of sales, Adjusted indirect costs decreased by 70 basis points to 28.9%, mainly driven by indirect cost savings.\n\nEBITA increased by EUR 208 million to EUR 844 million, benefiting from a gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Adjusted EBITA declined by EUR 33 million to EUR 762 million, as it excludes the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets and other adjusted items, such as restructuring expenses and acquisitionrelated charges. The Adjusted EBITA margin declined by 150 basis points to 10.1%, mainly due to an adverse currency impact and fixed cost under-absorption.\n\nIncome from operations increased from EUR 514 million to EUR 718 million in 2022. This included EUR 64 million of restructuring expenses, EUR 27 million of acquisitionrelated charges (mainly related to the acquisitions of Fluence and Pierlite), and a net benefit of EUR 173 million from incidental items. These incidental items are nonrecurring items in nature and are related to, among other items, impairment and other non-cash charges related to operations in Russia and Ukraine, gains on the disposal of\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase was mainly driven by the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets, partly offset by a higher income tax expense, due to higher taxable income, and higher net financial expenses.\n\nCompared with December 2021, working capital increased by EUR 314 million to EUR 564 million. This increase was mostly driven by lower payables, as payments for the 2021 inventory build-up were settled. Lower payables were partly offset by lower receivables and lower inventories. As a percentage of last twelve-month sales, working capital increased by 390 basis points to 7.5%. Including last twelve-month sales pro forma for Fluence and Pierlite, working capital increased by 380 basis points to 7.4%.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased to EUR 376 million, mainly impacted by higher working capital. Net capital expenditures increased to a positive EUR 69 million, mainly due to proceeds from the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. This resulted in a free cash flow of EUR 445 million or 5.9% of sales.\n\nShareholders' equity increased to EUR 2,920 million, reflecting the net income and currency translation results, offset by the dividend payment and purchases of treasury shares.\n\nNet debt was EUR 1,356 million at year-end 2022, an increase of EUR 200 million compared with year-end 2021. The increase in net debt was mainly related to a EUR 174 million lower cash position. The cash position was mainly impacted by the acquisitions of Fluence and Pierlite, and the dividend payment, partly offset by free cash flow, which included cash proceeds from the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Gross debt remained relatively stable year on year.\n\nAt year-end 2022, Signify had a postemployment liability of EUR 327 million, compared with EUR 363 million at the end of 2021. The reduction is mostly related to benefit payments.\n\n## 4.1.2 Performance by Division\n\n## Performance Digital Solutions\n\n## About Digital Solutions\n\nSignify is the world leader in the professional lighting market for products such as LED and systems and services, with strong positions across key geographies.

        "page_content": "## Market developments\n\nTraditional LED lamps are continuing to be replaced by higher quality, connected and more sustainable LED lamps, such as the Philips Ultra Efficient LED bulb, functional LED luminaires and connected solutions, as anticipated in the company's strategy. This trend is driven by an increasingly compelling proposition of both integrated LED luminaires and connected solutions in particular, while the replacement need of lamp sockets reduces due to the longer lifetime of LEDs. In addition, consumers and professional customers pay attention to the energy efficiency of lighting products in their purchase decision.\n\nDespite the slowdown of the consumer market in 2022, as demand was impacted by the inflationary environment, the company expects these long-term trends to continue for the foreseeable future. This provides a solid growth path with the ambition to drive market share gains, raising the energy efficiency bar through innovation and leadership in functional luminaires and connected lighting.\n\nWhile Signify expects that the LED lamps market will decline in the next few years, the company is well-positioned to continue to grow market share in this market, building on its strong position in lighting distribution. The decline in the LED lamps market is expected to be replaced by integrated LED luminaires and connected lighting, which are both expected to grow. Legislation, banning conventional technologies, is expected to further boost LED adoption.\n\nThe LED electronics market is expected to grow, particularly driven by the shift to connected lighting and the LEDification of (industrial) specialty segments.\n\nThe consumer connected system markets are expected to continue to grow on the back of the increasing global penetration of the smart home.\n\n## 2022 Business highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Introduced new Ultra Efficient A-Class products: extending the Ultra Efficiency family with TLED, a downlight and outdoor luminaires with wall and pedestals. The Ultra Efficient A-Class range generates significant incremental energy savings versus regular LED.\n- \u00b7 Expanded the Philips Hue portfolio with new products and features : launching among others the Philips Hue Perifo track lighting, the Philips Hue Festavia string lights, the Philips Hue Signe in oak with unique wakeup scenes, the Philips Hue Tap dial switch and the PC lightstrip. New effects and a Demo mode have been added to the Philips Hue app, and Philips Hue teamed up with CORSAIR in order to give an immersive gaming experience.\n- \u00b7 Offered a new way of automating WiZ lights: SpaceSense is a new way to automate WiZ lights using Wi-Fi sensing technology. It uses Wi-Fi signals that are already present in a room to detect motion. No need for dedicated sensors and batteries.\n- \u00b7 Signify won the prestigious Gold IDEA 2022 design award: Our sustainable 3D-printed Coastal Breeze pendant lamp won the prestigious Gold IDEA 2022 design award and received an honorable mention in Fast Company's Innovation by Design Awards.\n\nThe collection is 3D printed using discarded fishing nets for cleaner oceans and a low carbon footprint.\n\n## 2022 Financial performance\n\nSales increased by 0.7% to EUR 2,469 million, benefiting from a positive currency effect of 4.4%. Comparable sales declined by 3.8%, due to lower consumer sales and a Chinese market that was impacted by COVID-related disruptions.\n\nIncome from operations decreased to EUR 265 million. Restructuring costs were EUR 11 million and incidental items were EUR 14 million. Excluding these items, Adjusted EBITA was EUR 297 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 180 basis points to 12.0%, mainly due to a negative impact from currency, lower volumes and an adverse sales mix. Free cash flow decreased to EUR 170 million.\n\n## 2023 and beyond\n\nThe Digital Products division targets market share growth in LED lamps through differentiation with a multi-brand offer of Abrands, B-brands and Private Label sales.\n\nThe division also plans to grow sales of LED luminaires by innovating and expanding its product portfolio and by leveraging its LED R&D and distribution strength.\n\nIt aims to further accelerate growth in its Consumer Connected business with a twosystem offering of Philips Hue and WiZ, and by continuing to innovate in relevant consumer benefits, such as ambiance, well-being and security.\n\nDigital Products will drive growth in LED electronics through the transition to smart lighting, leveraging its innovation leadership in connected components and through dedicated offers for specialty segments.\n\nAt the same time, the division aims to improve total profitability and its cash profile by continuing to increase insourcing to Klite, the China-based manufacturing company in which Signify acquired a 51% stake in 2019.\n\n## Performance Conventional Products\n\n## About Conventional Products\n\nSignify is the global market leader in the conventional lighting business. Conventional Products comprises the company's conventional lamps and lamp electronics businesses. It produces and sells lamps, based on a wide variety of non-LED based technologies. This includes HID, TL, compact fluorescent, halogen, incandescent, as well as lamp electronics for conventional lamps (electronic ballasts and drivers) and specialty lighting. Conventional lamps are used in a wide variety of residential and professional applications and are bought by consumers, electrical installers and professional endusers through a wide range of channels. Lamp electronics are mainly sold to luminaire manufacturers directly and as replacement products to electrical wholesalers. Finally, Conventional Products sells digital projection lamps and drivers to the OEM market and the replacement market.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This position supports the company's drive to lead the transition to connected LED products. The division continues to proactively manage its manufacturing footprint and reduce operational costs to optimize free cash flow.\n\n## Market developments\n\nThe conventional lamps market is expected to continue to decline in the coming years due to the ongoing adoption of LED lighting technologies and regulatory changes. In 2022, higher energy prices caused an accelerated conversion of customers, from conventional to LED lighting.\n\n## 2022 Business highlights\n\nSignify estimates that the conventional lighting market declined at a faster pace than its Conventional Products division in 2022 and thus the business continued to gain market share for the 6 th consecutive year.\n\n## 2022 Financial performance\n\nSales decreased by 7.9% to EUR 793 million and included a positive currency effect of 4.6%. Comparable sales declined by 12.6%, as lower volumes were partly offset by price increases.\n\nIncome from operations declined to EUR 60 million. Restructuring costs were EUR 34 million and incidental items were EUR 22 million. The incidental items included environmental provisions for inactive sites and legal charges. Excluding these impacts, the Adjusted EBITA margin decreased to 14.6%, as an adverse currency impact, lower fixed cost coverage and higher input costs were not fully offset by price increases and indirect cost savings.\n\n## 2023 and beyond\n\nConventional Products will intensify its focus on optimizing market share, profit and cash, in line with its 'last company standing' strategy. It will do so by leveraging its scale, global footprint and lean manufacturing capabilities, while still responding to the remaining customer demand for conventional products.\n\n## Performance Other\n\n\"Other\" represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes costs related both to central R&D activities to drive innovation, and to Group enabling functions. Income from operations was EUR 137 million and EBITA was EUR 138 million. This includes restructuring costs of EUR 4 million and a net benefit of EUR 217 million from incidentals, which was mostly related to the gain on the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets. Adjusted EBITA was EUR (75) million, compared with EUR (102) million in 2021.\n\n## 4.1.3 P erformance by geographic cluster\n\nIn 2022, the professional segment recovered across most markets despite a slowdown in the fourth quarter, while demand in the consumer segment softened.\n\nIn Americas, sales grew by 15.4% to EUR 2,978 million and included a strong impact from the appreciation of the USD. Comparable sales grew by 3.2%, with a solid contribution from Cooper Lighting.\n\nIn the Rest of the world, sales grew by 6.5% to EUR 1,709 million. Sales included a positive currency effect and a positive impact from the acquisition of Pierlite. Comparable sales declined by 1.5%, mainly due to China, the Middle East and South Korea.\n\nGlobal businesses grew by 9.9% to EUR 597 million. Sales growth included a positive impact from the acquisition of Fluence and a positive currency effect. Comparable sales declined by 9.2%, mainly due to Klite, which was impacted by COVID-related disruptions in China.\n\nIn Europe sales grew by 4.7% to EUR 2,230 million. Comparable sales grew by 3.9%. All European markets grew, except Eastern Europe, which was impacted by the war in Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\n\n## Sales by geography in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated\n\n|                      | 2021   | 2022   | Change   | CSG     |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Europe               | 2,130  | 2,230  | 4.7%     | 3.9%    |\n| Americas             | 2,581  | 2,978  | 15.4%    | 3.2%    |\n| Rest of the world  1 | 1,606  | 1,709  | 6.5%     | (1.5) % |\n| Global businesses  2 | 543    | 597    | 9.9%     | (9.2) % |\n| Total                | 6,860  | 7,514  | 9.5%     | 1.2%    |\n\n- 1 Rest of the World includes Pierlite since April 29, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The remainder of the net income, after reservations made with the approval of the Supervisory Board, shall be available for distribution to holders of ordinary shares subject to shareholder approval after yearend. As of December 31, 2022, the issued share capital consists only of ordinary shares; no preference shares have been issued. Under Article 10 of the Articles of Association of Signify N.V., the Board of Management can determine what portion of the net income shall be retained by way of reserve, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\nSignify proposes to declare a cash dividend of EUR 1.50 per share for 2022. The dividend proposal will be subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) to be held on May 16, 2023.\n\nThe balance sheet presented in this report, as part of the company financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2022, is before appropriation of the result for the financial year 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.4 Outlook\n\nSignify continues to aim for growth, both organic and through selected acquisitions.\n\nGiven the volatility of the current macro environment, Signify does not provide a comparable sales growth guidance for 2023. The company will focus its efforts on improving its Adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow.\n\nSignify expects for 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 An Adjusted EBITA margin in the range of 10.5-11.5%.\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow between 6-8% of sales.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The war in Ukraine, geopolitical tensions, the continued COVID-related disruptions, rising energy prices and inflation all added to a difficult market and geopolitical environment. The impact was felt by our customers and our people, and impacted business performance. At the same time, the rising energy prices added to a broad consensus on an urgent need to reducing energy use. This revalidated the company's sustainability agenda, which has been an inherent part of Signify's strategy for many years.\n\nThe business challenges that we faced in 2022 were discussed in a transparent manner. Throughout the year there has been an open dialogue between management and the Supervisory Board on how to address these challenges and multiple other matters that are important for the company, its business and its stakeholders.\n\nAs a Supervisory Board, we have been actively involved in refining the strategic direction of Signify throughout 2022. We have observed great agility in how the company addressed the market and geopolitical challenges in 2022, and has been preparing for the period ahead.\n\nWe look back on a year with substantial challenges that were well managed, and look ahead with confidence.\n\n## Arthur van der Poel\n\nChair of the Supervisory Board\n\n## 8.1 Introduction\n\nThis report provides information on how the Supervisory Board and its committees fulfilled their duties in 2022.\n\nWe welcomed Bram Schot, who was appointed as a member of our Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in May 2022. At the same time, Eelco Blok stepped down from our Board at the end of his four-year term. The Supervisory Board currently consists of six independent members. In December, we proposed the appointment of Sophie Bechu as a Supervisory Board member, which will be on the agenda of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board had four committees that cover key areas in greater detail: an Audit Committee, a Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, a Remuneration Committee, and a Digital Committee. The charters of each of the committees are published on the company's website.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board was pleased that in 2022, it could organize most of its meetings in person again, after having had two years of meetings primarily via video conference due to COVID-19.\n\nOn average, the attendance rate of the Supervisory Board meetings was 98%. The attendance record matrix in this chapter 8.2 gives details for both the Supervisory Board and committee meetings.\n\nEach of the Supervisory Board committees regularly convened and reported back on their activities to the full Supervisory Board. In addition, the Chair of the Supervisory Board and the CEO are in regular contact on a variety of matters. Our members also individually interacted with members of the Board of Management and with senior management outside the formal Supervisory Board meetings. From time to time, Supervisory Board members wanted to be informed on, or discuss, a specific topic. This was then followed-up by a member of the Board of Management or senior management.\n\nThere were no apparent conflicts of interest of material significance in 2022, which would have called for one of the members not to participate in the decision-making.\n\n## Supervisory Board and Committee Attendance Record\n\n|                      | Supervisory  Board in person  meetings   | Supervisory  Board calls   | Audit  Committee   | Nomination  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Digital  Committee   |\n|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n| TOTAL MEETINGS       | 6                                        | 2                          | 6                  | 6                       | 4                         | 4                    |\n| Arthur van der Poel  | 6 / 6                                    | 2 / 2                      |                    | 6 / 6                   | 4 / 4                     |                      |\n| Gerard Van de Aast \u00b9 | 6 / 6                                    | 2 / 2                      | 6 / 6              |                         | 4 / 4                     |                      |\n| Eelco Blok \u00b2         | 1 / 2                                    | 2 / 2                      | 3 / 3              |                         |                           | 1 / 1                |\n| Pamela Knapp         | 6 / 6                                    | 2 / 2                      | 6 / 6              |                         | 2 / 4                     |                      |\n| Rita Lane            | 6 / 6                                    | 2 / 2                      |                    | 6 / 6                   |                           | 4 / 4                |\n| Frank Lubnau         | 6 / 6                                    | 2 / 2                      |                    | 6 / 6                   |                           | 4 / 4                |\n| Bram Schot \u00b3         | 6 / 6                                    | 2 / 2                      | 2 / 3              |                         |                           | 1 / 3                |\n| Total attendance \u2074   | 97%                                      | 100%                       | 94%                | 100%                    | 83%                       | 83%                  |\n\n- 1 Mr. Van de Aast attended one of the in person meetings via video conference.\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board discussed a wide range of topics throughout the year. Key topics and activities included the following:\n\n## \u00b7 Strategy Review\n\nIn September 2022, we had our annual Strategy Review meeting, dedicated to discussing the company's strategy towards sustainable long-term value creation. As part of the session, we discussed macroenvironment trends and changes, the impact on the lighting market forecast and competitive trends. We looked at the company's financial and sustainability performance, customer experience, and performance on our 2022 strategic initiatives. We discussed the strategic implications of the current macroenvironment, enterprise risks, and how we will address these as part of the overall\n\ncompany's 5 Frontiers strategy and strategic initiatives for 2023.\n\nAs part of the Strategy Review in September, we also had three strategic deep dives on the impact of geopolitical conditions on the supply chain, human capital implications of digital transformation and an assessment of the growth initiatives and tech bets portfolio performance. Each of these deep dives was prepared with guidance and input of a Supervisory Board member, benefiting from their knowledge and experience in the respective domains.\n\nThe Strategy Review was followed by a strategic plan discussion in December in which management presented the 2023-2025 strategic plan, including financial objectives. We also discussed and approved the company's financial targets\n\nfor 2023 within the context of its 2023 operating plan.\n\nIn addition to these meetings dedicated to the company's strategy, management updated us on a quarterly basis on the progress made on the company's strategic initiatives for 2022. Throughout the year, we also discussed the market trends, risks and opportunities as well as the strategy, as part of the market and division updates.\n\nAs a follow-up to last year's Supervisory Board performance evaluation, we introduced quarterly discussions on trends and developments in the competitive landscape and deep dives on the company's competitors. We found these discussions very useful and will continue having these in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "A discussion of the company's digital strategy is included under the activities of the Supervisory Board Digital Committee below.\n\nBoth on a quarterly basis and as part of the division and market updates, we discussed pending and potential acquisitions and divestments contributing to the company's strategy execution. We also addressed the integration of recent acquisitions, including Fluence and Pierlite.\n\nWe have reviewed, challenged, and advised the Board of Management on the company's implementation of its strategic plan and strategic priorities throughout the year.\n\n## \u00b7 Culture\n\nAs the Supervisory Board, we have found the company's culture strong, with great importance being attached to diversity, equity & inclusion.\n\nAs part of our standing meeting agenda, we had our annual discussion dedicated to the company's culture. In this discussion, we review the alignment of the company's purpose, its values, sustainability and diversity, equity & inclusion with how it is embedded and fostered in the company's strategy and organization. This year, we focused on diversity, equity & inclusion and performance mindset.\n\n## \u00b7 Market and geopolitical environment & business performance\n\nThe year 2022 brought multiple market disruptions and geopolitical tensions, with impact for our customers, our people, our business and society at large. As a Supervisory Board we closely monitored these developments, how these impacted the company (both risks and opportunities), and how we addressed these.\n\nEach quarter, we discussed the company's business performance in detail. These discussions included updates on the company's financial performance on key financial metrics and factors impacting performance and forecasts, both on a global and on a division and market basis.\n\nAmong the factors impacting performance were the increased energy prices and inflation, affecting both the company's costs and customer demand. This effect was particularly felt by the company's conventional business as the energy prices further incentivized customers to move to LED and simultaneously product manufacturing prices increased. We discussed strategic initiatives and focused on managing decline and profitability in this business.\n\nAlso in 2022, we continued to review the impact of COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions to our people and operations. Management updated us on developments on a quarterly basis. This was in addition to the annual review of the company's footprint. We also discussed standardization initiatives, the use of 3D printing and component redesign,\n\nenhancing supply chain resilience and agility, and reducing potential waste.\n\n## \u00b7 Sustainability\n\nSustainability is an inherent part of the company's 5 Frontiers strategy. In pursuance thereof, the company developed a five-year sustainability program: Brighter Lives, Better World 2025. Throughout the year, we were updated on the company's progress on this program, and the company's strategic initiatives for 2022 to drive growth for sustainability.\n\nWe also had a dedicated sustainability update, as part of which we reviewed the 2022 materiality assessment that is discussed in more detail in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sub-section 16.1.1, Definition of Signify's strategic focus. The Supervisory Board also discussed with management the company's ESG reporting, both under the company's sustainability program and under the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## \u00b7 Capital allocation, financial reporting and investor relations\n\nWe reviewed the capital allocation policy of the company. In this context we also discussed expectations related to cash generation, dividend distributions, investments in innovation and M&A, share repurchases to cover obligations arising from Signify's long-term incentive and other employee share plans, debt profile as well as credit ratings.\n\nWe discussed the quarterly results and the (semi-) annual financial statements for 2022, including related reports from the internal and external auditors and non-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfinancial information, and related press releases.\n\nAfter the publication of each quarterly results, the Investor Relations department updated us on the market reaction and analyst views. From time to time throughout the year, the Investor Relations department updated us on feedback from and interactions with investors and analysts, developments in the company's share price and analyst recommendations, as well as updates in the shareholder base.\n\n## \u00b7 On-site visits and innovation\n\nSince our acquisition of Cooper Lighting in 2020, the US market has become increasingly important for Signify. Whereas the Supervisory Board had initially planned to visit Cooper Lighting in the fall of 2020, COVID-19 made such a visit impossible in 2020 and in 2021. In September 2022, the Supervisory Board made a two-day visit to the company's North American teams in the company's offices in Bridgewater (NJ) and Peachtree City (GA). Presentations were given on various topics, including the company's North America performance, strategy, customers, culture and talent. In a tour, the US product development teams presented products and innovations. The Supervisory Board also participated in a round table and dinner with distributors, contractors and specifiers, and had multiple interactions with the US teams.\n\nIn October, the Supervisory Board visited a horticultural grower in the Netherlands, where Signify horticulture lamps are installed, and had discussions about the customer's business and experiences as well as recent trends in the industry.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the High Tech Campus in Eindhoven, the company's innovation department gave demonstrations of recent and future technologies being developed. Via video conference consoles, members of the innovation teams from other regions in the world also participated in these demonstrations.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk management and internal controls We discussed the company's risk management and internal controls, including any significant changes and improvements thereto.\n\nAs part of the annual Strategy Review session in September, we discussed the key enterprise risks identified, and how the company addresses these. Via the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board also received a quarterly update of the enterprise risk management selfassessment on key risks identified.\n\nThe Supervisory Board had a dedicated session on the cybersecurity risk assessment together with the strategy and initiatives to address these risks. This was complemented by a quarterly cyber security update.\n\nFor more information on the company's key risks, risk management and the company's business control framework, see chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management.\n\n## \u00b7 Talent management\n\nThe company's Human Resources department presented its annual update on\n\ntalent management, succession planning of employees who are in key positions, organizational design, employee Net Promoter Score (NPS), gender and age diversity and focus areas for the coming period. As one of the strategic deep dives of the September Strategy Review, we addressed the human resources implications of the digital transformation of the company.\n\n8.3\n\n## Key activities of the Supervisory Board committees in 2022\n\n## 8.3.1 Audit Committee\n\nOur Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for, amongs other matters, the quality and integrity of the company's financial statements, the internal business controls and risk management systems, the internal and external audit as well as monitoring compliance.\n\nPamela Knapp is the Chair of the Audit Committee. Eelco Blok was a member of this committee until he stepped down from our Supervisory Board in May 2022. Bram Schot succeeded him as a member of the committee as of that time. Gerard van de\n\nAast has been a member of the Audit Committee throughout the year.\n\nThe Audit Committee met six times in 2022, upon the conclusion of each quarter, in December (hard close) and in a combined meeting of the Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee in February to review and approve the company's annual report. The committee reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after every meeting. The CEO, CFO, Group Controller, Chief Accountant, Head of Internal Audit, Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary and external auditor (Ernst & Young Accountants LLP) generally attend Audit Committee meetings. At the end of each meeting, the committee holds a private session separately with the external auditor, without members of management being present. The Head of Internal Audit is invited to this private session from time to time. The committee Chair also has regular contact with the CFO, the Head of Internal Audit and the external auditor outside of committee meetings.\n\nAs part of its standing agenda, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed:\n\n- \u00b7 The company's financial statements and related press releases;\n- \u00b7 Developments in larger legal cases together with any related provisions as well as material investigations;\n- \u00b7 Internal audits performed;\n- \u00b7 The annual audit plan and programs for each quarter, the internal audit charter as well as the functioning and effectiveness of the internal audit function. The committee approved the internal audit plan and internal audit charter;\n- \u00b7 The company's annual integrity report over the past year, and key observations. As\n\npart hereof, attention was paid to fraudrelated risks;\n\n- \u00b7 The enterprise risk management selfassessments, together with the risk management framework and external risk trend;\n- \u00b7 The company's business controls and risk management, and any significant changes and improvements thereto, and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee also dedicated time to the following matters:\n\n## \u00b7 Sustainability reporting\n\nThe committee discussed reporting under the company's Brighter Lives Better World 2025 program and under the EU taxonomy, and adaptations to the company's reporting system and processes to adequately cover these in its 2022 reporting and beyond. For more information, see chapter 16, Sustainability statements, section 16.5, Brighter Lives.\n\n## \u00b7 Deep dives on selected topics\n\nDeep dives on a selection of topics were presented by management and discussed with the Audit Committee, including on master data management, cash and inventory.\n\n- \u00b7 Proposal external auditor 2023-2025 In 2016, Ernst & Young Accountants LLP was appointed as the company's external auditor for a period of four years, followed by a re-appointment for the period 2020-2022. In 2022, the committee and management conducted an assessment of the performance of the external auditor. Following that assessment, the committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "recommended and the Supervisory Board decided to propose the re-appointment of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP for another period, this time of three years (2023-2025). This proposed reappointment will be on the agenda of the upcoming 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. More information will be included in the agenda and explanatory notes thereto.\n\n## \u00b7 Interaction with external auditor and audit results reports\n\nThe reporting from the company's external auditor Ernst & Young Accountants LLP relates to the audit plan and the audit results reports, which are shared with management and the Audit Committee. In the reports, the external auditor highlights developments that are relevant for their key audit matters, and provides details on their audit approach, procedures and observations in relation thereto. In the reports, the external auditor also highlights other areas, developments or audit procedures performed, and their observations and considerations on management judgement and estimates applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\n\nIn the Audit Committee meetings, the external auditor discussed their reports with management and the committee. The discussions with the external auditors also covered matters related to accounting policies, financial risks, compliance with accounting standards and compliance with (financial) legal requirements. Other areas of the Audit Committee review included the proposed external audit scope, approach, fees and the independence of the external\n\nauditor. The committee reviewed the professional fitness and good standing of the external auditor and its engagement partners. For information on the fees of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP, refer to chapter 15, Signify N.V. financial statements, note B, Audit fees.\n\nThe audit by the external auditor, including a discussion of the key audit matters, is discussed in the auditor's report which is included in chapter 17, Combined independent auditor's report.\n\n## 8.3.2 Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee assists the Supervisory Board by preparing the selection criteria and appointment procedure for members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, periodically assessing the succession planning for the individual members of these boards and arranging interviews of potential candidates. The committee also supervises the policy on the selection and appointment of certain other key management positions. The committee is charged with reviewing the company's corporate governance (for more information on corporate governance refer to chapter 10, Corporate governance). The performance evaluation of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board is led by the committee.\n\nArthur van der Poel (Chair), Rita Lane and Frank Lubnau are the members of this committee.\n\nThe committee met six times in 2022 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The CEO and Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary generally attend the committee's meetings. The committee Chair has regular contact with the CEO and the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary. Various topics are often prepared among the committee members ahead of a committee meeting, resulting in efficient decision-making during the meetings.\n\nAs part of its standing agenda, the committee discussed changes in key personnel positions, succession planning and the functioning of key personnel as well as the Supervisory Board's performance evaluation procedures. In addition, the committee discussed developments in the Dutch corporate governance landscape and the company's corporate governance structure. It also discussed the committee's own charter.\n\nIn 2022, the committee specifically dedicated time to the following matters:\n\n## \u00b7 Composition Board of Management\n\n- Following a review and assessment by the committee, the Supervisory Board proposed to expand the Board of Management with the appointment of the company's Digital Solutions division leader, Harshavardhan (Harsh) Chitale. The Supervisory Board recommends this internal promotion to the Board of Management in view of the track record of Harsh Chitale in many different roles within the company, notably as leader of the company's largest division, and expectation that his experience and competencies will further strengthen the Board of Management in refining our strategy and\n\ndriving its execution. This proposed appointment will be on the agenda of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) to be held on May 16, 2023.\n\n## \u00b7 Composition Supervisory Board and onboarding\n\nFollowing the selection process led by the committee, Bram Schot was appointed as Supervisory Board member in May 2022. He followed a tailor-made immersion program to get to know the company's industry, business, strategy and management as well as our cyber security training for Supervisory Board members.\n\nIn 2022, the committee prepared and led an assessment and selection process that resulted in the proposal by the Supervisory Board to expand the Supervisory Board by the appointment Sophie Bechu at the AGM to be held on May 16, 2023. The Supervisory Board recommends the appointment of Sophie Bechu in view of her wealth of experience in operations and a strong connection to the US market, which since our acquisition of Cooper Lighting in 2020 has become increasingly important for the company. In each selection process, the committee takes account of the desired board profile, including its diversity policy and expertise and experience as well as the desired board size.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our boards' profile and the Supervisory Board skills and expertise matrix reflect the areas that the committee and Supervisory Board regard to be most relevant to address the transition in the lighting industry and the execution of the company's 5 Frontiers strategy.\n\nIn 2022, the committee reviewed the matrix categories. In view of the continued importance of the supply chain, the committee recommended and the Supervisory Board resolved to add \"Operations/supply chain\" as a category to the matrix. The biographies of the Supervisory Board members published on the company's website complement the information included in the matrix.\n\nThe committee also reviewed the Boards profile, and upon the committee's recommendation the Supervisory Board updated our diversity objectives that are part thereof. For the Supervisory Board members, and in line with the Dutch law requirement as of 2022, we aim that at least one-third are men and at least onethird are women.

Both of our Boards meet these objectives. For more details on the profile, including the diversity of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, please refer to chapter 10, Corporate governance. For more information on diversity & inclusion in the company, please refer to chapter 16, Sustainability statements, section 16.3, Brighter Lives.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board was also addressed in the annual performance evaluation (see below). The Supervisory Board observed that a board of about seven members is a good size for the company, whereby it was felt that it should add a member with US market expertise, which is being addressed by proposing Sophie Bechu to be appointed to the board. The Supervisory Board found that it has the right diversity mix.\n\nThe committee will continue to periodically assess its size and composition, including the desired diversity, and initiate searches where indicated.\n\n## \u00b7 ESG committee\n\nWe noted the suggestion from some stakeholders to companies in general to consider establishing an ESG committee from among their supervisory boards to support progress on sustainability. This topic was also addressed in our annual performance evaluation (see below). Sustainability has been an integral part of Signify's strategy for many years. The company also publishes extensive\n\nsustainability statements. The full Supervisory Board is and will continue to be engaged in the strategy, including sustainability. We decided that the review of the sustainability reporting resides best in the Audit Committee. In view of this, we see no need to establish an ESG committee from among the Supervisory Board.\n\n## 8.3.3 Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, amongs other matters, reviewing and preparing remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board, remuneration proposals for individual members of the Board of Management and other key management positions, as well as proposals for targets relevant to the variable compensation of members of the Board of Management and the review of their performance.\n\nGerard van de Aast (Chair), Pamela Knapp and Arthur van der Poel are the members of this committee. Currently, no member of the Remuneration Committee is a member of the executive management board of another listed company.\n\nIn performing its duties and responsibilities, the Remuneration Committee is assisted by an external consultant and an in-house remuneration expert.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee met four times in 2022 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The CEO, the Chief HR Officer, the Head of Rewards and the Chief Legal Officer/General\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following those consultations, the committee prepared decisions and advised the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs part of the standing agenda, the Remuneration Committee discussed, among other matters, the interim and final performance results on variable remuneration components for the previous periods, target setting for variable remuneration for the upcoming periods, base salary levels for the Board of Management, scenario analyses, and disclosure in the remuneration report.\n\nNo changes were proposed to the remuneration policy for the Board of Management nor for the Supervisory Board in 2022. The committee reflected on the AGM advisory vote on the 2021 remuneration report, and disclosure in the remuneration report going forward. The committee Chair engaged with key stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, to obtain feedback on executive remuneration in general, insights on the AGM advisory vote and attention points for the 2022 remuneration report. This feedback was shared with the committee and the Supervisory Board. In the next remuneration policy review, the feedback received from shareholders will be addressed.\n\nAlso refer to chapter 9, Remuneration report, for further information on the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and their implementation in\n\n2022 as well as reflections on the 2022 AGM advisory vote.\n\n## 8.3.4 Digital Committee\n\nThe Digital Committee assists the Supervisory Board by, amongst other matters, reviewing the company's digital strategy and roadmap, digital objectives and performance and the governance for deciding on digital prioritization.\n\nFrank Lubnau is the Chair of the Digital Committee. Eelco Blok was a member of this committee until he stepped down from our Supervisory Board in May 2022. Bram Schot succeeded him as a member of the committee as of that time. Rita Lane has been a member of the Digital Committee throughout the year.\n\nThe Digital Committee met four times in 2022 and reported its findings to the full Supervisory Board after each meeting. The committee also had additional working sessions and deep dives discussing particular topics and projects. The CFO, the Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDIO) and the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary generally attend the committee meetings. The committee Chair has regular contact with the CFO and the CDIO.\n\nThe company's digital roadmap has three focus areas: digitalizing customer interfaces, digitalizing processes and digitalizing offers. In 2022, management discussed with the committee how the company further strengthened its operations, further improved its digital governance, developed key capabilities to accelerate digitalization\n\nand hired additional digital talent. The committee discussed in more detail some key projects through which the company executes its digital strategy. As part of the standing agenda, the committee reviewed the strategic digital priorities for the year, and progress on key digital projects, initiatives and enablers.\n\n## 8.4 Performance evaluation\n\nWe evaluated the performance of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2022.\n\nThe Board of Management evaluated their team and personal targets performance, and shared their views with the Chair and Chair of the Remuneration Committee, which were discussed in the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe objective of our Supervisory Board selfevaluation is to gain better insight into the functioning of the Supervisory Board, to identify strengths that we want to keep and to identify matters that the Supervisory Board or the company can improve. Building on feedback provided in 2021, together with relevant developments in 2022, we prepared an updated questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed, among other matters, the focus of discussions during our meetings, the depth and quality of discussions on key topics, the functioning of the committees, the relationship between the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, the views on the Supervisory Board as a team and\n\nhow it conducted itself, learnings from 2022, as well as the desired focus in the future.\n\nThe questionnaire was completed by members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management as well as the Chief Legal Officer/General Secretary to the boards. Following an evaluation of the questionnaire by the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, observations were discussed in a plenary session with the Supervisory Board only. Hereafter, one-on-one discussions took place between the Chair and the individual Supervisory Board members, and with the Vice-Chair on the functioning of the Chair. The responses to the questionnaire were shared with all respondents together with a proposal for follow-ups.\n\nThe self-evaluation has once again provided valuable insights on how the Supervisory Board operates as a team and where the Supervisory Board and the company can improve. In 2022, the Supervisory Board experienced that the engagement among the board is high and that we operated as a good, critical and constructive team. The evaluation showed consensus on the strategy process being improved by the involvement of Supervisory Board members in the preparation of deep dives that were part of the September Strategy Review. The evaluation also brought learnings on and improvements in the way we operate, such as how we can best track the execution of the strategy at the Supervisory Board level. On sustainability, we agreed that the Supervisory Board oversight on sustainability strategy remains a topic for the full Supervisory Board, whereas sustainability reporting best resides with the Audit Committee. Especially in view\n\n<!-- image -->",

This report includes a detailed explanation of the current remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. The effectuation of these policies in 2022 is discussed in parts 9.2 and 9.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nOver the course of 2022 we continued our engagement with key stakeholders, such as shareholders, shareholder representative groups and the Dutch Central Works Council, to understand their views on remuneration in general and to solicit feedback on the remuneration report of Signify. These interactions were very productive, leading to a good dialogue and valuable feedback, particularly on the strong link that exists between Signify's ESG metrics and remuneration for the Board of Management via the company's long-term incentive plan.\n\n## Signify's performance in 2022\n\nA year that was expected to result in the stabilization of the world post COVID and a return to growth for Signify, was not what ultimately transpired. The dual specter of war and inflation completely changed the dynamic of 2022 and ultimately how Signify had to adapt and manage these dual crises. It was therefore very much a year of adaptation for the company.\n\nThe Chinese market was impacted by COVID-related disruptions and Europe was impacted by the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy challenges. Inflation, at a level not seen in decades, impacted the global environment. As a result, the traction that was expected to take hold early in 2022 did not materialize. For Signify, margins and cash were impacted by inflation and supply chain disruptions. In addition, a decline in the consumer market and an adverse currency impact was experienced. As a result of these dynamics, the financial performance was negatively impacted.\n\nStrategically the company continued to stay the course and drive toward a differentiated position in the market. The relevance of Signify products and solutions was further heightened in 2022, as energy efficiency became even more urgent. This strengthened the competitive position as the company executed on the strategic priorities. New innovations and sustainable lighting solutions continued to be brought to customers. The Supervisory Board is pleased that the connected lighting business and growth platforms grew to reach almost EUR 2 billion of sales.\n\nSignify continues to lead the way in sustainability with the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program and has made significant progress toward the 2025 goals.  The ambition to reduce\n\n<!-- image -->",

Circular and Brighter lives revenues are on track to meet the ambitious five-year targets. Doubling the percentage of women in senior leadership remains on track for the five-year ambition, despite being off track for the more challenging target set for the 2022 expectation of progress to this goal.\n\nThe Ukrainian crises impacted customers and the business, but importantly also Signify employees. The Supervisory Board was very proud of how Signify team members, throughout the company, reacted in line with the company values, particularly Greater Together, to support Signify colleagues and their families. Finally, Signify products and solutions were utilized to support Ukraine, while the Signify Foundation provided humanitarian support to the country.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe 2021 remuneration report received a 70.94% advisory vote from the shareholders, at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, held on May 17, 2022. To better understand shareholder feedback and concerns that appear from the relatively large advisory vote against the remuneration report, we engaged with key shareholders during the year. We understood that the rationale behind this vote outcome was primarily related to the full vesting of long-term incentives after retirement, and the disclosure of such, which was not viewed as best practice, a desire for greater disclosure on the annual incentive, and an incorrect understanding of the salary increase provided to Board of Management members in 2021 resulting from some investors using the temporary voluntary reduction of salary taken by the Board of Management in 2020 as the base line salary.\n\nThese engagements to further understand stakeholder feedback on the Signify Remuneration Report 2021, included shareholders representing 18% of shares outstanding. In addition, engagements with other stakeholders included shareholder representative groups as well as the Dutch Central Works Council.\n\nWe experienced those conversations as very constructive and they have led to improvements in our Remuneration Report. The following key points came from those interactions:\n\n- \u00b7 Very positive feedback on the link of strategy, ESG metrics, long-term incentives and related disclosure.\n- \u00b7 Expectation that for retirees a pro-rata application of long-term incentives would apply or disclosure of treatment of long-term incentives at retirement.\n- \u00b7 Expectation of increasing disclosure, particularly on financial metrics in short-term incentives; and\n- \u00b7 Expectation that should there be any discretion used by the Supervisory Board with respect to remuneration, the rationale would be clearly detailed in the report.\n\nWith respect to the second item, the vesting of long-term incentives at retirement, this feedback will be addressed in the next Remuneration Policy review. With respect to the third and fourth items, the outcomes on both the annual incentive plan and the long-term incentive plan reflect the actual performance despite the significant challenges presented over 2022. No discretion was applied on those outcomes, nor were targets adjusted during 2022, and additional information on the annual incentive has been provided to increase disclosure.\n\nFinally, the link between the Signify strategy, ESG metrics and remuneration overall was a key component of all stakeholder conversations. Signify was identified as being a leader in its approach to sustainability, the degree of reporting on these metrics and the related link to the long-term incentive plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are pleased with this engagement with stakeholders and we use this ongoing dialogue to continue to evolve the 2022 report in direct response to this feedback. We trust that stakeholders experience these changes positively and appreciate the spirit of transparency and continuous improvement which drives them.\n\n## Gerard van de Aast\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our policy aims to stimulate sustainable short- and long-term value creation. Therefore, the performance measures used in the variable compensation components are linked to quantitative financial, non-financial and sustainability targets. The remuneration policy also serves a communication purpose as it clearly stipulates and supports a common approach to deliver on the company's strategy.\n\n## Signify's value creation model :\n\nThe value created by Signify goes beyond financial performance alone. Our approach is to optimize long-term value through financial, environmental and social resources. Our focus on environment and the societal implications of doing business is evidenced in our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program. This program links to our long-term incentive plan and ensures that the interests of the organization, society at large and our impact on the environment in which we live are key elements in how Signify delivers long-term value creation to stakeholders. Our activities and our way of doing business impact customers, employees, investors and society at large. Signify expresses these impacts in monetary terms in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, section 3.3, Our value created.\n\nThe current remuneration policy for the Board of Management a nd for the Supervisory Board was adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (AGM) in 2020. The effectuation of these policies in 2022 is discussed in parts 9.2 and 9.3 of this remuneration report.\n\nThe report included in this chapter constitutes the remuneration report within the meaning of Section 2:135b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe following principles apply for the remuneration policy of the Board of Management:\n\n- \u00b7 Signify's remuneration policy aims to attract, reward and retain qualified leaders to pursue the company's purpose and long-term strategic objectives, while taking the interest of all the company's stakeholders into account.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration levels are to be competitive and in line with the market practice of comparable companies and support a pay-for-performance philosophy with a proportion of remuneration at risk.\n- \u00b7 During the policy design and review process, stakeholder feedback and legal provisions, including the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, are taken into consideration.\n\n## Remuneration components\n\nThe compensation package for the members of the Board of Management consists of the following fixed and variable components:\n\n- \u00b7 Base salary.\n- \u00b7 Annual cash incentive.\n- \u00b7 Long-term equity-based incentive.\n- \u00b7 Pensions and other benefits.\n\nThe combination of a member's base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity-based incentive, together referred to as the 'total direct compensation', is targeted around the median level of a representative labor market peer group and benchmarked on a regular basis.\n\nThis peer group consists of 50% Dutch-headquartered cross-industry companies that are included in the AEX or AMX, and 50% European sector-specific companies.\n\nThe labor market peer group consists of the following 14 companies:\n\n## Labor Market Peer Group\n\n| Aalberts   | DSM     | Prysmian Group    |\n|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| AkzoNobel  | KPN     | Rexel             |\n| ASML       | Legrand | Rheinmetall Group |\n| BAM        | Nexans  | Siemens Gamesa    |\n| Boskalis   | OSRAM   |                   |\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the peer group on a regular basis and may adjust to ensure that the companies in the group remain relevant peers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, estimated future remuneration levels are assessed against the potential achievement of strategic\n\nobjectives. The scenarios considered achievement across all metrics at below threshold, target and maximum levels of performance and the resulting remuneration. Based on the scenario analyses performed, the Supervisory Board has concluded that the policy supports the pay-forperformance philosophy.\n\n## 9.2.2 B ase salary\n\nThe base salary compensates for the individual's experience, skills, duties, responsibilities and the contribution of the individual within Signify. The Supervisory Board determines the base salary and may adjust the base salary, for example following the results of benchmark studies and to ensure alignment between members of the Board of Management. Absent any adjustment of the base salary, it follows the (collective and merit) increase as agreed for the CLA population in the Netherlands. The Supervisory Board regularly reviews the total direct compensation (including base salaries).\n\nThe annual compensation of the members of the Board of Management was reviewed in 2022 in line with the regular remuneration review. The Remuneration Committee considered the input of the Board of Management members in setting their pay levels.\n\nFor 2022, the Supervisory Board decided to increase the base salary levels for all members of the Board of Management by 3%, in line with the budgets (collective and merit increase) allocated for the CLA population in the Netherlands.\n\n## New base salaries Board of Management in 2022 in EUR\n\n|                        | January 1, 2022 (+ 3%)   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

Variable pay is based on both financial and non-financial performance measures. In selecting performance measures, their respective weights and targets for a performance period, the following is considered:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance measures are selected based on relevance to the company's strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The target definition for these variable remuneration components includes target intervals and correlating payout schemes, being defined in incremental steps in performance and respective payout. In addition, a minimum threshold for the achievement of financial performance measures applies, below which there will be no payout. Following the end of the relevant performance period, the Supervisory Board will assess the actual performance relative to the targets set. On that basis, the Supervisory Board will, at its discretion, determine the achievement per performance measure and target.\n\n## 9.2.4 A nnual cash incentive\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are eligible for an annual cash incentive. The annual incentive is designed to reward the achievement of annual financial and operational objectives and personal performance. The purpose is to ensure alignment with the company's annual business plan setting the strategic priorities for that year, which in turn contribute to the company's long-term objectives.\n\nThe Supervisory Board can annually select two or three financial performance measures from the following list, and determine the weighting per performance measure: growth (such as comparable sales growth), profit (such as adjusted EBITA or net income), cash flow (such as average working capital or free cash flow) and investment return (such as return on capital employed).\n\nThe possibility to annually select financial performance measures from the above list gives the Supervisory Board a certain level of flexibility to ensure continuous alignment of the performance measures with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term.\n\nThe financial performance measures used in the annual incentive to track performance over 2022 were comparable sales growth (measured as a percentage of sales), Adjusted EBITA (measured as a percentage of sales) and free cash flow (measured as a percentage of sales). These measures were determined by the Supervisory Board to reflect the best alignment with the company's strategy and financial objectives for the mid-term focusing on profitable growth. The financial targets for 2022 were set within the context of the medium-term objectives of the company at the beginning of the year and did not change over the course of 2022. Payout between the financial targets is linear.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe team/individual performance measures are recommended by the CEO and discussed and ultimately approved by the Supervisory Board. For 2022, these measures included cultural change and people engagement, customer satisfaction, M&A integration (Cooper Lighting Solutions year 3 and Fluence), Brighter Lives, Better World targets (Green Deal revenue), digital roadmap impact, cyber protection, inventory management/reduction, sales growth for new growth engines and operational efficiency and disruption handling.\n\n## Performance achievements 2022\n\nPerformance against financial targets are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The assessment of performance under the annual incentive plan is concluded by the Supervisory Board.\n\nFor 2022, the company was impacted by the volatile and unpredictable external environment. Although Signify adapted to the challenges during the year, all three financial metrics were below threshold levels of performance expected. As a result, for each metric the resulting achievement reflected a below-threshold outcome and a 0% payout. Comparable sales growth was 1.2%, benefiting from traction in the professional segment, that was partly offset by China which continued to be impacted by COVID-driven measures and a softness in the consumer segment. Adjusted EBITA margin declined, mainly due to adverse currency impact and fixed cost under-absorption.. Finally, free cash flow amounted to 5.9% of sales and benefited from the disposal of non-strategic real estate assets.\n\nFor the realization of the financial measures of the annual incentive, the Supervisory Board considered whether any adjustments or discretion should be applied. The Supervisory Board concluded not to make any discretionary adjustments to the outcomes of the financial measures, nor were any changes made to the original targets set for the year 2022.\n\nFinally, the Supervisory Board assessed the achievement of the Board of Management relative to each of their individual goals and their collective team goals, The Supervisory Board is pleased with the continued progress of the employee Net Promoter Score, particularly given the challenges of the year. The employee Net Promoter Score has climbed steadily and reached its highest recorded level in 2022. The Q4 employee Net Promoter Score was 36 versus 32 at the end of 2021. From a customer perspective, the Supervisory Board is pleased to see the continued emphasis being placed on our customers. The Board of Management were able to hold the customer Net Promoter Score steady at 44, consistent with the end of year 2021, despite the volatility of the year. Finally, the Brighter Lives, Better World achievements continue to position Signify very well relative to the ambitious targets set for the  2025 program.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the results were mixed. The connected lighting business and growth platforms grew to reach almost EUR 2 billion of sales, and Green Deal revenue is tracking very well. However, overall performance on our growth for sustainability and differentiated offer strategic frontiers were not as expected. Cash optimization and inventory management were also not at expected levels for the year. Finally, there has been good progress on the\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Supervisory Board assessed that the Ukraine crises was very well managed by the Board of Management, as was re-energizing the organization in the aftermath of COVID.\n\nThe Supervisory Board acknowledged the volatile and challenging year and assessed the individual and team performance in the context of the year. The Supervisory Board assessed performance as modest. As a result ,the Supervisory Board has determined that the realized performance on this measure was 60%.\n\nThe summarized outcomes realized on all measures are as follows:\n\n| Performance measures                      | Weighting   | Threshold 50%   | Actual   | Payout %   | Weighted  payout %   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------|------------|----------------------|\n| Comparable sales growth                   | 30%         | 3.0 %           | 1.2%     | -%         | -%                   |\n| Adjusted EBITA                            | 30%         | 11.6 %          | 10.1 %   | -%         | -%                   |\n| Free cash flow                            | 20%         | 8.0 %           | 5.9 %    | -%         | -%                   |\n| Team and individual  performance measures | 20%         |                 | 60.0%    | 60.0%      | 12.0%                |\n| Multiple achieved                         |             |                 |          |            | 12.0%                |\n\nThe multiple achieved results in the following payout for each Board of Management member:\n\n## Annual incentive realization 2022 in EUR\n\n|                        | Annual  base   |    | On-target  % of  annual  base   | On-target  % of  annual  base   | Multiple  achieved   | Multiple  achieved   | Realized annual incentive (in EUR)   |\n|------------------------|----------------|----|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

The objective of the long-term incentive is to link pay with long-term sustainable value creation. In addition to the Board of Management, another approximately 700 employees globally are eligible for participation in a similar long-term incentive plan.\n\nThe main characteristics of the long-term incentive plan for the Board of Management are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The long-term incentive is granted in performance shares only and granted annually.\n- \u00b7 The vesting of performance shares is conditional upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three financial years and continued Signify employment.\n- \u00b7 Performance is measured using four performance measures in 2022: relative total shareholder return (25%), free cash flow (25%), return on capital employed (25%) and sustainability (25%).\n- \u00b7 Payout per performance measure can vary between 0% and 200%.\n\n## Performance measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Relative TSR\n\nThe vesting of 25% of the shares granted is subject to a TSR condition. Relative total shareholder return (TSR) measures the share price growth plus dividends paid over the threeyear performance period. Performance is expressed as a percentage. This percentage is compared to the TSR performance of companies included in the peer group specifically compiled for this purpose. The TSR performance is determined for each company in the peer group and the performances are ranked from top to bottom. Signify's position in the ranking, together with the payout curve, determines the payout level.\n\nIn 2022, the peer group consisted of the following companies:\n\n## TSR Peer Group\n\n| ABB               | Honeywell Int.   | Panasonic          |\n|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|\n| Acuity Brands     | Hubbell          | Signify            |\n| Eaton Corporation | Johnson Controls | Schneider Electric |\n| Fagerhult         | Legrand          | Toshiba            |\n| Hitachi           | MLS Co Ltd       | Zumtobel Group     |\n\nThe peer group is reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the companies in the group remain relevant peers. In case a peer needs to be replaced due to a corporate event (merger, acquisition, and so on) the Supervisory Board will ensure that the adjusted peer group remains aligned with the strategic objectives, the geographical spread and the business characteristics of Signify. Per January 1, 2022 Cree was replaced by MLS Co Ltd. This means that:\n\n- \u00b7 For the LTI 2020 grant (vesting in 2023) and the LTI 2021 grant (vesting in 2024), TSR will be calculated on a 'synthetic combination', i.e. Cree until January 1, 2022, and MLS as of January 1, 2022.\n- \u00b7 As of the LTI 2022 grant (vesting in 2025 and thereafter), MLS will replace Cree in the TSR peer group.\n\n## Performance-incentive zone for TSR in % of grant value\n\n| Ranking   |   15 |   14 |   13 |   12 |   11 |   10 |   9 |   8 |   7 |   6 |   5 | 4   | 3   | 2 1             |\n|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----------------|\n| Payout    |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |   0 |  75 | 100 | 125 | 150 |     |     | 175 200 200 200 |\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nThe vesting of another 25% of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a free cash flow target over the three-year performance period. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe vesting of 25% of the annual long-term incentive grant is dependent on how well Signify performs against the targets set with respect to the sustainability condition. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan. As targets set are usually both qualitative and quantitative, set ambitiously and adjusted regularly, the assessment of the performance is at the discretion of the Supervisory Board. The assessment will use tracked performance as input.\n\n## Return on capital employed\n\nThe vesting of the remaining 25% of the annual long-term incentive grant is linked to performance measured by a return on capital employed target. The targets and intervals around these measures are determined by the Supervisory Board, based on the company's strategic, multi-year plan.\n\nIn 2022, performance shares were granted to the members of the Board of Management. These grants are governed by the Signify long-term incentive plan. The grant is made on the basis of the average closing share price of the three months preceding the date of grant. In this way, the Signify granting policy ensures mitigation of share price volatility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The shares under this grant vest on May 4, 2023. The payout results are set forth below.\n\nIn determining the achievement of the 2020 grant, the Supervisory Board considered the impact of the benefit derived from the disposal of the non-strategic real estate assets. The Supervisory Board determined that this disposal reflected operational management of assets, and thus no adjustments were made to the 2022 year outcomes of free cash flow or ROCE.  In conclusion, no discretionary adjustments were made to the results, nor to the original targets set in 2020.\n\n## Relative TSR (25% weighting)\n\nThe TSR achieved by Signify during the performance period was 23.3%. This positioned Signify as the 12 th ranked company in the peer group shown in the following table, resulting in an achievement of 0%.\n\nJanuary 1, 2020 - December 31, 2022\n\n|    | Rank Company       | TSR performance   |\n|----|--------------------|-------------------|\n|  1 | Eaton Corporation  | 86.1%             |\n|  2 | Hubbell            | 80.4%             |\n|  3 | Hitachi            | 74.6%             |\n|  4 | Schneider Electric | 65.8%             |\n|  5 | Johnson Controls   | 55.5%             |\n|  6 | ABB                | 52.4%             |\n|  7 | Toshiba            | 49.1%             |\n|  8 | Acuity Brands      | 39.7%             |\n|  9 | MLS                | 38.0%             |\n| 10 | Panasonic          | 28.0%             |\n| 11 | Honeywell          | 24.2%             |\n| 12 | Signify            | 23.3%             |\n| 13 | Legrand            | 13.9%             |\n| 14 | Zumtobel Group     | (4.8) %           |\n| 15 | Fagerhult          | (25.9) %          |\n\n## Free cash flow (25% weighting)\n\nThe LTI Plan free cash flow payout and targets set at the beginning of the performance period were as follows:\n\n|                 | Payout   | As % of sales   |\n|-----------------|----------|-----------------|\n| Below threshold | -%       | < 8.2%          |\n| Threshold       | 40%      | 8.2%            |\n| Target          | 100%     | 8.9%            |\n| Maximum         | 200%     | 9.6%            |\n\nOver the three-year performance period, an amount of EUR 1,876 million free cash was generated (excluding pension de-risking and IFRS 16), representing 9% of sales. In light thereof, the Supervisory Board determined the LTI Plan free cash flow achievement as 110%.\n\n## Return on Capital Employed (25% weighting)\n\nReturn on Capital Employed (ROCE) was a new metric in the 2020 grant. For 2022, ROCE was based on the outcomes in the last year of the plan period (2022), excluding pension liabilities. Based on an 13.8% achievement of the ROCE metric, the Supervisory Board determined the LTI Plan ROCE achievement as 200%.\n\n|                 | Payout   | ROCE %   |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|\n| Below threshold | -%       | < 10.6%  |\n| Threshold       | 40%      | 10.6%    |\n| Target          | 100%     | 11.1%    |\n| Maximum         | 200%     | 11.6%    |\n\n## Sustainability (25% weighting)\n\nThe sustainability objectives for 2022 were based on the intent to double Signify's impact in the areas of climate action, the circular economy, Brighter lives revenues and women in leadership positions by 2025. In all areas, significant progress has been made relative to the trajectory to deliver on the ambitions by 2025. Signify is on track to deliver against the ambitious goal of doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5 \u00ba C scenario. Circular revenues have exceeded the ambition set for 2022 with an increase in contributions from circular products, systems or services. Brighter lives revenue has delivered an increase in revenues coming from lighting innovations that increase food availability, safety and security, or health and well-being and remains on track to double by 2025.. Women in leadership positions has increased by 11% from 2019, however, it is behind the more ambitious path that was set for 2022 for the trajectory to double the percentage of women in senior leadership roles by 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These guidelines are designed to further align the interest of the members of the Board of Management (and certain other leaders within Signify) with the interests of its shareholders. For the CEO, the value in Signify shares to be held is 300% of base salary and for the other members of the Board of Management it is 200% of base salary. The guidelines require that all after-tax shares be retained until the required level is met.\n\nIn addition, members of the Board of Management shall comply with holding requirements under the Dutch corporate governance code. This effectively means that members of the Board of Management shall hold all after-tax shares received under the long-term incentive plan for a period of at least five years from the date of grant.\n\n## Signify Shares held by Board members in number of shares\n\n|                        | December 31, 2021   | Holdings as % of base  1   | December 31, 2022   | Holdings as % of base  1   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| E.H.E.

The net pension arrangement is in line with all other Signify employees in the Netherlands whose pensionable salary exceeds the cap. Participation in this net pension arrangement is voluntary.\n- \u00b7 A temporary gross transition allowance, for a maximum period of eight years (first five years in full; year 6: 75%; year 7: 50%, year 8: 25%). The temporary gross transition allowance only applies to members of the Board of Management who were employed before January 1, 2015, and participated in the former executive pension plan, before the change to the flex pension plan per January 1, 2015, with the capping of pension accruals and increase of pensionable\n\n<!-- image -->",

Free cash flow has declined from 2021, as has the Signify share price. The total remuneration of the Board of Management is aligned to the company performance. Total remuneration for the CEO has declined by 37%, while for the other Board of Management members it has declined by 24% and 30%. Annual incentive decreased significantly from 2021, driven by below-threshold outcomes on financial incentive plan metrics as detailed in subsection 9.2.4. The total remuneration of the CEO reflects the completion of the pension transition allowance as detailed in sub-section 9.2.9 as well as the significantly reduced annual incentive outcome for 2022. The development of free cash flow has decreased by 28% from 2021, while Signify share price has decreased by 23%.\n\nEmployee average total compensation has increased by 5% for 2022, reflecting employee salary adjustments during the year.

Additionally, the acquisition of Pierlite and Fluence increased the number employees in Pacific and the United States.\n\n## 9.2.10 Signify's internal pay ratio\n\nThe remuneration design for the members of the Board of Management is an integral part of the overall pay structure within the company. Signify uses the Hay system to evaluate and grade the various positions within its organization. This means that the company uses a standardized method for determining the appropriate benefits for each of the respective job levels within the company. Using the Hay grading system also ensures that the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management is aligned with and is relative to the remuneration of Signify employees holding other positions within the company. The remuneration of senior staff within Signify is based on the same components as the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Code requires reporting on the pay ratio. Signify's pay ratio reflects the average total compensation of the total global employee workforce, relative to the total remuneration package of the CEO. This has resulted in the following outcome:\n\n| Fiscal year   | CEO total  remuneration  1   | Average total  compensation employees  2   |   Resulting pay  ratio |\n|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2022          | 2,044,154                    | 53,766                                     |                     38 |\n| 2021  3       | 3,228,091                    | 51,337                                     |                     63 |\n| 2020          | 3,245,335                    | 51,780                                     |                     63 |\n| 2019          | 2,822,104                    | 60,601                                     |                     47 |\n| 2018          | 2,564,306                    | 61,264                                     |                     42 |\n\nIn light of transparency and clarity, Signify applies a methodology to calculate the internal pay ratio that is IFRS-driven (i.e. linked to Signify's notes to the Consolidated financial statements).\n\nFor 2022, average total compensation for employees increased by 5%. The trend until 2022 had been a decline in employee average total compensation as a result of the changing geographic spread of the employee population and the acquisitions that have occurred. Since 2018, a greater proportion of our employee population has shifted from Western Europe to South East Asia, Asia, and Latin America. The acquisitions of Cooper Lighting and Klite resulted in an increase in the employee population from 2019 to 2020 and the majority of that increase was in\n\nLatin America, India and China. The acquisition of Pierlite and Fluence in 2022 increased the employee population in Pacific and the United States in contrast. In addition, Signify has been increasing the employee population in India due to growth in R&D software and IT. As a result, average employee pay had been trending down until 2022, reflective of this significant shift in employee geographic spread. This impacted significantly the pay ratio from 2019 to 2021.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio has declined significantly from 2021 to 2022, as a result of the very limited payout of the annual incentive for 2022 and the completion of the pension transition allowance for the CEO versus the increase in average employee total compensation. Signify believes that the pay ratio over 2022 aligns with Signify's performance for the year.\n\n## 9.2.11 Claw back and change of control\n\nThe annual cash incentive and the long-term incentive of the members of the Board of Management are subject to adjustment and claw back provisions. Pursuant hereto, the company can (a) revise an incentive prior to payment if unaltered payment would be unreasonable and unfair, (b) recover an incentive if it was granted on the basis of incorrect information on the fulfillment of the incentive goals or the conditions for payment of the incentive, and (c) recoup incentives in the circumstances set forth in the services contract with the member of the Board of Management concerned.\n\nIn the event of a change of control of the company, the Supervisory Board can, at its sole discretion, decide to accelerate the vesting of any unvested awards under the long-term incentive, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions up to the date of the completion of the change of control.\n\nNo variable remuneration was clawed-back in 2022.\n\n## 9.2.12 Additional arrangements\n\nUnless relevant law provides otherwise, the members of the Board of Management and of the Supervisory Board shall be reimbursed by the company for various costs and expenses, such as reasonable costs of defending claims, as formalized in the Articles of Association. Under certain circumstances, described in the Articles of Association, such as an action or failure to act by a member of the Board of Management or a member of the Supervisory Board that can be characterized as intentional ('opzettelijk'), intentionally reckless ('bewust roekeloos') or seriously culpable ('ernstig verwijtbaar'), there will be no entitlement to this reimbursement. The company has also provided liability insurance (Directors and Officers) for the persons concerned.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Termination of the services contract is subject to a notice period of six months for either party. The terms and conditions of these service agreements have been aligned with the relevant Dutch Corporate Governance Code provisions.\n\n## 9.2.14 Severance arrangements\n\nContractual severance arrangements of members of the Board of Management comply with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and provide for compensation for the loss of income resulting from a termination of employment and are capped at one time the annual base salary.\n\nNo severance is payable in case the agreement is terminated early at the initiative of the Board of Management member.\n\nThe Board of Management member shall not be entitled to a severance payment if the contract is terminated for urgent cause ('dringende reden').

The divisions are responsible for the development of their strategy and product portfolio.\n\nIn addition, to manage its global sales channels, the company's commercial organization is currently structured along several geographical market clusters. These market clusters are principally responsible for driving and managing sales, managing customer relationships and delivering the commercial activities of the business across the company's markets, covering commercial activities in almost all countries. The company operates in many countries through its subsidiaries and affiliated companies as well as via a limited number of branch offices, which primarily act under the Signify trade name.\n\nDivisions and market clusters are supported by centralized shared services with respect to, among other functions, legal, finance, human resources, business transformation, strategy, marketing, innovation and operations.\n\n## 10.2 Board of Management\n\nThe Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. The Board of Management focuses on long-term value creation for the company and its business and takes the interests of relevant stakeholders into account. In performing its duties, the Board of Management is guided by the interests of the company and its affiliated enterprises, taking into consideration the interests of its stakeholders.\n\nAmong other responsibilities, the Board of Management drives the company's management agenda, defines and deploys the strategic direction, identifies opportunities and risks connected with its business activities and strategy, pursues the operational and financial objectives of the company, and monitors corporate social responsibility issues relevant to the company.\n\nThe Board of Management is accountable to the Supervisory Board for its actions and decisions. The Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Board of Management have regular contact with the Chair and other members of the Supervisory Board, attend most parts of the Supervisory Board meetings, and provide the Supervisory Board with the information it needs to fulfil its responsibilities.\n\nCertain decisions of the Board of Management require Supervisory Board approval. These decisions include important proposals for capital expenditures,\n\nacquisitions, divestments, decisions concerning financial and operational objectives and strategy to achieve such objectives, changes to corporate policies, as well as the annual operating plan.\n\nThe functioning and decision-making within the Board of Management are laid down in its Rules of Procedure which can be found on the company's website.\n\n## Appointment\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed by the General Meeting of Shareholders (the General Meeting) upon a nomination drawn up by the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management are appointed for a maximum term of four years, it being understood that this term expires at the end of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after the year of their appointment. Reappointment is possible for consecutive terms of four years or, if applicable, until a later retirement date or other termination date in the fourth year, unless the General Meeting resolves otherwise. Members may be suspended by the Supervisory Board and the General Meeting, and dismissed by the latter.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management follows the board profile which aims for an appropriate combination of knowledge and experience among its members, encompassing industrial, technology &\n\ninnovation, projects & infrastructure, digital & marketing, financial, economic, IT, social & sustainability aspects of international business and society, in relation to the global character of its business. This profile also applies for the Supervisory Board, and can be found on the company's website. The size of the Board of Management may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile.\n\n## 10.3 Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board, in the two-tier board structure under Dutch law, is a separate body that is independent of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of the company. The Supervisory Board supervises the policies and management and the general affairs of the company. The Supervisory Board appoints a Chair and a Vice-Chair from among its members.

        "page_content": "## Independence of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board is a separate corporate body that is independent of the Board of Management. Its independent character is also reflected in the requirement that members of the Supervisory Board can be neither a member of the Board of Management nor an employee of the company. Each member of the Supervisory Board meets the independence requirements as stated in the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting on the nomination of the Supervisory Board, which nomination may be binding.\n\nThe term of appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board will end at the closing of the AGM to be held in the fourth year after appointment. In line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the members of the Supervisory Board are eligible for reappointment for a period of maximum four years. Subsequent re-appointments are possible for a period of two years, which may be extended by a re-appointment of maximum two years. The reasons for re-appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board after an eight-year term must be included in the report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAs from 2022, a mandatory gender quota applies under Dutch law requiring supervisory\n\nboards to be composed of at least one-third men and one-third women. The Supervisory Board meets this target for the financial year 2022. The gender quota needs to be observed in case of a new appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board and a reappointment of an acting member of the Supervisory Board after an eight-year term. Any new appointment or re-appointment after an eight-year term resulting in the composition of the Supervisory Board not meeting this gender quota, will be null and void. An appointment or re-appointment that does not contribute to the gender balance will only be allowed under certain exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Composition\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board follows the same board profile that applies to the Board of Management, see paragraph 10.2 above.\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board shall also be in accordance with the best practice provisions on independence of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code as well as Dutch law restrictions on the overall number of supervisory positions that a member of the Supervisory Board may hold. Each member shall be capable of assessing the broad outline of the overall management of the company.\n\nThe size of the Supervisory Board may vary over time, as considered appropriate to support its profile. In 2022, the Supervisory Board consisted of six independent members.\n\n## 10.4 Supervisory Board Committees\n\nIn 2022, the Supervisory Board had four committees: The Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Digital Committee. Each of the committees has a preparatory and/or advisory role to the Supervisory Board. They report their findings to the full Supervisory Board, which is ultimately responsible for all decision-making. Information on the work and composition of the committees during 2022 is set out in chapter 8, Supervisory Board report.\n\nEach committee has a charter describing its role, responsibilities and functioning. These charters are published on the company's website. The responsibilities of each Committee are described in more detail below.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities for the integrity of the company's financial statements, the financial reporting process, the system of internal business controls and risk management, the internal and external audit process, the internal and external auditor's qualifications, its independence and its performance, as well as the company's process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations and the Integrity code. It reviews the company's annual and interim\n\nfinancial statements (including non-financial information) prior to publication and advises the Supervisory Board on the adequacy and appropriateness of internal control policies and internal audit programs and their findings. It furthermore maintains contact with and supervises the external auditor and it prepares the nomination of an external auditor for appointment by the General Meeting.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets at least once before the publication of the quarterly and annual accounts of the company.\n\n## Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee\n\nThe Corporate Governance and Nomination & Selection Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Advises the Supervisory Board on the selection and appointment of members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management.\n- \u00b7 Prepares the selection criteria and appointment procedures for members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Board of Management and proposing the profile for the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 Supervises the policy on selection criteria, and is involved in the selection and appointment of the company's leadership team, appointments of which are subject to the Supervisory Board's approval.\n- \u00b7 Periodically assesses the size and composition of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, and the functioning of the individual members, and proposes on appointments and reappointments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the Supervisory Board members, and in line with the Dutch law requirement, Signify aims that at least onethird are men and at least one-third are women. For the Board of Management, Signify aims at having at least one man and at least one woman for a board with three members, and at least two men and two women for a board with five members.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the individual members of the Board of Management is determined by the Supervisory Board based on the remuneration policy adopted by the General Meeting. The remuneration of the individual members of the Supervisory Board, as well as the additional remuneration for its Chair and the members of its committees, is determined by the General Meeting.\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, the remuneration policies must be adopted by the AGM at least every four years. The resolution of the general meeting to adopt the remuneration policy requires a 75% majority of the votes cast, unless the Articles of Association explicitly provide otherwise, which Signify's Articles of Association do not. The remuneration report relating to the previous financial year must be submitted to the AGM on an annual basis for an advisory vote.\n\nThe current remuneration policies for Board of Management and the Supervisory Board were adopted by the AGM in 2020. The composition of the remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the members of the Supervisory Board and the remuneration policies are described in chapter 9, Remuneration report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Relevant matters relating to conflicts of interests, if any, must be approved by the Supervisory Board and shall be mentioned in the Annual Report for the financial year in question.\n\nThe rules for conflict of interest applicable to the members of the Board of Management also apply to the members of the Supervisory Board. No conflict of interest as referred to in this section occurred during 2022.\n\n## Outside positions\n\nPursuant to Dutch law, a person cannot be appointed as a managing or executive director of a large Dutch company if he or she already holds a supervisory position at more than two other large Dutch companies or if he or she is the chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company. Also, a person cannot be appointed as a supervisory director or nonexecutive director of a large Dutch company if he or she already holds a supervisory position at five or more other large Dutch companies, whereby the position of chair of the supervisory board or one-tier board of another large Dutch company counts twice.\n\nThe acceptance by a member of the Board of Management of a position as a member of a supervisory board or a position of non-\n\nexecutive director in a one-tier board at another company requires the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board is required to be notified of other important positions (to be) held by a member of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board member must inform the Chair of the Supervisory Board before accepting a position outside the company.\n\nAll members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board complied with the restriction as set out above for the financial year 2022.\n\n## 10.6 General Meeting of Shareholders\n\nThe main rights of the General Meeting are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Appoint, suspend and dismiss members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 Adopt the remuneration policy and approve equity-based incentive plans for members of the Board of Management and adopt the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board.\n- \u00b7 Adopt the annual accounts.\n- \u00b7 Declare dividends.\n- \u00b7 Discharge the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board from liability in respect of the performance of their respective duties in the previous financial year.\n- \u00b7 Appoint the external auditor as required by Dutch law.\n- \u00b7 Adopt amendments to the Articles of Association and proposals to dissolve or liquidate the company.\n- \u00b7 Issue shares or rights to shares, to restrict or exclude preemptive rights of shareholders and to repurchase or cancel outstanding shares; and\n- \u00b7 Approve other important matters, such as major acquisitions or the sale of a substantial part of the company, as required by law.\n\nThe AGM is held within six months after the end of each financial year to discuss the annual report and decide on the adoption of the financial statements and dividend proposal as well as the discharge of the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe AGM can be called by the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management is entitled to determine the record date in accordance with Dutch law. The agenda, explanatory notes thereto and the procedure for attendance are published on the company's website. Holders of ordinary shares in the aggregate representing at least 3% of the total issued share capital may submit proposals for the AGM agenda. Such proposals must be made in writing at least 60 days before the AGM to the Board of Management. Any written request must comply with the procedure stipulated by the Board of Management, which is published on the company's website.\n\nEach ordinary share confers the right to cast one vote in the General Meeting. There are\n\nno special statutory rights attached to the shares of the company and no restrictions on the voting rights of the company's shares exist. Subject to certain exceptions provided by Dutch law or the Articles of Association, resolutions of the General Meeting are passed by an absolute majority of votes cast. A resolution to amend the Articles of Association requires a simple majority of the votes cast if the resolution is adopted on a proposal of the Board of Management. Otherwise, such resolution requires a majority of at least three-fourths of the votes cast provided that the majority represents more than half of the issued share capital. Pursuant to Dutch law, no votes may be cast at a General Meeting in respect of shares which are held by the company.\n\n## Share capital and repurchase and issue of (rights to) shares\n\nThe authorized share capital of the company amounts to EUR 6 million, divided into 300 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of one eurocent each and 300 million preference shares, also with a nominal value of one eurocent each. On December 31, 2022, the issued share capital amounted to EUR 1.28 million, divided into 128,344,238 ordinary shares and no preference shares. All shares are fully paid-up.

At the same time, the Board of Management was authorized to acquire ordinary shares on the stock exchange or otherwise, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, at a price between the nominal value of the ordinary shares and 110% of the market price of the ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam, provided that the maximum number of ordinary shares the company may acquire and hold does not exceed 10% of the issued share capital as at May 17, 2022, plus an additional 10% of the issued capital as at that same date in connection with the execution of share repurchases for capital reduction purposes.\n\n## 10.7 Stichting Continu\u00efteit Signify\n\nStichting Continu\u00efteit Signify, a foundation ( stichting ) incorporated under Dutch law, has been granted a call option right to acquire preference shares in the share capital of the company. The possibility of issuing preference shares in the share capital of the company is a defensive measure. The foundation may resolve to exercise the call option at its sole discretion without the consent of the company. On the exercise of the call option, the foundation is entitled to acquire, and the company shall have the unconditional obligation to issue, preference shares up to a maximum corresponding with 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the company. This shall exclude the preference shares as issued and outstanding immediately prior to the exercise of the call option, less one preference share, from which maximum any preference shares already placed with the foundation at the time of the exercise of the call option must be deducted.\n\nThe call option can be exercised by the foundation in order to, for example:\n\n- \u00b7 Prevent, slow down or otherwise complicate an unsolicited takeover bid for and an unsolicited acquisition of shares by means of an acquisition at the stock market or otherwise.\n- \u00b7 Prevent and countervail concentration of voting rights in the General Meeting; and/ or\n- \u00b7 Resist unwanted influence by and pressure from shareholders to amend the strategy of the company.\n\nIf the foundation exercises the call option, the company issues such number of preference shares as for which the foundation exercised its call option. No preference shares had been issued as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe foundation's objects are to further the interests of Signify N.V., the enterprises maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group. The foundation will act in such a way that the interests of the company and of those enterprises are optimally safeguarded and that influences which could affect the independence, continuity or identity of the company, the enterprise maintained by the company and the companies affiliated with the company in a group in conflict with those interests are deterred to the best of the foundation's ability.\n\nThe foundation has the right to file a petition with the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to commence an inquiry procedure within the meaning of section 2:344 Dutch Civil Code.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the board of the foundation was composed of the following independent members: Jos Streppel (chair), Sietze Hepkema and Jan Willem Baud.\n\nFurthermore, it should be noted that also in the event of (an attempt at) a hostile takeover or other attempt to obtain (de facto) control of the company, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are authorized to exercise in the interests of Signify all powers vested in them.\n\n## 10.8 Change of Control\n\nThe company is not a party to any material agreement that takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control of the company following a take-over bid as referred to in section 5:70 of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act, other than the credit agreement entered into with a syndicate of financial institutions which established term loans and a revolving credit facility, certain bi-lateral credit agreements that have been entered into to refinance term loans, the Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 and the Trade Mark License Agreement entered into with Koninklijke Philips N.V. The credit agreement includes a change of control provision which allows the lenders to cancel the commitment and declare any outstanding amounts under the agreement, immediately due and payable whereupon such amounts will become immediately due and payable. The provisions applicable to all Eurobonds issued by the company in 2020 contain a 'Change of Control Put Event'. This means that if the company experienced such an event with respect to such bonds, the company might be required to redeem or purchase the bonds at its principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.",

In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, the Supervisory Board selects and nominates an external auditor for appointment, upon advice by the Audit Committee. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee assess the functioning of the external auditor, taking the observations from the Board of Management into account. Ernst & Young Accountants LLP was first appointed as external auditor of the company on May 13, 2016, for the financial years 2016 through 2019. On May 14, 2019, the General Meeting re-appointed Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as external auditor of the company for the financial years 2020 through 2022. The agenda for the upcoming AGM will include a proposal to re-appoint Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as external auditor of the company for the financial years 2023 through 2025.\n\nThe services provided by the external auditor are pre-approved by the Audit Committee on the basis of the annual audit services engagement agreed with the external auditor. Unless general pre-approval has been given at the beginning of the year, all proposed services require such specific preapproval.\n\nIn principle, the external auditor attends all meetings of the Audit Committee. The findings of the external auditor, the audit approach and the risk analysis are also discussed at these meetings. The external auditor attends the meeting of the Supervisory Board at which the report of the external auditor with respect to the audit of the annual accounts is discussed, and at which the annual accounts are approved. The external auditor may also attend the Annual General Meeting to elaborate on its audit and auditor's report and is available for questions.\n\n## Auditor independence\n\nThe Audit Committee evaluates at least annually the external auditor's independence. The lead auditor in charge of the Signify account is changed every five years; such change took place as of the start of the financial year 2021. Furthermore, Dutch law requires the rotation of the external audit firm after the firm has completed the statutory audit of the company for a period of 10 consecutive years.\n\n## Prohibition on non-audit services\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the proposed audit scope, approach and fees as well as services that the external auditor provides to the company. Dutch law requires the separation of audit and non-audit services, meaning the company's external auditor is not allowed to provide prohibited non-audit services.\n\n## 10.10 Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe company fully endorses the underlying principles of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, and is committed to adhering to the best practices of the Code as much as possible.\n\nThe company fully complies with the Code and applies all its principles and best practice provisions that relate to the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board. The updated Dutch Corporate Governance Code as published on December 20, 2022 will be applied within Signify in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## 12 Risk factors and risk management\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt Signify, we believe taking risks is an inherent part of entrepreneurial behavior. By deploying a structured risk management process, management is able to take risks in a controlled manner. The company's risk management and controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance that strategic and financial business objectives are met. This is done by integrating management control into the daily operations, by ensuring compliance with legal requirements and by safeguarding the integrity of the company's financial reporting and its related disclosures. The components of our risk management process are listed below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12.1 Establish a strong risk management environment\n\nSignify's risk management environment is embedded in the corporate governance, the business control framework and the Integrity code.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nCorporate governance is the system by which a company is directed and controlled. Good corporate governance derives from, among other things, solid internal controls and high ethical standards.\n\nThe Board of Management is responsible for managing the risks associated with the company's activities and for defining the company's risk appetite. The Board of Management is assisted by the company's leadership team, which participates on a quarterly basis in audit risk and control meetings to identify critical risks and to review progress on the implementation of risk responses. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board provides oversight for the system of internal business controls and risk management. Internal audits, external audits or management self-assessment are reported to and discussed by the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis. An in-depth description of the company's corporate governance structure can be found in chapter 10, Corporate governance.\n\n## Business Control Framework\n\nThe company's Business Control Framework (BCF) sets the standard for risk management and business controls in the company. The objectives of the BCF are to maintain (i) integrated management control of the company's operations in order to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and related disclosure, and (ii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The company has designed its BCF based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The company regularly evaluates and improves its BCF to align with business dynamics and good practices.\n\n## Integrity code\n\nActing with integrity is the cornerstone for the success of our business and for achieving our purpose. It is integral to the values that define us as a company. Acting with integrity means making the right choices when faced with ethical dilemmas, and holding ourselves and each other to high standards of behavior.\n\nThe Integrity code has been adopted by the Board of Management. It applies to all employees of Signify N.V. and its controlled subsidiaries. The Integrity code formulates minimum standards of behavior. The company has underlying policies that form an integral part of the Integrity code.\n\nTo increase the level of awareness and to create global engagement, the company has established a network of Compliance Officers in countries where the company has a presence, on each significant site, and at",

        "page_content": "Division, Market Group and Functional level. The activities and responsibilities of this network are focused on providing expertise and support on Integrity code-related matters to managers and employees. Furthermore, the Signify central privacy office safeguards the governance of personal data together with privacy contact points across divisions, markets and functions.\n\nThe Integrity code is supported by mechanisms that ensure standardized reporting, escalation and investigation of concerns. These mechanisms are based on the Integrity code Reporting Policy that urges employees and third parties to report any concerns they may have regarding business conduct in relation to the Integrity code, either through a Compliance Officer or through the Signify Ethics line. The Signify Ethics line enables employees and third parties to report a concern either by telephone or online via a web intake form. All concerns raised are consistently registered in a single database and are investigated in accordance with standardized investigation procedures. An overview of the reporting activities for 2022 is given in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sub-section 16.3.5, Business ethics.\n\n## Define risk\n\n## 12.2 appetite\n\nRisk management in Signify focuses on the following risk categories: strategic, operational, compliance and financial risks. The Board of Management has determined the risk appetite and seeks to manage risk within these boundaries. The risk appetite is different for each of the risk categories:\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nStrategic risks include economic and political developments and the effects of actions taken to anticipate and respond to market circumstances. The company has a medium strategic risk appetite and is prepared to take some reasonable strategic risks, balancing the need to capture return from opportunities and management of the risks.\n\nThe company's key strategic risks are discussed in section 12.5 and include technological change, competition, global political and economic instability, digitalization, acquisitions and integration and concentration risk.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nOperational risks include adverse unexpected developments resulting from internal processes, people and systems, or from external events that are linked to the running of each business. The company has a low operational risk appetite and aims to minimize\n\ndownside risks to maintain the high quality of its products, systems and services, reliable IT systems and sustainability commitments.\n\nThe company's key operational risks are discussed in section 12.5 and include supply disruptions, innovation, cyber-attacks and security breaches, new organizational capabilities, and climate change.\n\n## Compliance risks\n\nThese risks cover unanticipated failures to implement, or comply with, appropriate laws, regulations, policies and procedures. The company is, due to its global footprint, exposed to risk of fraud and other misconduct in violation of the integrity code and/or applicable laws and regulations, governmental investigation and legal proceedings in relation thereto.\n\nThe company has a very low compliance risk appetite and is committed to full compliance to relevant laws, regulations and its Integrity code.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company faces financial risks outside its control related to treasury, accounting and reporting, pensions, and tax. Here, the risk appetite is low. Therefore, the company aims to minimize the impact of financial risk, and it follows a conservative risk management approach in these areas. Furthermore, the company is committed to transparent and truthful accounting and reporting to allow users of the financial statements to take decisions considering these risks.\n\n## 12.3 Risk assessment and control\n\nIn order to provide a comprehensive view of the company's business strategy and activities, risks and opportunities are identified in a structured way, combining elements of top-down and bottom-up approaches.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nThe company leadership team identifies the key risks as part of the strategic review process. In a subsequent workshop, the leadership team ranks the risks based on impact, likelihood, risk criticality and control effectiveness. As part of the strategic review cycle, initiatives are defined to mitigate the risks. Owners are assigned for each of the strategic initiatives, and they are then accountable for ensuring adequate risk mitigation and for monitoring the implementation of mitigation measures. Each quarter, the key risks are discussed during the audit and risk committee meeting. Reported risks and opportunities are analyzed for potential cumulative effects and are aggregated at Division, Market Group and company level.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Operational risk\n\nRisks are reported on a regular basis as part of the business performance reviews or, for specific topics, through dedicated risk committees. In addition, on an annual basis, the top risks are identified by company leadership. Relevant risks, including those associated with business opportunities, are prioritized in terms of potential impact and likelihood, considering quantitative and/or qualitative aspects, and are reviewed together with the Board of Management. On a quarterly basis, risks and controls are reviewed with the Divisions, Market Groups and specific Functions in the audit risk committee.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nThe Integrity Committee is the ultimate body within Signify to administer the organization's Integrity Code Legal Compliance Program. It does so by maintaining oversight of the development and implementation of the Integrity code, including the monitoring of its effectiveness. The Integrity Committee is chaired by the Chief Legal Officer. Its members include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief HR Officer, Head of Internal Audit and Head of Legal Compliance.\n\nWith an annual Integrity code selfassessment process forming part of the internal controls over financial reporting (ICS), compliance to the Integrity code forms part of management's ICS monitoring process. Management of each business unit signs off on controls relating to compliance with the Integrity code, with this confirmation forming part of the annual certification statement on Business Controls. Noncompliance issues are highlighted and, if\n\nsignificant, they are reported to the Board of Management through the Certification Statement process.\n\nEmployees are requested to state their commitment to the Integrity code after having completed e-learnings. In 2022, employees were required to complete one or more e-learnings on the Integrity code and related legal compliance domains. Specific target groups were required to participate in recurring (virtual) classroom trainings. In addition, each year, Finance and Procurement employees are asked to sign off on the Financial and the Procurement Codes of Ethics, respectively. All executives are asked to sign off on the Integrity code annually to confirm their awareness of and compliance with the code. Violations of the Integrity code will result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.\n\n## Financial risk\n\nThe company has implemented a global standard for ICS. ICS, together with the established accounting procedures, are designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect transactions necessary to permit preparation of financial statements, that policies and procedures are carried out by qualified personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and do not contain any material misstatements.\n\nInternal controls are an inherent part of the processes in our company, where the responsibility for executing these internal controls is with the persons that carry out these processes. The design and maintenance of the global standard for\n\ninternal controls is with the (global) business process owners and the dedicated ICS team.\n\nAn ICS monitoring process exists for all material reporting units, whereby business process owners engaged in the key financial processes perform self-assessments on several key controls, document the results, and take corrective action where necessary. ICS supports business and functional management in a periodic cycle of assessment and monitoring of the control environment.\n\nOn an annual basis, management's accountability for business controls is recorded through the formal issuance of a Certification Statement on Business Controls and a Letter of Representation by Divisions, reporting units and Functional management to the Board of Management. Any deficiencies noted in the design and operating effectiveness of controls over financial reporting, which were not completely remediated, are evaluated at year-end by the Board of Management. The Board of Management's statement, including its conclusions regarding the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, can be found in chapter 13, Statement of the Board of Management.\n\nThe global tax strategy and policy are aligned with our business and sustainability strategies and are published on the company's website. The Board of Management, enabling functions, Divisions and Markets are advised on tax matters by Group tax to ensure both the needs of the business and of the tax function are balanced. The company also participates in national and international forums of experts to represent its interests.\n\nIn addition, the company has corporate requirements for the management of the company's legal entities in line with tax legislation. Also refer to chapter 16, Sustainability statements.\n\nFor further details on financial risks please refer to chapter 14, Consolidated financial statements, note 9, Income tax, note 25, Post-employment benefits and note 29, Financial risk management.\n\n## 12.4 Changes in 2022\n\nIn 2021, the risk workshop and strategic review processes were integrated. In 2022, the risk mitigation process is further improved by having stronger links with relevant strategic initiatives and follow ups on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn 2022, we started the implementation of our internal control framework in our recent acquisitions Pierlite and Fluence.\n\nEmployees have been provided with a new Privacy and Data Protection Learning Path in 2022 to work with the central Privacy Management Software, enabling a better user experience whilst interacting with the privacy office. Additionally, need-based functional privacy trainings have been provided alongside train-the-trainer sessions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At present, a  relatively small part of the worldwide installed base of light points is  connected. A cornerstone of Signify's strategy is to focus on and invest in its connected                                                                   | Signify is actively developing and investing in technology platforms and software  applications to bring (more advanced) connected lighting systems to the  market. Part of this strategy is to strongly focus on the interoperability of its  applications and to incorporate different connectivity technologies in its  connected lighting portfolio, thereby addressing different needs in the market.                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                      | lighting offerings, such as its Interact offerings for the professional market and  Hue, WiZ smart lighting offerings for the consumer market.

The risk is that the extent and speed of adoption of connected lighting  systems and services does not develop as anticipated, or that Signify is unable  to successfully implement its strategy in connected lighting. | Additionally, Signify plays a leading role in developing the market for connected  lighting systems, in building awareness of the benefits of connected lighting,  and in forging partnerships and alliances.

In particular, both the Russia-Ukraine war with the resulting high level of inflation and the Chinese zero-COVID policy have had an adverse effect on consumer and customer spending, and hence on the company's sales in 2022. Persistent supply chain disruptions from China impaired the company's ability to meet existing customer demand and have affected customer satisfaction levels. Separately, the company's result was negatively impacted by the rising cost of energy, disproportionately impacting the Conventional Products Division as it uses glass furnaces in the production of Conventional Lighting, and as lower transport density leads to a significant worsening of transportation cost. And as the passing-through of disproportionate cost increases to consumer price increases promotes an accelerated switch to LED Lighting, there is potential for further disruption to the company's conventional lamps business.\n\nSignify depends on external suppliers and, to a large extent, on the production of components and LED products from Asian countries. The risk of this high dependency is that suppliers are not able to deliver (raw) materials, components or services in a timely manner for Signify to meet customer demand.\n\nNext to this, the production and shipping of products and components could be interrupted by conflicts, natural disasters, such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods caused by climate change, or pandemic diseases.\n\nFinally, increasing geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, such as local manufacturing requirements, might disrupt the company's operations. This might limit the company's ability to leverage and draw efficiencies from its global (manufacturing) footprint.\n\nAt the macro level, Signify actively engages in global forums focused on the benefits of globalization. Signify is also committed to highly credible industry organizations globally to support the stabilization of global trade.\n\nIn order to minimize the impact of instability on its business, Signify closely follows and reviews (geo)political and economic developments and takes these into account in both its short- and medium-term operational planning.\n\nTo mitigate potential supply chain inefficiencies, tariff impacts arising from geopolitical tensions and trade protectionism, and to address continued uncertainty from COVID interventions, Signify leverages its global (manufacturing) footprint and makes adjustments to its sourcing base when needed. The company has also launched actions throughout the organization to secure the supply of components and to maximize the delivery of existing customer orders. Inflation in Commodity and Energy prices is offset through a combination of cost savings and price increases.\n\nSignify has built a supplier risk plan in which at risk suppliers are identified using criteria that take into account the geographical location of the supplier, and the technologies and processes used. In addition, Signify has enhanced regional supply capabilities to increase the share of components needed for manufacturing products for a particular region, as opposed to them being sourced from remote locations.\n\nRegular risk assessments are carried out at individual plant level, including the risks related to natural catastrophes and water scarcity. These assessments are also performed at locations of business-critical suppliers and of strategic inventories. Signify requires its sites to have robust business continuity plans for any large-scale events that can severely impact the business. These plans include sourcing from alternative suppliers, nearshoring, and increasing strategic inventories.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Moreover, early 2022, the company continued to see a volatile market with significant increases in the costs of (raw) materials and key components, putting further pressure on pricing to the final customers.\n\nThe high speed of innovation and the increasing importance of digital technology in the general lighting industry requires Signify to spend considerable resources on developing new products and solutions. It also requires developing different capabilities and competences to commercialize its innovations successfully. In particular, in the fast-changing market in which the company operates, it must continuously address the needs of local customers and introduce locally relevant new products and solutions ahead of competition.\n\nFailure to bring new products and solutions to the markets in a timely fashion and to commercialize its innovations successfully would lead to the expected benefits of these investments not being delivered and, hence, this would be detrimental to both the top and bottom line of the company.\n\nAs Signify becomes more digitalized, more devices and systems are connected online. This increases cyber security risk across enterprise IT, Operational Technology (OT) and our products and solutions that are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and accompanying (cloud-based) software applications.\n\nShould a successful cyber-attack materialize, the processes, services and systems that allow the organization to continue to operate could be impacted resulting in operational disruption, with or without ransom demands. Further, a cyber-attack could cause a data breach where sensitive, protected, personal or confidential data held by Signify is leaked or stolen.\n\nCost inflation due to the shortage of components, containers or labor is offset through a combination of cost savings and market price increases. The level of pricing moves is benchmarked versus key competitors.\n\nSignify invests significantly in its R&D activities. It has dedicated R&D activities to support its divisions in developing and realizing near-term innovation roadmaps, and to develop longer-term innovations with a focus on areas such as connected lighting systems, software and digital applications.\n\nSignify adapted its business structure to enable a stronger customer focus and enhanced specialization to further increase execution speed. Finally, dedicated go-to-market channels and tailored marketing approaches are in place with the aim to successfully introduce new offerings commercially.\n\nThe return on innovation investments is reviewed on a quarterly basis, including speed to market, efficiency of investment and sales development versus plan.\n\nSignify develops its products and software applications and secures the ecosystem in conformity to security standards and best practices (ISA/ IEC62443, ISO2700x, NIST).\n\nCyber risk is reviewed by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on a periodic basis. A dedicated cyber security team scans external developments, identifies inherent risks, and proposes plans to limit residual risk as much as possible. The Security Board aligns on the level of acceptable residual risk. Each year mandatory security and data protection & privacy awareness trainings are conducted. A security improvement roadmap has been created and the progress is monitored by the Security Board, Supervisory Board and Audit Risk Committee.\n\nSecurity measures are in place to detect attackers and to minimize the risk of them causing damage to systems and gaining access to critical data, systems and services. Business continuity plans are in place in the event of nonavailability of IT systems and manufacturing sites. These business continuity plans are tested periodically.\n\n<!-- image -->",

('the Company') and its subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 2:24b of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2022, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and with the statutory provisions of Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The Consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Board of Management of the Company and authorized for issue on February 28, 2023, and will be submitted for adoption to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 16, 2023. The Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, including derivatives (measured at fair value), assets held for sale (measured at the lower of carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell), and definedbenefit pension plans (plan assets are measured at fair value).\n\n## Functional and presentational currency\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements are presented in euros (EUR), which is the functional and presentation currency of Signify N.V. All amounts are presented in EUR million and have been rounded to the nearest EUR million, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding, amounts may not add up to totals provided.\n\n## Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. These estimates inherently contain a degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThese estimates and judgments are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current and expected future outcomes, third-party evaluations and various other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities, as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and\n\n<!-- image -->",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "contingencies. Signify revises material estimates if changes occur in the circumstances or there is new information or experience on which an estimate was or can be based.\n\nThe areas where the most significant judgments and estimates are made are goodwill, deferred tax asset recoverability, revenue recognition, impairments, provisions, insurance cover asset recoverability, employee benefit obligations, inventory valuation and obsolescence provision, estimation of loss allowance for expected credit losses, leases, fair value of derivatives, other financial instruments and assets and liabilities in business combinations. For further discussion on these significant judgments and estimates, reference is made to the respective accounting policies and notes within these Consolidated financial statements that relate to the above topics.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine war\n\nThe outbreak of the war in Ukraine impacted Signify's business in Russia and Ukraine. As a result of the war, Signify reported EUR 20 million of charges in the consolidated statement of income. The most significant items are further described as follows:\n\n## Inventories\n\nSignify reviewed the impact that the war has on its ability to control and sell inventories in the region. The analysis resulted in a write-down of inventories of EUR 3 million for the year.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nSignify reviewed the collectability of its trade accounts receivables and recorded EUR 7 million of impairment. The impairment was mainly due to the increased risk of uncollectible receivables.\n\n## Climate-related matters\n\nThe impact of climate change generates opportunities as well as challenges for Signify's existing and future lighting products and solutions portfolio. As the world leader in lighting, and an industry front runner in sustainability, Signify has fully integrated sustainability into its 5 Frontiers strategy, driving five growth areas to help address the world's greatest sustainability challenges: climate action, circular economy, food availability, safety & security, and health & well-being. As a result, Signify's portfolio is well-positioned to anticipate risks and opportunities related to climate change.\n\n## Digital Solutions and Digital Products\n\nDigital Solutions and Digital Products benefit from the phasing out of conventional lighting and the move to more energy-efficient LED and connected lighting. Stimulus packages, such as the EU Green Deal and the US stimulus package, are pushing for the use of more sustainable technologies. This creates a multi-year opportunity for Signify, as its product portfolio is wellpositioned to capture growth from this drive for sustainability.\n\n## Conventional Products\n\nThe conventional market is expected to continue to decline in the coming years due to the ongoing adoption of LED lighting technologies and legislation banning certain technologies. While the overall conventional market continues to decline, Conventional Products' focus is on winning market share in key segments and markets to remain market leader. This position supports the company's drive to lead the transition to connected LED products. The division continues to proactively manage its manufacturing footprint and reduce operational costs to optimize free cash flow.\n\nDevelopments on climate-related matters for the Division were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the key assumptions used in the annual goodwill impairment test for Conventional Products have taken into account external market assumptions, including potential phase out of products due to market conditions and legislation likely to be ratified. In the 2022 annual goodwill test, the estimated recoverable amount of Conventional Products exceeded its carrying value, therefore no impairment loss was recognized. For further details, refer to note 15, Intangible assets.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe current macro economic environment poses challenges which are closely monitored by Signify. Key challenges include: supply chain disruptions, increase of interest rates, business climate uncertainties and COVID-19 related lockdowns. The key areas impacted by these challenges are further described below.\n\n## Supply chain disruptions\n\nIn response to the global supply chain disruptions, Signify has been implementing several mitigating actions. As a result of these actions, the availability of components has improved. However, the supply chain was still affected by longer supplier lead times, which in turn impacted Signify's inventory levels. For further details on Signify's inventories, refer to note 17, Inventories.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter did not result in an impairment loss being recognized. The key assumptions of the goodwill impairment test include sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. All key assumptions were updated to reflect management's current best estimates, including the recovery of the global lighting market from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. For further details, refer to note 15, Intangible assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Intangible assets, other than goodwill\n\nSignify monitors changes in the economic environment which could indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, and performs an impairment test when an impairment trigger is identified. No impairment was identified based on procedures performed.\n\n## Assumptions for post-employment benefits\n\nMacroeconomic developments impacted underlying assumptions of post-employment liabilities such as the interest rates and investment performance. Signify performed an updated quantification of the net defined benefit liability as at December 31, 2022, based on the most recent assumptions. Details of the underlying assumptions used can be found in note 25, Postemployment benefits.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nIn the context of macroeconomic developments, Signify has also assessed whether it is still probable that deferred tax assets recognized on the balance sheet will be realized. No derecognition as a result of this assessment was recorded.\n\n## Changes in accounting policy\n\n## New and amended standards adopted\n\nSignify has applied the following amendments for the first time to its annual reporting period commencing January 1, 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework.\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract.\n- \u00b7 Annual improvements to IFRS 2018-2020.\n\nSignify changed its accounting policies in accordance with the amendments listed above. The changes did not have any significant impact on the amounts recognized in the prior period and current period.\n\n## New and amended standards not yet adopted\n\nSeveral new standards or amendments to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for reporting periods commencing on or after January 1, 2023. These standards have not been adopted early by Signify. The new standards or amendments are not expected to have a material impact on Signify in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions.\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## General\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied by Signify to all periods presented in these Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Signify N.V. and all subsidiaries it controls (i.e. when it is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee). The existence and effect of potential voting rights are considered when assessing whether the Company controls another entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Under the acquisition method, the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recognized at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to Signify. Signify measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:\n\n- \u00b7 The fair value of the consideration transferred plus.\n- \u00b7 The recognized amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree plus.\n- \u00b7 If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree less.\n- \u00b7 The net recognized amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\nCosts related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nSignify's investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. Investments in associates are those entities in which Signify has significant influence, but no control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Signify entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ('the functional currency').\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation when items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income, except when deferred in Other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges. The exchange differences are presented as part of Cost of sales, except for tax items and Financial income and expense, which are recognized in the same line item as they relate to.\n\nUpon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of non-euro entities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments at the time of the acquisition, are translated into euros at the year-end rates of exchange. The items of the statement of income of foreign activities are translated at the rates which are approximating the rates at the dates of transactions. The resulting translation differences of the net investments in foreign operations are recognized in Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the goods. For standard sale of products, control generally passes to the customer when the product is delivered and accepted, depending on the delivery conditions and incoterms. For products for which a right to return exists during a defined period, revenue is recognized by considering the historical pattern of actual returns. Return policies are typically based on customary return arrangements in local markets.\n\n## Sale of services\n\nSignify accounts for cloud-enabled services, extended warranties and lifecycle services as separate performance obligations. Control over these services is transferred over time and revenue is recognized, in most cases, on a straight-line basis over the duration of the service period.\n\n## Transaction price\n\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which Signify expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The transaction price excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties, such as sales taxes.\n\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the total consideration of the contract is allocated to all distinct performance obligations in the contract based on their stand-alone selling prices. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on other stand-alone sales transactions that are directly observable, when possible. However, observable prices are not\n\navailable for all performance obligations. If no direct observable prices are available, the standalone selling price is normally based on the expected cost plus a margin approach.\n\nThe transaction price may be variable due to discounts, rebates or similar arrangements. Revenue is only recognized for the part of the consideration for which it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Judgment is required in determining the probability and level of discounts and rebates that will be granted. The estimate is updated throughout the term of the contract.\n\nSignify does not adjust the transaction price for the effects of significant financing component if, at contract inception, it is expected that the period between customer payment and the transfer of goods or services is one year or less. This applies to most sales transactions.\n\n## Other\n\nPayments made to customers for distinct goods or services are excluded from revenue recognized and recorded as part of Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\nSignify may incur costs for obtaining a contract, including payments made to agents that depend on winning the contract. Signify applies the practical expedient from IFRS 15, allowing the incremental costs of obtaining a contract to be expensed if the associated amortization period is 12 months or less. As a result, no amounts of contract costs are recognized in the balance sheet.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\nContract assets mostly comprise of unbilled positions, where Signify has, partially or in full, satisfied performance obligations but not yet billed the customer. These are recorded under either Other current assets or Other non-current assets. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the rights become unconditional, which is mostly when the customer is billed.\n\nContract liabilities consist of deferred income and payments received in advance and are recorded under Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities. Deferred income includes balances related to extended warranty, life-cycle services as well as other services such as cloud-enabled services. Advances from customers mostly comprises payments received in advance for projects, for which Signify still needs to satisfy (part of) the performance obligations.\n\n## Income and expenses\n\nSignify applies accrual accounting. This means that expenses are recognized when incurred and Income is recognized when earned, irrespective of the actual cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Consideration received from customers for shipping and handling is recognized as Sales. Shipping and handling expenses related to sales to third parties are generally recorded as Selling, general and administrative expenses. When shipping and handling are distinct performance obligations, then the related expenses are recorded as Cost of sales.\n\nAdvertising and promotion costs and costs related to the brand license fee are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The costs of conversion of inventories include direct labor and fixed and variable production overheads, considering the stage of completion and the normal capacity of production facilities. Costs of idle facility and abnormal waste are expensed. The cost of inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Due to price erosion and technological developments, inventory valuation requires forward-looking estimates on future sales levels, future price erosion and related expected gross margin percentages. On each reporting date, management performs an analysis of net realizable values and determines the lower of cost and net realizable value to measure its inventories. The write-down is included in Cost of sales.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Recognition\n\nA financial asset or liability is recognized when Signify becomes party to a contract that is a financial instrument. Regular way purchases and sales of financial instruments are accounted for at the trade date. Initial measurement of financial assets and liabilities is at fair value. Dividend income is recognized when declared.\n\nFinancial assets arising from insurance contracts are only recognized when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if Signify settles the obligation. Signify recognizes the reimbursement as a separate financial asset.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nThe classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets and liabilities depends on Signify's business model for managing the financial assets and liabilities, the contractual terms of the cash flows and the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test. Signify performs the analysis on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Financial assets and liabilities are classified into one of the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at amortized cost: The business model for these instruments is to hold them to collect contractual cash flows. This financial asset category mainly consists of Trade and other receivables. After initial recognition these financial assets are measured at amortized\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance and net of discounts given or agreed to, if the offset requirements are met.\n\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): The business model for these instruments is to hold them for trading. This financial asset category mainly consists of Signify's participations in Virtual Power Purchase Agreements and other Derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): The business model for these instruments is to hold them to collect contractual cash flows and to sell them. Fair value gains and losses are subsequently not reclassified to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. This category consists of minor equity investments.\n- \u00b7 All financial liabilities except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost. This financial liability category primarily consists of Debt and Trade and other payables. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss mainly consists of Derivatives and Contingent consideration in a business acquisition, to which IFRS 3 applies. Contingent consideration is subsequently measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nSignify presents financial assets and financial liabilities on a gross basis as separate line items in the Consolidated statement of financial position, unless the offset criteria are met.\n\nThe offsetting criteria are met if Signify has a legal right to offset financial assets with financial liabilities and if Signify intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. To meet the requirement, the right of set-off should be available today and not contingent on a future event and it should be legally enforceable for all counterparties in a normal course of business, as well as in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognized when:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or\n- \u00b7 Signify has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and either (a) Signify has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nWhen Signify has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, Signify continues to recognize the transferred asset to the extent of its continuing involvement. In that case, Signify also recognizes an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that Signify has retained.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets\n\nSignify estimates lifetime expected loss allowance for all Trade receivables and Contract assets via calculating the expected credit losses. Trade receivables and contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due whereby the lifetime expected credit loss on the Trade receivables is recognized based on a matrix model calculated per country, which utilizes historical recoverability data and default probability per country.\n\nAs soon as individual trade accounts receivable can no longer be collected in a normal course of business and are expected to result in a loss, they are designated as doubtful trade accounts receivable and valued at the expected collectible amounts. They are written off when they are deemed to be uncollectable because of bankruptcy or other form of receivership at the debtors. Any previously recognized expected loss is offset against the carrying amount of such trade receivable and the difference is taken as a loss accounted for within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Impairment of other financial assets\n\nSignify assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated with its debt instruments carried at amortized cost. Signify determines impairment amount based on the three stages of credit risk deterioration. The criteria to pass on to the next stage of the credit deterioration is established for individual financial assets or group of financial assets with similar characteristics, considering credit risk profile of the counterparty, historical default data and macroeconomic factors.\n\n## Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nAt inception of the hedge relationship, Signify documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. Signify documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions.\n\nFor foreign currency forwards, Signify designates the spot component of the change in fair value in cash flow hedge relationships. The spot component is determined with reference to the relevant spot market exchange rates. The differential between the contracted forward rate and the spot market exchange rate is defined as forward points. It is discounted, where material. Changes in the fair value related to forward points are continuously recognized in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nTranslation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is generally not hedged. However, if a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment hedge. Signify designates the full instrument in the hedge relationship. The result of hedging of the translation risk, using net investment hedges is recognized in the Currency translation differences within equity, as can be seen in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income as long as the hedge is effective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignify measures all derivative financial instruments at fair value derived from market prices of the instruments or calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. These calculations are tested for reasonableness by comparing the outcome of the internal valuation with the valuation received from the counterparty.\n\nSignify monitors that the economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and hedge ratio is the same as the one Signify uses for the risk management purposes. A prospective effectiveness test is performed to prove that the hedge is effective. For the prospective effectiveness test, Signify utilizes the dollar offset method.\n\nIf the hedge ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal due to the different timing or amount of the underlying transaction, but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge continues to qualify for hedge accounting, Signify performs re-balancing of the hedge relationship by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or the volume of the hedged item, so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for the risk management purposes. Gains and losses that were accumulated in equity related to an ineffective portion of hedge, Signify records immediately in the Consolidated statement of income when such ineffectiveness occurs.\n\nThe derivatives related to transactions are, for hedge accounting purposes, split into hedges of on-balance-sheet accounts receivable/payable and forecasted sales and purchases. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivatives are recognized within the Cost of sales in the Consolidated statement of income, except for derivatives that are effective and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which are recorded in Other comprehensive income until the Consolidated statement of income is affected by the variability in cash flows of the designated hedged item. Changes in the fair value of hedges related to intercompany loans and deposits are recognized within Financial income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe derivatives used by Signify can be subject to master netting and set-off agreements with financial counterparties. In case of certain termination events, under the terms of these Master Agreements, Signify can terminate the outstanding transactions and aggregate their positive and negative values to arrive at a single net termination sum (or close-out amount). This contractual right is, among others, subject to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The right may be limited by local law if the counterparty is subject to bankruptcy proceedings.\n- \u00b7 The right applies on a bilateral basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Income tax is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly within equity or in Other comprehensive income. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially-enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized, using the balance sheet method, for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they probably will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities for withholding taxes are recognized for subsidiaries in situations where the income is to be paid out as dividend in the foreseeable future and for undistributed earnings of unconsolidated companies to the extent that these withholding taxes are not expected to be refundable or deductible.\n\nChanges in tax rates are reflected in the period when the change has been enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognized for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. The evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires judgment about the future taxable profitability of the legal entity holding the tax loss carry forward. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the countries where the deferred tax assets originated and during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning\n\nstrategies in making this assessment. A lack of future taxable profits or taxable profits below the level of current estimates, may cause deferred tax assets to be impaired.\n\nThe ultimate tax effects of transactions may be uncertain for a considerable period of time, requiring management to estimate the related current and deferred tax treatments. In assessing the uncertainty, Signify considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept or revise the uncertain tax treatment. Income tax payable include liabilities for uncertain tax positions which are recognized when it is probable that tax will be due. To the extent uncertain tax positions relate to deferred tax assets these are offset against each other. Actual tax assessments in relation to these uncertain tax positions may significantly deviate from estimates.\n\nIn determining the amount of current and deferred income tax, Signify takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgments about future events. New information may become available that causes Signify to change its judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities; such changes to tax liabilities will impact the income tax expense in the period that such a determination is made.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized if, as a result of a past event, Signify has a present legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of time value of money. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. Significant judgment is required in determining the amount and probability of resources outflow and discount rates used to calculate the present value of this outflow. A liability is recognized if timing and amount of the settlement can be reliably estimated.\n\nThe accounting and presentation for some of Signify's provisions is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring related provisions - The provision for restructuring relates to the estimated costs of programs that are planned and controlled by management that materially change the scope of our business or the manner in which it is conducted. A provision is recognized when Signify has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation that Signify will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan, or by announcing the plan's main features to those affected by it.\n- \u00b7 Environmental provisions - Measurement of liabilities associated with environmental obligations is based on current legal and constructive requirements. Liabilities and expected insurance recoveries, if any, are recorded separately. The carrying amount of environmental provisions is regularly reviewed and adjusted for new facts and changes in law.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Product warranty - A provision for product warranty is made at the time of revenue recognition and reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to the products. The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighing of possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.\n- \u00b7 Litigation provisions - In relation to legal claim provisions and settlements, the relevant balances are transferred to Other liabilities at the point the amount and timing of cash flows are no longer uncertain. Settlements which are agreed for amounts in excess of existing provisions are reflected as payables.\n- \u00b7 Onerous contract provisions - Provisions are recognized for a contract if it is onerous. The present obligation under the contract is measured and recognized as a provision. An onerous contract is a contract under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWhen the potential cash outflow is possible or remote and the risk covered by a guarantee is not a financial risk, Signify applies off-balance sheet treatment to such guarantees. For example, environmental remediation and legal proceedings. When the expectation of the cash outflow becomes probable such guarantees become provisions, see guidance above.\n\nWhen guarantees are covering credit risk or any other financial risk they are accounted for as financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Leases\n\nSignify entered into contracts that conveys the right to use the identified asset and as such Signify accounted for these contracts as a lessee.\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nSignify recognizes right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless Signify is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nAt the commencement date of the lease, Signify recognizes lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in-substance) fixed payments (less any lease incentives), variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by Signify and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects Signify exercising the option to terminate. In calculating the present value of lease payments, Signify uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nSignify applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases for real estate (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to leases of office equipment that are considered of low value. Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Significant judgment in determining the lease term of contracts with renewal options\n\nSignify determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. When determining the lease term, Signify considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. These circumstances include Signify's strategic plans, the industrial footprint of Signify and divisions and the importance of the site to Signify's operations.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe measurement of goodwill at initial recognition is described under accounting policy, Business combinations, above. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of investments in associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and an impairment loss on such investment is allocated to the investment as a whole.\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nThe fair value of other intangible assets, mainly customer relations, brand names and technology based intangibles acquired through business combinations is determined using a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of an asset based on market participants' expectations of the cash flows associated with that asset over its remaining useful life. Acquired finite-lived\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The useful lives are evaluated annually. Intangible assets are initially capitalized at cost, with the exception of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination that are capitalized at their acquisition-date fair value.\n\nExpenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalized as an intangible asset if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, cost can be reliably measured, Signify has sufficient resources and the intention to complete development.\n\nThe development expenditure capitalized comprises all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Other development expenditures and expenditures on research activities are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income. Capitalized development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. Amortization of capitalized development expenditure is charged to the Consolidated statement of income on a straight- line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets in Research and development expenses.\n\nAmortization of other intangible assets is reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses for brand names and customer relationships and in Cost of sales for technologybased and other intangible assets.\n\nThe expected useful lives in years of intangible assets excluding goodwill are as follows:\n\n| Product development   | from 2 to 5   |\n|-----------------------|---------------|\n| Software              | from 1 to 10  |\n| Technology            | from 1 to 20  |\n| Customer relations    | from 5 to 20  |\n| Brand names           | from 5 to 20  |\n| Other                 | from 2 to 10  |\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use are not amortized but tested for impairment annually and whenever impairment indicators require impairment testing. Signify performed and completed annual impairment tests in the last quarter of the financial year. Judgment is required when analyzing impairments triggers and tests of goodwill and intangible assets not yet ready for use. These analyses are based on the estimation of the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized in the Consolidated statement of income whenever and to the extent that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit exceeds the unit's recoverable amount, which is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use or fair value less costs of disposal is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset via its use or sale with deduction of costs directly associated with its use or sale.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred tax assets\n\nNon-financial assets other than goodwill, intangible assets not yet ready for use, inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is assessed by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is measured as the present value of future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset is deemed not recoverable, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the recoverable amount. The review for impairment is carried out at the level where cash flows occur that are independent of other cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses recognized in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if and to the extent there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized. Reversals of impairment are recognized in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Pension and other employee benefits\n\n## Defined-benefit plans\n\nSignify's retirement benefit obligation is calculated by an independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method. This calculation is performed separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the benefit that employees have earned in relation to their past services. The measurement date for all defined benefit plans is December 31. For plans with a relatively low defined-benefit obligation, Signify may decide to calculate the defined-benefit obligation with a lower frequency. The liability recognized in the Consolidated statement of financial position is the present value of these benefits at the end of the reporting period (defined-benefit obligation) less the fair value of plan assets. The defined-benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows using a discount yield curve of highquality corporate bonds with durations matching the terms of the benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The increase in the defined-benefit obligation due to the passage of time and the expected return on plan assets, using the same interest rate as for the defined-benefit obligation, are included in the pension costs. Interest on the net defined-benefit obligation is recognized in Financing income and expenses in the Consolidated statement of income.\n\nPast-service costs are recognized immediately in the Personnel costs in the Consolidated statement of income. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity via other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.\n\nWhen a plan is changed, settled or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in the definedbenefit obligation that relates to past-service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in the Consolidated statement of income. Signify recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\nSignify presents all net defined-benefit post-employment obligations on one line within noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Defined-contribution plans\n\nContributions to defined-contribution plans are recognized in the Consolidated income statement in Personnel expenses as incurred.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by Signify before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. Signify recognizes termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to a termination and when they have a detailed formal plan to terminate the employment of current employees without possibility of withdrawal.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSignify's net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such as jubilee entitlements. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognized in the Consolidated statement of income in the period in which they arise.\n\nShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis. Signify recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and incentives based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit attributable to Signify's shareholders after certain adjustments.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. Bank overdrafts form an integral part of Signify's cash management and often fluctuate from being positive to overdrawn and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets (disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale. Non-current assets held for sale are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Comparatives in the balance sheet are not changed when a non-current asset is classified as held-for-sale.\n\n## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nWhen the economy of a country in which Signify operates is deemed hyperinflationary and the functional currency of a Signify entity is the currency of that hyperinflationary economy, the financial statements of such entity are adjusted so that they are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. This involves adjustment of historical cost in purchasing power caused by inflation from the date of initial recognition to the balance sheet date. The hyperinflation adjustment is recognized directly in equity. Comparative amounts are not adjusted.\n\n## Equity\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of shares are recognized as a deduction from equity. Dividends are recognized as a liability in the period in which they are declared. The income tax consequences of dividends are recognized when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\nTreasury shares that are reacquired are recognized at cost, representing the market price on the acquisition date, and deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. When reissued, shares are removed from treasury shares on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. When treasury shares are delivered under Signify's share plans, the difference between the market price of the shares delivered and the cost is recorded in retained earnings, the market price is recorded in share premium. Upon cancellation, treasury shares are deducted from the share capital at their nominal value of EUR 0.01 per share and retained earnings for the difference.\n\nCosts including dividend withholding tax in connection with Signify's purchase of treasury shares for capital reduction purposes are recorded in retained earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives and residual values are evaluated annually. The costs of property, plant and equipment comprise of all directly attributable costs (including the cost of materials and direct labor). Government grants for assets are deducted from the cost of the related asset.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, is calculated using the straight-line method taking into account the residual values and estimated useful lives and is primarily included in Cost of sales. Freehold land is not depreciated. Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are included in Other business income. Costs related to repair and maintenance activities are expensed in the period in which they are incurred unless leading to an extension of the original lifetime of capacity.\n\nThe expected useful lives in years of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\n\n| Building                    | from 5 to 50   |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|\n| Machinery and installations | from 3 to 20   |\n| Other equipment             | from 1 to 10   |\n| Right-of-use assets         | from 2 to 20   |\n\n## Share-based compensation expenses\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions is determined by the fair value at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\nThe grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as personnel expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the award. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit in the statement of profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.\n\nService and non-market performance conditions are not considered when determining the grant date fair value of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of Signify's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected within the grant date fair value.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or service conditions have not been met. Where awards include a market or non-vesting condition, the transactions are treated as vested irrespective of whether the\n\nmarket or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\n## Consolidated statement of cash flows\n\nThe Consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are accounted for as cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. Cash flows from other derivative instruments are classified consistent with the nature of the instrument. Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated into euros using the exchange rate at the date of the cash flow. Borrowings which are repaid within the quarter, with a maturity of less than three months, are reported on a net basis in cash flows from financing activities.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nSignify presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V. by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprises of restricted shares, conditional shares and performance shares granted to employees.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGrants from the government are recognized at their fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and Signify will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants relating to costs are deferred and recognized in the Consolidated statement of income over the period necessary to match them with the costs that they are intended to compensate.\n\n## 3 Information by segment and main country\n\nOperating segments are components of Signify's business activities about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Board of Management of Signify). The operating segments are Digital Solutions, Digital Products and Conventional Products. The segments are organized based on the nature of the products and services. 'Other' represents amounts not allocated to the operating segments and includes certain costs related to central R&D activities to drive innovation as well as group enabling functions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These uncertainties include, among others, the following:\n\n## Transfer pricing uncertainties\n\nSignify has issued transfer pricing directives, which are in accordance with international guidelines, such as those of the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As transfer pricing has a cross-border effect, potential adjustments by local tax authorities on implemented transfer pricing procedures in a country may have an impact on results in another country. In order to reduce the transfer pricing uncertainties, monitoring procedures are carried out by Group Tax and Internal Audit to safeguard the correct implementation of the transfer pricing directives.\n\n## Global tax developments\n\nSignify notes developments in relation to the OECD inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Recently, EU member states reached agreement in principle to implement at EU level a 15% global minimum tax (so-called 'Pillar Two') to be transposed into member states' national law by the end of 2023. The other OECD member states must also enact domestic legislation implementing the OECD's proposed rules for them to become law. It is too early to assess the overall impact of these potential changes, as these and other tax laws and related regulations are yet to be enacted, revised, and implemented.\n\n## Tax uncertainties on general and specific service agreements and licensing agreements\n\nDue to the centralization of certain activities in a limited number of countries (such as research and development, IT, group functions and head office), costs are also centralized. Consequently, these costs and/or revenues must be allocated to the beneficiaries, i.e. the various Signify entities. This could lead to discussions with local tax authorities if they do not accept these charges. For that purpose, service contracts such as intra-group service agreements and licensing agreements are signed with Signify group entities. Tax authorities review these intra-group service and licensing agreements and may reject the implemented intra-group charges.\n\n## Tax uncertainties due to permanent establishments\n\nSignify may encounter tax uncertainties because of potential permanent establishments in countries where new operations are started or business models are altered. This could happen when operations in a country involve a foreign Signify organization. There is a risk that tax claims could arise on these operations in both countries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nWhen Signify has cross-border operations, there is a risk that tax claims will arise in all relevant countries.\n\nAssessing the amount of tax liabilities for these tax uncertainties is highly judgmental and the timing of possible outflows, if any, is uncertain. Signify has considered the merits of its filing position in its overall evaluation of potential tax liabilities and believes it has adequate tax liabilities recorded in its consolidated financial statements for exposures on these matters. Based on its evaluation of the potential tax liabilities and the merits of Signify's filing positions, it is unlikely that potential tax exposures over the amounts currently recorded as liabilities in its Consolidated financial statements will be material to its financial condition or future results of operations.\n\nWith regard to the uncertainties, an income tax payable is recognized when it is probable that additional taxes will be due. In addition, related to similar uncertainties, an indemnification liability to Koninklijke Philips N.V. of EUR 16 million (2021: EUR 52 million) and an indemnification receivable of EUR 5 million (2021: EUR 10 million) is recorded. The total net indemnification liability decreased in 2022 by EUR 31 million mainly due to settlements and expirations.\n\nTax uncertainties also include exposures with a risk assessment which are deemed lower than probable, but possible. The best estimate of the maximum amount in connection with these uncertainties is EUR 77 million. Signify believes that in connection with these uncertainties it is probable that no additional taxes will be due. Therefore, no income tax payable is recognized.\n\n## 10 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                                                       | 2021        | 2022        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Net income attributable to shareholders of Signify N.V.                                                               | 397         | 523         |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding  (after deduction of treasury shares) during the year          | 124,966,505 | 125,004,312 |\n| Plus incremental shares assumed from conversions of:                                                                  |             |             |\n| \u00b7 Performance shares                                                                                                  | 2,828,996   | 1,904,807   |\n| \u00b7 Conditional shares                                                                                                  | 710,721     | 599,885     |\n| \u00b7 Restricted shares                                                                                                   | 139,716     | 87,966      |\n| Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares  outstanding (after deduction of treasury shares) during the  year | 128,645,938 | 127,596,971 |\n| in EUR                                                                                                                |             |             |\n| \u00b7 Basic                                                                                                               | 3.18        | 4.18        |\n| \u00b7 Diluted                                                                                                             | 3.09        | 4.10        |\n\n## 11 Acquisitions and divestments\n\nSignify completed two acquisitions in 2022.\n\n## Acquisition of Fluence\n\nOn May 2, 2022, Signify completed the acquisition of 100% interest in Fluence Bioengineering, Inc (Fluence) and the purchase of certain related assets for a total consideration of EUR 257 million. The initial consideration was paid in cash. The transaction price did not include any contingent and/or deferred considerations. The overall cash position of Fluence on the transaction date was EUR 3 million.\n\nFluence is based in Austin, TX, United States and is a provider of agricultural lighting. The acquisition added Fluence's complementary technology and market segments to Signify's existing horticultural lighting operations and provided Signify with access to Fluence's strong multi-channel go-to-market approach in the attractive North American horticultural lighting market. As of May 2, 2022, Fluence was fully consolidated as part of Division Digital Solutions.\n\nAcquisition-related transaction costs that were recognized in General and administrative expenses in 2021 and 2022 amounted to EUR 3 million, of which EUR 1 million relates to 2022.\n\nThe condensed balance sheet of Fluence at the acquisition date was as follows:\n\n|                               | At acquisition  date   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Goodwill                      | 258                    |\n| Other intangible assets       | 20                     |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 3                      |\n| Net deferred tax              | 15                     |\n| Trade and other receivables   | 10                     |\n| Inventories                   | 30                     |\n| Other assets                  | 3                      |\n| Cash                          | 3                      |\n| Trade and other payables      | (20)                   |\n| Other liabilities             | (64)                   |\n| Net assets acquired           | 257                    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The fair value of assets and liabilities at acquisition date is provisional subject to final purchase price adjustments and closing settlement procedures, which will be finalized in early Q2, 2023. The opening balance positions subject to change are mainly related to the valuation of certain liabilities and goodwill where accounting of the fair value assumed is still preliminary. Receivables and other current assets are assumed to be valued against their fair value. Other intangible assets acquired of EUR 20 million relate mainly to Brand names.\n\nGoodwill recognized for the amount of EUR 258 million is primarily attributable to the growth of both the bio-based and horticulture markets and in addition, the future expansion plans for Fluence. The expansion plans are mainly driven by the changing regulatory environment in the United States and Europe. Goodwill is also attributable to the synergies expected to be achieved from integrating Fluence within Division Digital Solutions. The goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nFrom the acquisition date, the contribution of Fluence to the sales and net income of the Company was not material. If the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2022, sales and net income for the Company are considered not material for the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Acquisition of Pierlite\n\nOn April 29, 2022, Signify completed the acquisition of Pierlite, strengthening its position in the Australian and New Zealand lighting markets. The acquisition involved a total consideration of EUR 43 million, resulting in EUR 22 million goodwill and EUR 17 million intangible assets. Pierlite is consolidated within Division Digital Solutions. The acquisition is considered not material to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThere were no divestments in 2022.\n\n## 12 Interests in entities\n\n## Interests in subsidiaries\n\nThe Consolidated financial statements comprise the assets and liabilities of approximately 150 legal entities. Set out below is a list of material subsidiaries, in alphabetical order, representing more than 5% of either the consolidated company sales, income from operations or net income (before any intra-company eliminations). All the entities are 100% owned.\n\n| Legal entity name                    | Principal country of business   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Cooper Lighting Netherlands B.V.     | Netherlands                     |\n| Cooper Lighting, LLC                 | United States of America        |\n| Signify (China) Investment Co., Ltd. | China                           |\n| Signify France                       | France                          |\n| Signify GmbH                         | Germany                         |\n| Signify Holding B.V.                 | Netherlands                     |\n| Signify Netherlands B.V.             | Netherlands                     |\n| Signify North America Corporation    | United States of America        |\n| Signify Poland Sp. z.o.o.            | Poland                          |\n\nSignify does not have subsidiaries that have non-controlling interests that are material for its Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nSignify has investments in several associates, none of them are regarded as individually material.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, translation difference of EUR 117 million was mainly due to the change in the USD/EUR rate, which impacted the goodwill denominated in USD. Goodwill related to the acquisition of Fluence and Pierlite was EUR 258 million and EUR 22 million respectively, and was recognized in Digital Solutions.\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, which represent the lowest level at which the goodwill is monitored internally for management purposes. The cashgenerating units correspond to the operating segments.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit Digital Solutions is considered to be significant in comparison to the total book value of goodwill of Signify at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022. The goodwill allocated to each of the cash-generating units as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2022, is presented below.\n\n|                       | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Digital Solutions     | 2,089  | 2,482  |\n| Digital Products      | 315    | 317    |\n| Conventional Products | 59     | 63     |\n| Book value            | 2,464  | 2,861  |\n\nThe basis of the recoverable amount used of the cash-generating units is the value in use. In the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated recoverable amount of the cash-generating units tested, exceeded the carrying value of the units. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized.\n\nKey assumptions used in the impairment tests for the units were sales growth rates, EBITA and the rates used for discounting the projected cash flows. These cash flow projections cover an initial period with specific estimates from 2023 to 2025. Projections were extrapolated with declining growth rates for a period of five years, after which a terminal value was calculated. The sales growth rates and EBITA used to estimate cash flows are based on past performance, external market growth assumptions, taking into account current market conditions, and industry long-term growth averages. The applied discount rates are determined based on the weighted average cost of capital which reflects the risks relevant to the cash-generating units.\n\nCash flow projections for the impairment tests in 2022 and 2021 were based on the key assumptions included in the table below:\n\n## Key assumptions in %\n\n|                        | Compound sales growth rate  1   | Compound sales growth rate  1      | Compound sales growth rate  1   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                        | Extra polation  period          | Used to  calculate  terminal value | Pre-tax  discount rates         |\n| Digital Solutions 2022 | 2.8                             | 0.3                                | 11.6                            |\n| Digital Solutions 2021 | 2.6                             | 0.3                                | 11.0                            |\n\nGiven the weaker external environment, the impairment test of Q4 2022 assumes a lower growth expectation in 2023 compared to previous year, with a gradual recovery in 2024. Signify performed a sensitivity analysis and noted that a reasonably possible change in key assumptions will not result in an impairment.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nThe additions for 2022 contain internally generated assets of EUR 37 million for product development and EUR 16 million for software. In 2022, acquired other intangible assets are customer relationships of EUR 15 million and brand names of EUR 22 million which relates to Fluence and Pierlite acquisition in Q2 2022.\n\nThe capitalized product development costs and software, for which amortization has not yet commenced, amounted to EUR 50 million as of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021: EUR 27 million).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Genlyte acquisition in 2007 was EUR 2 million (USD 2 million) with a remaining amortization period of 0.1 years (2021: EUR 37 million, USD 42 million; 1.1 years). The carrying amount of the customer relationships originating from the Cooper Lighting acquisition in 2022 was EUR 276 million (USD 294 million) with a remaining amortization period of 17.8 years (2021: EUR 288 million, USD 326 million; 18.8 years).\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, the undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) of EUR 500 million is maturing in January 2027.\n\nThe EUR term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on the relevant applicable EURIBOR plus a fixed margin of 0.15%. The USD term loan bears interest at a variable rate based on the relevant applicable USD LIBOR with zero floor plus a margin. As of December 31, 2022, the margin on the USD term loan was 0.75% and is subject to change, depending on the public credit rating of Signify assigned by rating agencies.\n\nThe term loans and RCF agreement include a financial covenant providing that Signify maintains a net leverage ratio of no greater than 3.5x. The net leverage ratio may temporarily increase to 4.0x within 12 months of the closing of material acquisitions. The covenant does not apply if Signify has at least one investment grade rating, which is currently the case, as Signify has two investment grade ratings.\n\n## Eurobonds\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Signify had outstanding EUR 675 million of fixed rate notes due in May 2024 with an annual coupon of 2.000% and EUR 600 million of fixed rate notes due in May 2027 with an annual coupon of 2.375%.\n\n## Other debt\n\nOther debt includes short term borrowings which Signify repays ultimately within one year. Borrowings which are drawn and repaid within the same quarter, with a maturity of less than three months, are reported on a net basis in the movement of other debt. These borrowings were taken to manage intra month and intra quarter working capital requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As at December 31, 2022, the provision includes the restructuring of the central organization, programs of Conventional Products in Belgium and other restructuring programs. Signify expects the provision will be utilized mainly within the next year.\n\n## Environmental provision\n\nSignify is exposed to environment risks, mainly because it has been in the business of manufacturing products for more than a century. During that period, Signify has opened, discontinued and acquired many manufacturing plants and sites. Some of these plants and sites have been used for industrial purposes for decades and as such, there is a latent risk that these premises may have environmental conditions that require corrective actions as a result of such use. The environmental provisions include accrued costs recorded with respect to environmental remediation in various countries. Provisions for environmental remediation can change significantly due to the emergence of additional information regarding the extent or nature of the contamination, the need to utilize alternative technologies, actions by regulatory authorities as well as changes in judgments and discount rates. The environmental provision is expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## Product warranty\n\nManufacturing of Signify's products involves complex processes and defects might occur. In addition, it is possible that some of Signify's products may not perform as expected (for example, in terms of estimated life span and projected energy savings). These defects or shortfalls may cause Signify to incur significant warranty, support and replacement costs. The provision for product warranty reflects the estimated costs of replacement and free-of-charge services that will be incurred by Signify with respect to products sold. Signify expects the provision will be mainly utilized within the next two years.\n\n## Legal\n\nSignify and certain of its group companies are involved in legal proceedings relating to such matters as product liability and claims for property damage and personal injury, alleged to have been caused by failure or malfunction of its products as well as commercial transactions, and intellectual property infringements (among others). The outcome of asserted claims and proceedings, or the impact of any claims that may be asserted in the future, cannot be predicted with certainty. Signify makes provisions if payments with respect to such matters are probable and the amount can be estimated reliably. Signify expects the provision will be mainly utilized within the next three years.\n\nOn October 5, 2022, a jury in trial court in Connecticut awarded compensation of USD 90 million in a lawsuit against Signify relating to a workplace accident that occurred in September 2017 in a\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signify categorically disagrees with the jury's findings, which it believes are not supported by either the facts or the law. There has been no judgment issued by the trial court confirming this verdict and Signify will exercise all its rights to contest any improper verdict issued in this case.\n\nSignify has a comprehensive global liability insurance and has received confirmation that the case is fully covered without reservation of rights, including interest and other costs. As a result, both the amount awarded and insurance cover were recognized without any net profit and loss impact. Since there was no net impact to profit and loss,this addition to legal provision and the corresponding movement in non-current financial assets were not presented as adjustments in the consolidated statement of cash flows. In the table above the liability for the amount awarded by the jury, (although not yet confirmed by the court) has been included as an addition to the legal provision. The insurance cover asset has been recognized as part of noncurrent financial assets.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions mainly comprise of provisions for self-insurance, decommissioning and provision for employee jubilee funds. Other provisions are expected to be utilized mainly within the next five years.\n\n## 25 Post-employment benefits\n\nPost-employment benefits covered in this note relate to defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, including defined-benefit retiree medical plans. The benefits provided by these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation levels. Employee post-employment defined-benefit plans have been established in several countries in accordance with the legal requirements, customs and local practice.\n\n## Net defined-benefit liabilities per country\n\n|                 | 2021       | 2021         | 2021           | 2022       | 2022         | 2022           |\n|-----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------------|----------------|\n|                 | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net  Liability | Obligation | Plan  assets | Net  Liability |\n| Unites States   | 563        | (475)        | 88             | 459        | (351)        | 108            |\n| Germany         | 208        | (15)         | 193            | 170        | (15)         | 155            |\n| Other countries | 133        | (51)         | 82             | 112        | (48)         | 64             |\n| Total countries | 904        | (541)        | 363            | 741        | (414)        | 327            |\n\n## United States\n\nThe defined-benefit Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan in the US covers certain hourly workers and salaried workers hired before January 1, 2005 and has a net liability of EUR 47 million. The plan is closed for new entrants and since 2016 no further benefit accruals are taking place. Employees only accrue benefits in a defined-contribution plan. Signify pays the administration cost and contributions to cover the funding deficit of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan. The plan assets are governed by an Investment Committee. Signify also has an unfunded pension plan in place for higher salaried employees with a net liability of EUR 16 million and a post-retirement welfare plan with a net liability of EUR 45 million.\n\nSignify reviewed the funding level of the Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan and decided that it would not make a contribution in 2022. Signify expects cash outflows of EUR 8 million in 2023 for the unfunded plans.\n\nFor the funding of the deficit of the US Hourly & Salaried Pension Plan, Signify adheres to the minimum funding requirements of the US Pension Protection Act.\n\n## Germany\n\nFor employees with a salary above a certain salary threshold, there is a funded defined-benefit pension plan which has a deficit of EUR 3 million. This plan has been closed for new entrants since January 1, 2018. Since 2016, Signify no longer makes any contributions to this plan but funds the liabilities when these are paid out to retirees. New employees accrue pension benefits through a defined-contribution plan. For other closed defined-benefit plans, Signify had an unfunded liability of EUR 153 million as at December 31, 2022. Signify expects cash outflows of EUR 17 million in 2023 for the pension plans.\n\nCash outflows for the defined-benefit plans in countries other than the USA and Germany are expected to total EUR 12 million in 2023.\n\n## Risks related to defined-benefit plans\n\nThe defined-benefit plans expose Signify to various demographic and economic risks, such as longevity, investment, currency and interest rate risks and, in some cases, inflation risk. The latter plays a role in the assumed wage increase and in some  plans with pension indexation.\n\nThe larger plans are governed by either independent boards, committees or trustees who have a legal obligation to evenly balance the interests of all stakeholders and operate under the local regulatory frameworks. These bodies are responsible for and have full discretion over the investment strategy of the plan assets, in general they manage pension fund risks by diversifying the investments of plan assets and by (partially) matching interest rate risk of liabilities.\n\nSignify has an active de-risking strategy in which it constantly looks for opportunities to reduce the risks associated with its defined-benefit plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nDuring 2022, worldwide interest rates increased significantly and this has been reflected in higher discount rates. As such, most defined benefit plans experienced large gains on the financial assumptions. In the US, this was offset by losses on plan assets which are predominantly invested in corporate and government bonds and in Germany by losses due to pension increases largely resulting from price inflation.\n\n## Plan assets allocation\n\nThe asset allocation in Signify's pension plans at December 31 was as follows:\n\n| In millions of EUR   |   2021 |   2022 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Debt securities      |    419 |    310 |\n| Equity securities    |     51 |     38 |\n| Other                |     71 |     67 |\n| Total assets         |    541 |    415 |\n\nThe assets in 2022 contained 15% unquoted assets. Plan assets in 2022 do not include property occupied by or financial instruments issued by Signify.\n\nSome 85% of the total plan assets of the Signify pension plan are in the US and are invested in a well-diversified portfolio. The interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio of the US qualified pension plan is closely aligned to that of the plan's pension liabilities. The remaining 15% of the total plan assets is mainly the market value of insured pension benefits.\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThe mortality tables used for Signify's major schemes are:\n\n- \u00b7 US: Base table PRI-2012 White Collar mortality table, projected forward with future mortality improvements according to Scale MP-2021.\n- \u00b7 Germany: Richttafeln 2018 G K. Heubeck.\n\nThe weighted averages of the assumptions used to calculate the defined-benefit obligation as of December 31, 2022 were as follows:\n\n## In %\n\n|                           |   2021 |   2022 |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Discount rate             |    2.3 |    4.8 |\n| Pension cost increases    |    0.4 |    0.5 |\n| Healthcare cost increases |    0.5 |    0.5 |\n| Wage increases            |    0.4 |    1.1 |\n\nThe average duration of the defined-benefit obligation of the defined-benefit plans is 7.7 years.\n\nFor the defined-benefit plans in the US and Germany, the average duration is respectively 7.7 years and 7.4 years. The average discount rates for the plans in these countries are respectively 4.96% and 3.75%. The pension cost increase rate assumption for the German defined-benefit plans is 2.25%.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table below illustrates the approximate impact on the defined-benefit obligation if Signify were to change key assumptions. The defined-benefit obligation was recalculated using a change of 1% in the respective assumptions which overall is considered a reasonably possible change. The impact on the defined-benefit obligation of changes in discount rate is for funded plans normally accompanied by offsetting movements in plan assets, especially when using matching strategies.\n\n|                                         | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Increase                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | (80)   | (52)   |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | 11     | 5      |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | 19     | 10     |\n| Longevity (see explanation)             | 40     | 20     |\n| Healthcare cost change (1% movement)    | 6      | 5      |\n| Decrease                                |        |        |\n| Discount rate (1% movement)             | 91     | 65     |\n| Wage change (1% movement)               | (9)    | (3)    |\n| Pension indexation change (1% movement) | (21)   | (8)    |\n| Longevity (see explanation)             | (33)   | (28)   |\n| Healthcare cost change (1% movement)    | (6)    | (4)    |\n\nLongevity also impacts the post-employment defined-benefit obligation which is illustrated in the above sensitivity table for the impact of a 10% increase and a 10% decrease in the assumed rates of mortality for Signify's major schemes. A 10% decrease in assumed mortality rates equals improvement of life expectancy by six months to a year. Vice versa, an increase in the assumed mortality rates equals reduction of life expectancy.\n\n## 26 Related party transactions\n\nSignify considers the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board to be key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 'Related parties'. For remuneration details of Key Management, see note 28, Information on remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Conditional shares have a three-year cliff vesting period and will vest if a grantee is still employed with Signify at the vesting date.\n\nVesting of performance shares is conditional on the achievement of performance conditions measured over a period of three years. The performance condition measurement is based on four measures, each one of them with an equal weight of 25% of the shares:\n\n- \u00b7 Total shareholder return.\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability.\n- \u00b7 Return on capital employed.\n\nFor the Board of Management and certain members of senior management, the LTI Plan consists of performance shares only. Shares are conditionally granted annually.\n\nIn addition to shares awarded under the Signify LTI Plan, Signify may in individual cases, such as in the hiring process of members of (senior-) management, also grant restricted shares. Restricted shares have either three-year cliff vesting period or vest gradually over the vesting period of one, two or three years.\n\nUnder the terms of the employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), employees are eligible to purchase a limited number of Signify shares at discounted prices through payroll withholdings.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nThe fair value of shares granted with the market performance condition of relative TSR is measured based on Monte Carlo simulation. The closing share price at grant date is adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period, as participants are not compensated for Signify dividend payouts. Monte Carlo simulation takes into account market conditions expected to impact relative Total Shareholders' Return performance in relation to selected peers and the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\nAssumptions used in Monte-Carlo simulation for valuation in %\n\n|                                 | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|\n| Risk-free interest rate         | 0.6%   |\n| Expected share price volatility | 40%    |\n\nThe assumptions were used for these calculations only and do not necessarily represent an indication of Signify management's expectation of future developments for other purposes. Historic volatility was measured over the same timeframe as the simulation period (weighted average 2.6 years).\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for TSR shares is not adjusted for actual performance.\n\nFCF, Sustainability, and ROCE related measurements are non-market performance conditions. Fair value of shares granted under FCF, Sustainability, and ROCE objective conditions equals the closing share price on the grant date, adjusted for the present value of expected dividends during the vesting period.\n\nThe amount calculated as an expense for shares granted with a non-market performance condition is adjusted for actual performance.\n\nA summary of Signify performance shares movements and outstanding balance is presented below.\n\n## Signify performance shares\n\n|                           | 2021      | 2021                                      | 2022        | 2022                                      |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| EUR-denominated           | Shares    | Weighted  average  grant-date  fair value | Shares      | Weighted  average  grant-date  fair value |\n| Balance as at January 1   | 3,380,119 | 20.14                                     | 3,085,771   | 24.51                                     |\n| Granted                   | 579,559   | 50.20                                     | 657,031     | 35.24                                     |\n| Vested                    | (954,446) | 21.18                                     | (1,188,103) | 24.14                                     |\n| Forfeited                 | (177,453) | 22.88                                     | (112,046)   | 32.10                                     |\n| Performance adjustment    | 257,992   | 17.85                                     | (917,348)   | 31.22                                     |\n| Balance as at December 31 | 3,085,771 | 24.51                                     | 1,525,305   | 24.83                                     |\n\nThe performance adjustment originates from updates in the number of shares which are expected to vest in relation to the mentioned non-market performance conditions.\n\nOn December 31, 2022, estimated unrecognized costs related to non-vested performance shares amounted to EUR 19 million.

        "page_content": "The estimated fair value of financial instruments has been determined by Signify using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that will ultimately be realized by Signify upon maturity or disposal. The use of market assumptions and/or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.\n\nThe following hierarchy is applied to classify the financial assets and liabilities:\n\n## Level 1\n\nInstruments included in Level 1 are comprised primarily of listed Eurobonds classified as financial liabilities at amortized cost. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n## Level 2\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, overthe-counter derivatives) are determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nThe fair value of derivatives is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable interest yield curves, basis spread and foreign exchange rates. Please refer to note 2, Significant accounting policies, for further details.\n\n## Level 3\n\nIf one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\nThis applies for Derivative financial assets not designated as hedging instruments, which mainly relate to Signify's participations in Virtual Power Purchase Agreements. These contracts are accounted for as financial instruments (FVTPL) under IFRS 9 and valued by an external valuator, on a quarterly basis. The fair value is calculated as the net forecasted cash in- or outflows discounted to the present value. The unrealized change in fair value of EUR 26 million (2021: EUR 16 million) is recorded in financial income or expense (note 8). Unobservable input data is the volume of generated wind power and the price curves of the respective electricity market.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuating because of changes in the market interest rates. Financial instruments included in the debt position create an inherent interest rate risk. Failure to effectively hedge this risk could negatively impact financial results.\n\nSignify monitors interest rate coverage, short-term and long-term interest rate developments and has the flexibility to opt for different short-term interest periods for the variable debt instruments at roll-over dates and/or could enter into derivative financial instruments to fix interest rates for a certain period of time. As of December 31, 2022, Signify had a ratio of fixedrate debt to total outstanding debt of approximately 75% (2021: 75%).\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted at reporting date shows that if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by 1% from their level of December 31, 2022, with all other variables held constant, the annualized net interest expense would decrease by EUR 3 million. This impact was based on the outstanding net floating debt position as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.\n\nLiquidity risk for Signify is monitored through the Treasury Risk Committee which tracks the development of the actual cash flow position and uses input from a number of sources in order to forecast the overall liquidity position.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows. Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Signify pools cash from subsidiaries to the extent legally and economically feasible; cash not pooled remains available for operational or investment needs. The table below shows details of cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts as of the reporting date:\n\n|                                               | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at banks and in hand                     | 403    | 425    |\n| Short-term deposits                           | 432    | 216    |\n| Other cash equivalents                        | 17     | 35     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 851    | 677    |\n| Bank overdrafts                               | (4)    | (1)    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents and bank overdrafts | 847    | 676    |\n\nSignify has a EUR 500 million revolving credit facility that can be used for general purposes. As of December 31, 2022, Signify did not have any amounts drawn under this facility.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk that reported financial performance, or the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument, will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Signify operates in many countries and currencies and therefore currency fluctuations may inevitably impact its financial results. Signify is exposed to currency risk in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Transaction exposures related to anticipated sales and purchases and on-balance-sheet receivables/payables resulting from such transactions.\n- \u00b7 Financing exposure arising from foreign currency intercompany and external debt and deposits.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of net income in foreign entities.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure of foreign currency denominated equity invested in consolidated companies.\n- \u00b7 Translation exposure to equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and financial assets at fair value.\n\nIt is Signify's policy to reduce the volatility caused by foreign currency movements on its net earnings by hedging the anticipated net exposure of foreign currencies resulting from foreign currency sales and purchases. In general, net anticipated exposures are hedged during a period of 15 months in layers of 20% up to a hedge ratio of 80%, using derivatives.\n\nSignify's policy requires significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally using forwards. However, not every foreign currency can or shall be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost preventing Signify from effectively and/or efficiently hedging its currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for anticipated and committed transaction exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The result deferred in equity will be released to earnings mostly during 2023 at the time when the related hedged transaction affects the Consolidated statement of income. During 2022, EUR nil million (2021: EUR nil million) was recorded within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated statement of income as a result of ineffectiveness on certain anticipated cash flow hedges.\n\nThe total net fair value of hedges related to transaction exposure as of December 31, 2022, was an unrealized liability of EUR 14 million (2021: asset EUR 2 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to no substantial change in the value of the derivatives. The above sensitivity analysis includes a loss of EUR 4 million that would impact the income statement, which would largely offset the opposite revaluation effect on the underlying accounts receivable and payable, and the remaining gain of EUR 4 million would be recognized in equity to the extent that the cash flow hedges were effective.\n\nForeign exchange exposure also arises from intercompany loans and deposits. Where Signify enters into such arrangements the financing is generally provided in the functional currency of the subsidiary. The currency of Signify's external funding and liquid assets is matched with the required financing of subsidiaries either directly through external foreign currency loans and deposits or synthetically by using foreign exchange derivatives. In certain cases, where Signify subsidiaries may also have external foreign currency debt or liquid assets, these exposures are also hedged using foreign exchange derivatives. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of these hedges was an unrealized asset of EUR 6 million (2021: asset EUR 8 million). An instantaneous 10% increase in the value of euro against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would lead to a decrease of EUR 22 million in the value of the derivatives.\n\nTranslation exposure of foreign-currency equity invested in consolidated entities is generally not hedged. However, if a hedge is entered into, it is accounted for as a net investment hedge. During 2022, net investment hedges consisting of foreign currency forward contracts with nominal amount of USD 150 million matured. These hedges partially mitigated foreign currency translation risk arising from the net assets of USD functional currency subsidiaries. These hedges were fully effective, as such there was no ineffectiveness recognized in profit and loss in 2022. As at 31 December 2022, no net investment hedges were outstanding (2021: asset EUR 4 million). Signify may enter into further net investment hedges to partially offset these risks in the future.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in commodity prices.\n\nSignify is a purchaser of certain base metals, precious metals and energy. Signify could hedge certain commodity price risks using derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility. As of December 31, 2022, Signify had EUR 44 million of commodity derivatives recognized in the Statement of financial position (2021: EUR 17 million). Change of the commodity price by 10% will lead to the commodity derivatives value change of EUR 9 million (2021: EUR 7 million).\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk represents the loss that would be recognized at the reporting date, if counterparties failed completely to perform their payment obligations as contracted. Credit risk is present within Signify trade and other receivables and contract assets. To have better insights into the credit exposures, Signify performs ongoing evaluations of the financial and non-financial condition of its customers and adjusts credit limits when appropriate. In instances where the creditworthiness of a customer is determined not to be sufficient to grant the credit limit required, there are a number of mitigation tools that can be utilized to close the gap, including reducing payment terms, cash on delivery, prepayments and pledges on assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Signify invests available cash and cash equivalents and enters into financial derivative instruments with various financial institutions and is exposed to credit risk with these counterparties. Signify does not enter into any financial derivative instruments to protect against default by financial institutions.\n\nWhere possible, Signify requires all financial institutions to complete legally enforceable netting agreements under an International Swap Dealers Association master agreement or otherwise prior to trading, and whenever possible, to have a solid credit rating from generally accepted rating agencies. Signify also regularly monitors the development of the credit risk of its financial counterparties.\n\nSignify minimizes this risk by limiting the deposits made with any single bank and by making deposits, the majority of which is with banks that have strong credit ratings.\n\nMaximum credit risk exposure for Signify equals carrying amounts of all financial assets recognized in the Statement of financial position plus off-balance sheet guarantees provided.\n\n## Country risk\n\nCountry risk is the risk that political, legal, or economic developments in a single country could adversely impact our performance. The country risk per country is defined as the sum of the equity of all subsidiaries and associated companies in country cross-border transactions, such as intercompany loans, accounts receivable from third parties and intercompany accounts receivable.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Signify had country risk exposure of EUR 2.9 billion in the United States, EUR 1.1 billion in the Netherlands and EUR 531 million in China including Hong Kong. Countries where the risk exceeds EUR 200 million but was less than EUR 500 million are Belgium (EUR 493 million), Poland (EUR 422 million), France (EUR 241 million) and Saudi Arabia (EUR 205 million). Countries where the risk exceeded EUR 50 million but was less than EUR 200 million are Mexico, Spain, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, India and Germany. The degree of risk of a country is taken into account when new investments are considered. Signify does not, however, use financial derivative instruments to hedge country risk, except for the net investment hedge as described in the currency risk.\n\n## 30 Events after the balance sheet date\n\nIn January 2023, Signify notified Koninklijke Philips N.V. our desire to extend the duration of the Trade Mark License Agreement (TMLA) for the second term commencing from February 1, 2026, to January 31, 2031. Under the TMLA, Signify is obliged to pay a royalty on the net turnover of all licensed products and services. The applicable royalty percentages for the extended term is 1% and the minimum annual guaranteed royalty payment is EUR 20 million.\n\nNo other subsequent events occurred that are material to Signify.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is embedded in our purpose and integral to our strategy and the way we do business. And we believe we have an important role to play in helping achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). They have been our strategic compass in creating our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 program and commitments. We report our contribution to six SDGs: 3 - Good health and well-being; 7 Affordable and clean energy; 8 - Decent work and economic growth; 11 - Sustainable cities and communities; 12 - Responsible consumption and production; and 13 - Climate action. Through our activities, we contribute to the achievement of these SDGs.\n\nWe create value within the financial, environmental and social domains, and we have made our approach towards long-term value creation transparent by preparing this Annual Report with key elements of the Value Reporting Foundation's Integrated Reporting framework and reporting in accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards.\n\nSignify is subject to E.U. Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (so called EU Taxonomy) and disclosures can be found in section 16.5, EU Taxonomy.\n\nOur value creation model, presented in chapter 3, Create long-term value, shows how our business activities depend on various financial, environmental, and social resources that are converted to outputs. Our activities and their outputs lead to outcomes in terms of the impact made on our stakeholders and society at large. Since 2017, Signify communicates its impacts in monetary terms, enabling more effective and efficient decision making and giving a holistic view on our most prominent risks and opportunities. It also provides further transparency to our stakeholders on company performance. By publishing the results of our analysis and being transparent on the methodology, we strive to contribute to developing a global standard for impact analysis.\n\nOur external auditor Ernst & Young Accountants LLP (EY) has provided reasonable (highest level) assurance on our sustainability performance and sustainability statements in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, sections 3.2, Our impact, 3.3, Our value created, chapter 4, Corporate performance, section 4.2, Sustainability performance and sections 16.1 to 16.4 of the Sustainability statements. The section Responsible Tax Policy as included in sub-section 16.3.5, Business Ethics, the 2019 baseline assumptions, and the \"Double the pace of the Paris Agreement\" are excluded from the audit scope.

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## 16.1.1 D efinition of Signify's strategic focus: the materiality assessment\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur materiality assessment is the first step towards defining our strategy. By identifying future trends and understanding stakeholders' perspectives at a global and local level, we are better able to manage the risks and opportunities that could impact our ability to create value in the long term.\n\nWe define materiality along two axes. The vertical axis captures the importance of each topic for external and internal stakeholders. The horizontal axis captures both our company's significant impacts on the economy, the environment and society, as well as the impact of externalities on our business. Assessing both aspects enables us to prioritize and focus on the most relevant issues in terms of our efforts as well as reporting progress in this Annual Report. Our materiality assessment was conducted using the GRI Standards' principles for defining report content while integrating the concept of double materiality.\n\nAs a first step in our materiality assessment, we use different sources of information to identify possible material topics. This includes external sources (media and trends analysis, on-going stakeholder engagement insights) as well as internal input. Since 2021, we integrate the top risks and opportunities identified during Signify's annual risk workshop to offer a complete overview of our financial and non-financial risks and opportunities and improve the link between sustainability, risk management, and strategy.\n\nIn 2022, we sent an ESG survey to 81 investors to capture further expectations from these stakeholders that are able to judge the financial materiality of our selected ESG topics. By the end of this first phase, we can list all material topics for Signify (17 topics in 2022). To prioritize these topics, Signify organizes dedicated stakeholder engagement activities. In 2022, this consisted of an online survey reaching out to more than 600 internal and external stakeholders (response rate of 15%) and internal strategic discussions. At the end of this process, we are able to identify the most material topics Signify should be reporting on.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\n## On-going discussions\n\nWe engage with stakeholders considered most relevant to our company including customers, employees, suppliers, investors and analysts, municipalities and governments, and civil society organizations. These stakeholders are most likely to be impacted by our activities and have the most influence on achieving our commitments. Capturing perspectives from multiple stakeholder groups enables us to gain broader insights into value creation and contributes to the definition of our future strategy and plans.\n\nIn 2022, we further built our thought leadership on climate action and energy efficiency, given the emergence of the energy crisis triggered by the Russia-Ukraine war. The urgent need to save energy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and save costs, combined with the need to accelerate the electrification of heating and transport, led us to broaden our messaging. Part of Signify's strategic stakeholder engagements focused on the ambition levels and increased action on 2030 and 2050 climate goals with the economic recovery programs of the world's major economies.\n\n## Overview stakeholder engagement activities (non-exhaustive)\n\n| Stakeholder group                                                                                                                                                                        | Stakeholder engagement processes                                                      | Examples of topics discussed   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Business development, lean value chain projects, consumer  panels, Net Promoter Scores, social media, customer surveys, key  account management, sustainability exchanges with customers | Energy crisis and efficiency Satisfaction rates  ESG-performance                      | Customers                      |\n| Regular meetings, quarterly team surveys and employee  development process, sustainability quarterly webcasts and  engagement campaigns                                                  | Strategic alignment sessions  Training & Development    Diversity, equity & inclusion | Employees                      |\n| Virtual roadshows, (ESG) investor conferences, investor webcasts,  investor relations website, investors' perception study                                                               | Strategic alignment sessions ESG-performance                                          | Investors and analysts         |\n| Supplier development, quality improvement projects, cooperation  in industry working groups and strategic commodity management                                                           | ESG-performance    Peer-learning                                                      | Suppliers                      |\n| Annual innovation experience, research projects, advocating  activities, business development, GreenSwitch and Brighten  America programs' implementation                                | Sustainable cities Energy crisis and efficiency Sustainable innovation                | Governments, municipalities    |\n| Partnerships with NGOs, cross-sector (multi-stakeholder),  projects, supplier sustainability stakeholder day, our social  investment program, the Signify Foundation                     | Social impact of light  Sustainable operations  Growth for sustainability             | Civil society organizations    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "We participated in a number of international events and conferences such as WEF Davos, the UN Science Policy Business Forum (preceding Stockholm+50), Climate Week NYC, the 13th Clean Energy Ministerial and COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh. During each of these conferences, we shared our messages and called for a doubling of the speed of action, highlighting the multiple benefits of switching to connected LED lighting and the potential of freeing-up electricity to support electrification of heating and transport.\n\nThroughout the year, our contribution towards the European Green Deal and Recovery process further evolved and became more granular at market and country level in Europe, contributing to topline development. Concurrently, we developed our advocacy approaches in the USA (linked to the Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act) and in China (linked to the 14th five-year plan). We further developed our 'Green Switch' program and are in the process of rolling this out globally. In the USA, we launched a similar program called 'Brighten America', and 'Green Switch China' has been introduced in China.\n\nOur climate and energy advocacy continued through our partnerships with the Corporate Leaders Group Europe, the European Alliance to Save Energy in Europe and through NEMA, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and Alliance to Save Energy in the US. Our team in China builds on China's dual carbon commitment, leveraging our carbon neutral certification there. In 2022, we maintained our memberships and were active in many organizations, including the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the World Economic\n\nForum (WEF), the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), and The Climate Group.\n\n## Materiality assessment engagement\n\nFor the dedicated stakeholder engagement related to our 2022 materiality assessment, we defined stakeholder representatives from each of the six identified groups: customers, employees, investors and analysts, suppliers, governments and municipalities and civil society organizations. Representatives have been selected based on expertise, constituency and geography. The broad range of stakeholders minimizes bias and creates a diverse insight. Stakeholders' expectations and inputs are captured at all phases of our materiality assessment. Through different engagement channels, we inform our stakeholders about our activities, the measures taken and the results.\n\n## 2022 materiality assessment: conclusions\n\nIn 2022, as an outcome of the assessment, we confirm that Climate action and Human rights remain our two most material topics. Business ethics and Safety at work remain very important and Signify has robust processes in place. Social impact of light, Circular economy, Digitalization, and Geopolitical instability are important for Signify and are positioned on the right-hand side of the matrix. Biodiversity and Water are our two least material topics. The result of the materiality assessment has been reviewed by the Leadership Team and the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe details of our 2022 materiality assessment, as well as the definition of each material topic can be found in the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report, available on our Sustainability downloads webpage: https:// www.signify.com/global/sustainability/ downloads.\n\n## Materiality matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Progress is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Board of Management and the Leadership Team. During these meetings, progress on strategic programs is reviewed and corrective actions are taken when necessary.\n\nProgress is also reviewed with the Supervisory Board several times a year. In addition, the results of our sustainability programs are communicated on a quarterly basis to Signify employees and on our website to external stakeholders.\n\nSustainability programs are embedded in the Signify organization and ways of working. Examples of departments that implement sustainability programs include sales, innovation, manufacturing, sourcing, and logistics. Targets on sustainability are set at corporate, division and market levels.\n\n## 16.1.3 P rogram targets\n\nOur sustainability commitments are grouped under our sustainability program Brighter Lives, Better World 2025, launched in September 2020. Targets for this program are set for a five-year period, until the end of 2025, and the baseline year for our doubling commitments is 2019.\n\nChanges in targets, policies, definitions or scope are specified annually. 2022 is the second reporting year.\n\nAdditionally, to ensure our efforts are in line with the targets of the Paris Agreement, we have set Science-Based Targets for our GHG emissions.\n\n## Program 2025 targets\n\n|                   | Doubling objectives                                                   | Continue and strengthen                                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| t e r W o r l d   | Double the pace we achieve the 1.5\u00b0C  scenario of the Paris Agreement | Carbon neutral operations and 100% renewable electricity Increase Climate action revenues to 72% |\n| B e               | Double our Circular revenues to 32%                                   | Zero waste to landfill and sustainable  packaging                                                |\n| v e s             | Double our Brighter lives revenues to  32%                            | 10 million lives lit through our Signify  Foundation                                             |\n| B r i g h t e r L | Double our % of women in leadership  to 34%                           | Safe & healthy workplace with a TRC  rate less than 0.30 Supplier sustainability performance of  |\n\n## Approved Science-Based Targets - 1.5 degrees scenario\n\n|                                                |   Baseline | Target 2030   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|\n| Carbon emissions from scope 1 and scope 2      |       2015 | 70% reduction |\n| Carbon emissions from scope 3 (use of product) |       2015 | 30% reduction |\n\n## 16.1.4 Reporting standards\n\nSignify has reported in accordance with the GRI Standards for the period January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022. We also used additional company disclosures. An overview of the information on data definitions, measurements and any uncertainties inherent to measurements can be found in the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report, available on our Sustainability downloads webpage: https:// www.signify.com/global/sustainability/ downloads.\n\nThese supplements also include more information on our 2022 materiality assessment, a GRI Content Index, our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting and the EU Directive on non-financial information. In 2022, Signify re-committed to the United Nations Global Compact to advance 10 universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anticorruption efforts. This report also serves as our annual Communication on Progress (COP) towards abiding by these principles.\n\nNew Signify ventures and acquisitions are included in environmental and social disclosures to the extent that the integration process of these ventures has been finalized. The normative integration period is two years. Divestitures completed before December 31 of the book-year are excluded from environmental and social reporting. For our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 doubling commitments, we use best estimates for 2019 as a base, including for Cooper Lighting and Klite. These acquisitions are included in our 2022 data but excluded from the reported 2020 comparative figures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our sustainable products and systems must demonstrate proven measurable benefits in one or more of the eight sustainable focal areas (SFAs) compared to the relevant and regularly updated benchmark.\n\nWe have five Better World SFAs:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy & solar - increasing energy efficiency of products, systems and services, and solar systems and solutions.\n- \u00b7 Circularity - optimally preserving value and avoiding waste via serviceable luminaires, circular components, intelligent asset management, and circular services.\n- \u00b7 Packaging - reducing packaging weight and volume, increasing recycled material in the packaging of professional products, eliminating the use of plastics in the packaging of consumer products, and optimizing transportation efficiency.\n- \u00b7 Substances - eliminating harmful substances.\n- \u00b7 Weight & materials - reducing product weight, selecting recycled and/or renewable materials, and increasing commonalities.\n\nAnd three Brighter Lives SFAs:\n\n- \u00b7 Safety & security - providing light that improves the safety of people in traffic, cities and houses and increases protection against cybercrime.\n- \u00b7 Health & well-being - designing light to support health, well-being, and performance of humans, animals and wildlife through unlocking the visual, biological, and emotional benefits of light.\n- \u00b7 Food availability - providing light that enables the production of more and better-quality food, while optimizing the use of land, water and energy and avoiding the use of pesticides.\n\nOur sustainable innovations continue to transform the lighting industry. In 2022, we invested EUR 264 million in sustainable innovation which represents 89.5% of Signify R&D expenses (92.9% in 2021). We believe that sustainable innovation will help create an increasingly future-proof and purposeful portfolio of products, systems and services.\n\n## 4VPUMJOMNMFAJOOPRMUJPO JOANJMMJPOPAPGA&63\n\n\"PAMAglyph<c=6,font=/AAADNV+SignifyRaisonne-DemiBold>APGA3glyph<c=7,font=/AAADNV+SignifyRaisonne-DemiBold>GAPQFOU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.3 Brighter Lives\n\nAs part of our company strategy and our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we aim to double our impact on society, creating brighter lives for all by the end of 2025. We will do this by doubling our Brighter lives revenues, which benefit society by increasing Food availability, Safety & security and Health & well-being. Additionally, we commit to double the percentage of women in leadership by the end of 2025. We will also strengthen our commitments to employee safety, sustainable supply chain and lives lit through the work of the Signify Foundation.\n\n## Kiran Brar, Chief HR Officer, Signify\n\n\"Our objective is to create a great place to work, where people belong, have an impact, and take pride in the company we build together. To achieve this, our 2022 people strategic initiatives focused on creating a more diverse workforce, an inclusive and equitable work environment, and on strengthening our performance culture.\n\nIn 2022, we published our first dedicated DE&I report. To further foster an inclusive workplace, we launched the Powering Inclusion series, which brought together speakers from Harvard Business Publishing and Signify to engage on DE&I topics. I am extremely proud of\n\nhow these practices have been embraced within Signify. With these efforts, we build the skills and capabilities to create an even more inclusive culture across our organization.  In order to strengthen our performance mindset, we transitioned from a semi-annual and rating-driven performance process to an ongoing performance conversation with quarterly, employee-driven goals and feedforward mechanism. A revamped recognition program acknowledges and appreciates those delivering outstanding contributions with development opportunities and rewards. Finally, we laid the groundwork to enable a greater sense of ownership by making our employee share purchase program available to more employees in 2023.\n\nOur team was enriched this year when we welcomed new employees from Fluence and Pierlite, and we continue to integrate our new colleagues and build on our people resources. I am confident that with the talented people we have and with a strong performance culture, we will meet challenges in the year ahead with success.\"",

The remaining 9% worked in corporate functions. During 2022, the overall number of employees (in FTEs, mainly contingent workers) decreased in line with the ongoing external workforce changes and digital transformation and we expect the nature of the current workforce will continue to evolve.\n\nIn 2022, Signify's adjusted employee turnover was 17% (2021: 19%), a reduction of 2% compared to 2021. On a reported basis, the total turnover was 48% (2021: 54%) including\n\n## Employee turnover breakdown in 2022 in %\n\n|                      | Staff (majority  in factory)   | Professional   | Mid-Level  Professional   | Senior-Level  Professional   | Leadership   | Grand Total   |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Total adjusted  1    | 6%                             | 8%             | 2%                        | 1%                           | -%           | 17%           |\n| Total                | 39%                            | 7%             | 2%                        | -%                           | -%           | 48%           |\n| of which voluntary   | 25%                            | 4%             | 1%                        | -%                           | -%           | 30%           |\n| of which involuntary | 14%                            | 3%             | 1%                        | -%                           | -%           | 18%           |\n\n1 Excluding manufacturing population from Mexico\n\nthe specifics of the Mexican labor law, which prohibits contingent labor and therefore causes a significant impact on a consolidated basis. Signify applies high standards in its factories around the world to ensure its competitiveness in highly dynamic labor markets, while continuously improving employee satisfaction and reducing turnover.\n\n## Talent Management\n\nWith close to 35,000 employees all over the world, our people are central to the effective execution of our strategy. We believe that we will maintain our position as the market leader in lighting by being a talent-builder,\n\ndeveloping and growing people from within. We want our employees to have a challenging and rewarding work experience; one where they can grow and make an impact, and where they gain new experiences and develop themselves.\n\nOur approach to talent is to continuously build and develop employees' functional and leadership skills, whilst attracting new, diverse talent where critical capabilities are needed to strengthen our talent pool. Retaining our talent remained a key priority in the course of 2022 and we have been focusing on fostering internal mobility by supporting the match of our talents with internal opportunities.\n\nIn 2022, next to our acquisitions, we welcomed 11,063 external talents to help bring our business vision to life, most of whom were employed in manufacturing functions. In line with our people philosophy to promote talent from within the organization, close to 80% of our senior management and leadership roles were filled internally.\n\n## A robust global employer brand\n\nIn 2022, we continued to build on our Employer Value Proposition (EVP): while our pillars remained the same, as an innovative, sustainable industry leader with an essential focus on continuous learning as well as DE&I, we updated our EVP toolkit with well-being practices and flexible working.\n\nIn 2022, we received recognition for being an employer of choice in various countries, for example: Certification as Top Employer in the Netherlands, China, Brazil (Top Employer\u00ae Institute), Great Place to work (The Great Place to Work\u00ae Institute) in Turkey and we made it again to Mogul's list of 2022 Top 100 Companies for Diverse Representation.\n\nWe directed our recruitment marketing campaigns at the most critical segments, to drive our transformation and growth and build talent pipelines. In 2022, we focused on\n\nreaching diverse candidates in technology, marketing, finance and sales with relevant messaging customized per region reflecting our EVP.\n\nAs part of our global talent acquisition strategy, we continue to attract talent from proven high-quality sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal - Over the last few years we have filled approximately 40% of our vacancies internally.\n- \u00b7 Employee referral - 18% of total external hires came from employee referrals.\n- \u00b7 Signify careers website - Via our content strategy on social media \"Humanizing our employer brand\", we saw high engagement rates on social media driven by our employees sharing content and our stories on why Signify is a great place to work, in alignment with our values and EVP.\n\nOur employer brand awareness survey showed an increase in active candidates and we improved our rating on Glassdoor, a wellknown website where current and former employees anonymously review companies.",

        "page_content": "## Culture\n\nOur company culture is comprised of four foundational elements: purpose, values, sustainability and DE&I. Our company purpose and values provide employees with direction about why we exist, what we value, and how we work. Throughout 2022, we have been adapting our approach to performance in our desire to have more ongoing performance and development conversations and shift towards a performance mindset.\n\nIn late 2021, together with our leaders, we embarked on a journey to unlock our individual and collective performance, and in 2022, we engaged our global team members. We reinforced our culture with our Unlock Performance practices, where both employees and people managers take an active role together to drive individual and company performance. It starts with a steadfast commitment to regular, open, forward-thinking performance conversations between employees and managers. During these conversations, employees can share their progress against goals and their learning and development priorities. Managers demonstrate support through active listening and coaching to enable employees to break through performance obstacles and grow. We also promote the practice of feedforward, which is the practice of soliciting input from peers, direct reports or managers that help identify ways an employee can perform even stronger in future situations. In 2022, we introduced these practices to our teams with positive responses; through our quarterly survey 86% of our employees reported to have constructive conversations with their manager about performance and development.\n\nAs we look to 2023 and beyond, we will continue to enhance these practices, embed the mindset into our culture and coach our managers and employees to further unlock performance at Signify.\n\n## Employee engagement & well-being\n\nEmployee engagement and well-being are key to our competitive performance and integral to our people vision: creating a workplace where people belong, have impact and take pride in the company we build together. Engaged employees are committed to our company. They help us to meet our business goals and sustainability commitments, whilst contributing to a dynamic, high-performance workplace.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our grassroots initiatives across the globe to create awareness about employee engagement & well-being:\n\n- \u00b7 Coffee Corners and global webcasts, to reinforce the connection between our people and our leaders.\n- \u00b7 Well-being Webinar Program (online webinars) and activity clubs.\n- \u00b7 Health checks in Netherlands and Greater China, for employees to get personal feedback on their health and specific suggestions on follow up.\n- \u00b7 Employee Assistance Program in India, with monthly webinars offering free teleconsultation support to all employees and their family for any kind of wellness queries and support.\n- \u00b7 Broadening time-off policies in the US to focus on wellness, making specific mention of mental and emotional health and evaluated medical leave of absence procedures to ensure they are inclusive\n- and cover mental health issues appropriately.\n- \u00b7 More than 3800 food packages delivered to the homes of our employees in Shanghai during the two-month lockdown caused by the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nBecause sustainability is central to our company strategy, we have engaged our employees on the topic of sustainability since 2019. We do this with quarterly employee engagement themes and challenges that help employees reflect on and connect personal values with the business practices of Signify.\n\nOur Signify Team Survey poses questions in line with our company purpose and values, and it has proven to be a positive driver of employee engagement to increase team effectiveness. As a result, we have continued to run the Team survey every quarter to monitor employee engagement and take corrective actions when needed. Through the Signify Team Survey, in 2022 92% of our employees said that we truly put our Customer First (2021: 91%); 89% of our employees acknowledged that we are Greater Together (2021: 87%); 86% of our employees felt that we are a Game Changer (2021: 85%) and 89% of our employees agreed that we have Passion for Results (2021: 87%). We noted that we need to continue improving in the areas of recognition. Initiatives to address our improvement points are driven at a team level via our Team dialogues, and we continue to track progress on these questions during our Quarterly Performance Reviews.\n\nTo measure employee satisfaction, the Net Promoter Score (NPS) methodology is used as part of our Team survey. Employees are\n\nasked to rank how likely it is that they would recommend our company as a great place to work. In 2022, the Team survey had an average employee response rate of 83% (2021: 84%). At the end of 2022, we recorded an average annual NPS score of 36 across the Signify population (2021: 30). Despite the challenges faced in 2022, our employee engagement score increased to the highest level since we began running the survey and remains in the top 25% of companies making up the ETS eNPS benchmark.\n\n## Learning & development\n\nLearning continues to be a competitive advantage at Signify and plays an important role in attracting and retaining talent. In 2022, people connected virtually on our knowledge-exchange platforms to consume or to share their knowledge with colleagues. We updated our methodology to calculate the rate of active learners including both voluntary and mandatory trainings. At the end of 2022, the learning experience platform Learning@Signify reached an active learner rate of 97%. The average number of hours spent on training and development per FTE was 24 hours during 2022 (2021:34). Multiple Subject Matter Experts created learning pathways around critical areas to share their knowledge with others bringing our vision 'everyone is a student; everyone is a teacher' to life. A dedicated program was designed to focus on critical capabilities in the manufacturing environment.\n\nEvery quarter, Signify employees were stimulated to learn new skills. In the first quarter of 2022, \"Simplify\" was launched - a learning program to support the organization to strengthen our performance mindset to\n\n<!-- image -->",

Meetings, email, and presentations all help us communicate, but they can also slow us down. To break the habits that slow us down, for a strong performance culture and a great place to work, we engaged with our employees in a dialogue of sharing best practices on how to work smarter in a faster world.\n\n## Upskill for greater customer impact\n\nWe continue to develop commercial skills in the organization through our \"Impact program\". It introduces a consultative and innovative approach to selling, with a greater emphasis on relationship building and trust. In total, 14 global training cohorts got involved in this 24-week training program in 2022.\n\n## Upskill for digitalization\n\nHow do we lead the digital transition and transform our business models for the future? In 2022, we continued to invest in digital reskilling designed around critical digital competencies such as: Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Data & Analytics (AI / Machine Learning / Data Analytics), Cloud Computing, Information & Cyber security, AGILE (SAFe & SCRUM), eCommerce, critical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.\n\n## Leadership development\n\nWe continued to ensure that our leadership development experiences are aligned with our manager framework of lead, develop and inspire and with our talent philosophy. In 2021, we introduced the iEDGE program to increase the effectiveness of first-time people managers by covering the essentials of people management. In 2022, the program included 90 participants. This ensured that our people leaders continued to get support in their roles for Signify to build a pipeline of future-ready leaders who can further drive excellence and sustainable growth.\n\nIn 2022, we further expanded our Edge portfolio by introducing a new EdgeNext program to accelerate the leadership development of our enterprise leaders, preparing them for next level challenges and driving our strategy. The program included 22 participants. In 2023, we will continue to improve the leadership offerings ensuring our leaders are equipped to lead, develop, and inspire our people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## D iversity, equity & inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Signify, we believe that a diverse workforce and an inclusive work environment are essential to a thriving innovative business and long-term value creation. We are an equal opportunity employer committed to DE&I in the workplace. This means we celebrate and foster an environment in which all ideas, perspectives, experiences and styles are highly valued and where all individuals are treated fairly with equal access to opportunities and resources. Diverse representation in our workforce is critical for our long-term success as a company. It enables us to understand, connect and communicate with our customers, end-users and stakeholders while helping us to attract and retain people who want to be part of our purpose to unlock the extraordinary potential of light for brighter lives and a better world. Our DE&I roadmap reinforces our Greater Together value, enabling us to make better decisions, boost innovation, create growth, and strengthen our culture.\n\nIn 2021, we signed the United Nations (UN) Women Empowerment Principles, which underpins our commitment to double the percentage of women in leadership in our business to 34% by the end of 2025, and is another step towards ensuring equal opportunities, fairness, and impartiality for all. On 25 th of July 2022, Signify published its first-ever DE&I report. This report is a snapshot of our progress, highlighting the\n\nareas where we still need to act and telling the story of our continued journey towards a more inclusive and equitable workplace. In this report, we announced that we have achieved gender pay equity within Signify. Our DE&I report is available on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/ourcompany/investors/sustainability.\n\nIn 2022, our DE&I champions' network grew to around 240 members, who continue to drive actions locally and share best practices. Our DE&I Board, created in 2019, further structured and developed our roadmap.\n\nWe continued to reinforce our existing '2+1' approach i.e., global focus on two specific diversity dimensions of gender (increasing representation of women) and generation (increasing early career talents) with space for markets, divisions and functions to locally implement additional important and relevant initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We set up plans to address gaps and accelerate our progress, so that our talent pipeline reflects all aspects of diversity in the markets in which we operate. To strengthen these efforts, we launched in 2022 a 'license to hire' training for all people managers to enhance their skills and knowledge during recruitment around DE&I (e.g., fairness of process, fair decision-making, candidate experience, equity, etc.). In partnership with Harvard Business Publishing, we focused on ensuring DE&I is a cornerstone of our culture. We address topics such as unconscious bias, microaggressions and covering, and inclusive leadership.We have embedded the inclusive Leadership Model into the iEDGE leadership program, which targets our new people leaders. Two out of seven modules are dedicated to 'Creating a\n\nculture of Trust and Inclusion' and 'Realizing our diversity ambitions'. The course material is available to all employees on Learning@Signify. We conducted sessions on creating a culture of belonging and inclusion and realizing our diversity ambitions in partnership with our provider, Hult International Business School.\n\nIn 2022, 41% of Signify employees were women (2021: 40%) and 28% of leadership roles (positions graded H22+ on the Hay grading scale) across the company were held by women (2021: 25%). We are slightly off track to reach our 2025 target of 34% women in leadership positions. Additionally, in 2022, 50% of our new hires were women (2021: 51%). From a generational perspective, 17% of employees were 30 years old or under (2021: 18%). We have the ambition to attract and retain more early-\n\ncareer talents to build a sustainable talent pipeline.\n\nAs a company, we are naturally diverse, operating in 74 countries with more than 95 nationalities represented in our workforce. Globally, we recognize that we need a more diverse workforce, especially in management and executive positions. Therefore, over the last two years, we have intensified our efforts on increasing the representation of women and early-career talents in our company. We are committed to improving diversity at all levels, attracting candidates from more diverse pipelines and driving development and internal mobility to increase representation across our company.\n\nTo ensure an inclusive business model, Signify collaborates with key strategic suppliers to drive better DE&I performance across its value chain. In 2022, we engaged with key\n\nsuppliers to exchange best practices via a dedicated online program and we included the topic of DE&I in our Tritium program (see more in sub-section 16.3.3) to reward suppliers already adopting practices promoting DE&I. Globally, we recognize the need for a more diverse representation in the areas of gender and age, and we continually monitor related data to support our aim of reaching greater diversity representation in our organization. Over the past three years we have maintained the representation from different generations in our workforce. We plan to further improve our generational diversity in the future by increasing the inflow of early-career talents. We believe in the importance of being intentional and accountable to advance DE&I and create brighter lives and a better world.\n\n100",

Signify establishes formal pay policies and practices that govern hiring, benefit entitlements, annual merit, and promotional guidelines to ensure equity. Furthermore, Signify performs regular reviews that are designed to ensure compliance with our policy of equal pay for equal work and all local legal requirements in the countries in which we operate. Our regular review process includes a comprehensive statistical analysis of pay to employees across the world. Any statistically-significant variance within any employee group is promptly addressed. More can be found in our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Report.\n\n## 16.3.3 Human rights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our approach\n\nRespecting human rights is a central foundation of the way we work. Our commitment to respecting and promoting human rights extends beyond our own operations, across our wider sphere of influence, including our supply chain. To that end, we integrate human rights considerations into our policies, processes, and practices. Our Human Rights policy is based on the International Bill of Human Rights, the United Nations Global Compact Ten Principles, and the International Labour Organization's declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at work. Signify carries\n\nout continuous research and stakeholder engagement activities to identify the most salient ethical and social principles that govern our relationship with stakeholders worldwide.\n\nIn 2022, following our process for identification of new salient human right issues, we added 'Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking', to ensure we create the processes to prevent its occurrence in our own operations and supply chain. We also established a Human Rights Committee, formed by senior leaders of the company, with the objective to sign-off on the selection of the salient human rights issues and agree on the corrective actions in case\n\nof any finding through our different assessment processes. The table below shows, in random order, the salient issues identified and the stakeholders they affect, as well as references to the sub-sections of this report that contain the progress Signify made in addressing these issues.\n\n## Human rights risk assessment\n\nCompliance with the Human Rights policy is governed through our Integrity code processes, combined with dedicated steps that help ensure adherence. In 2022, employees were requested to complete elearnings that helped interpret our Integrity Code. Dedicated communication campaigns urged everyone to speak up and report\n\nconcerns of possible violations. In those campaigns, the availability of our Ethics hotline was also highlighted. This initiative is an integrated and ongoing activity we have embedded in our business and business principles, which we redeploy on a regular basis and share with our new employees as part of their on-boarding program.\n\nBased on a country risk assessment, multiple manufacturing locations were considered to have an increased likelihood of policy violations. Since 2017, these locations are requested to periodically fill in a dedicated self-assessment on human rights. In 2021, we identified five sites from one of our newlyacquired operations where some practices\n\n## Salient human rights issues\n\n| Salient human rights issues                        | Rights holders covered in our programs   | Rights holders covered in our programs   | Rights holders covered in our programs   | Reference to our disclosures                                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 Freedom of association and collective bargaining | (3rd party) employees \u00b7                  | Direct suppliers \u00b7                       | Indirect suppliers                       | 16.3.5: Business ethics 16.3.3: Human Rights                                       |\n| 2 Safe & healthy workplace                         | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        |                                          | 16.3.4: Safety at work 16.3.3: Human rights                                        |\n| 3 Working hours                                    | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        |                                          | 16.3.5: Business ethics 16.3.3: Human Rights                                       |\n| 4 Equal employment opportunities and respect       |                                          |                                          |                                          | 16.3.2: Diversity, equity & inclusion 16.3.3: Human rights 16.3.5: Business ethics |\n| 5 Recognition and reward                           | \u00b7 \u00b7                                      | \u00b7 \u00b7                                      |                                          | 16.3.2: Diversity, equity & inclusion 16.3.3: Human rights 16.3.5: Business ethics |\n| 6 Modern Slavery & Human Trafficking               | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        | 16.3.3: Human rights                                                               |\n| 7 Forced and child labor                           |                                          | \u00b7                                        | \u00b7                                        | 16.3.3: Human rights                                                               |\n| 8 Employee development                             | \u00b7                                        |                                          |                                          | 16.3.1: Talent & Development 16.3.5: Business ethics                               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following a reassessment in 2022, no additional sites had non-compliance findings.\n\n## Living wages\n\nRecognition and rewards have been identified as an important engagement driver for our employees and direct suppliers. By ensuring good working conditions, Signify not only aims to provide a fair, safe, and respectful work environment, but also an inspiring place to work and grow. Fair remuneration is considered a precondition for our employees to flourish. Signify provides total compensation that is in line with the industry practices in the markets in which we operate. In addition, we are committed to providing our employees with a living wage, ensuring that their everyday needs are met. The guiding principles of our pay policy include providing competitive compensation relative to all labor markets, ensuring equity, and providing a living wage to our employees.\n\nAs such, to ensure compliance against our guiding principles, Signify launched its Living Wages program in 2017. Regularly, Signify performs an analysis of salaries and benefits for employees globally with respect to a living wage, covering the necessary living costs. We focus on employees who have a higher risk of not receiving a living wage by analyzing 42 regions in 6 different countries (representing 78% of the overall Signify population). We\n\ncompare our wages to the WageIndicator Foundation database.\n\nThe 2022 results show that company standards exceed the living wage standards in all regions examined, except seven, which together represent 12% of the population analyzed in the six principal countries. We are developing remediation actions to close the gaps identified in these seven regions.\n\nOne region identified during the 2021 analysis had 91% of the population not meeting the living wage standard, while in 2022 the same region had 51% of the population not meeting the living wage standard thanks to a 22% increase in national minimum wages. In the second region identified in 2021, the total population of Signify employees increased by 322%, while we saw an increase of 59% in the absolute number of employees below the living wage standard in this region. At the same time, we saw a decrease in the relative share of employees below the living wage standard from 96% to 36%.\n\nFair compensation in terms of wages, overtime and benefits for our suppliers' employees in risk countries is part of our sustainable supply chain program. We collect relevant data and through our active engagement, 84% of our risk suppliers met our requirements on wages and benefits. We closely follow the developments in the field of Living Wages and in 2022 we joined the dedicated RBA Living Wages task force.\n\n## Social responsibility in our supply chain\n\nWe have a direct business relationship with more than 3,000 product and component suppliers. Responsible procurement practices and management of our supply chain require a structured and innovative approach due to the wide variety of stakeholders. Signify has developed programs over the years to prevent human rights violations in its supply chain. These programs cover the assessment and development of supplier sustainability performance (audits and training) and responsible minerals sourcing. As part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we commit to have a supplier sustainability performance rate annual target of 95% until the end of 2025.\n\nOur Tritium program helps us develop a strong supply chain with best-in-class suppliers and is based on selection and rewards criteria against our strategic priorities. The Tritium rating strongly drives continuous improvement of our supplier sustainability performance. Sustainability maturity and initiatives on Human rights, Working conditions, Climate action and DE&I are rewarded in the Tritium system with reward points. Non-compliance is penalized and needs to be corrected or will result in consequences for the business relation. Through our efforts, we foster decent work and economic growth by improving the safety and well-being of suppliers and directly contribute to SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth.\n\n## Supplier sustainability performance\n\nThe core of our supplier sustainability performance program is the Supplier Sustainability Declaration (SSD). This\n\ndeclaration forms an integral part of our supplier contracts and can be found on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/ contact/suppliers/sustainability/ourprograms/supplier-sustainabilitymanagement.\n\nThe SSD is derived from the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct and sets out the standards and behaviors we require from our suppliers and their suppliers. It covers labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. We monitor supplier compliance with the SSD through a system of regular audits. In the RBA Code of Conduct and in our SSD, special attention is given to the prevention of human slavery as referred to in the United Kingdom (UK) Modern Slavery Act Disclosures and the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The formal statement on these laws can be found on our website.\n\nOur audit program consists of full audits performed by an independent audit firm for selected suppliers in risk countries with a spend threshold of EUR 1 million per year. The audit program also covers new suppliers introduced by our recent acquisitions (with a same spend threshold for Cooper Lighting and a spend threshold of EUR 5 million per year for Klite). To improve sustainable practices in our supply chain, we want to increase the number of our suppliers that either are low risk or have a mature sustainability practices and good performance. We encourage suppliers to certify to the SA8000, ISO14000 and ISO 45001 standards or to become member of the Responsible Factory Initiative (RFI), a program offered by RBA experts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For suppliers that score well but need corrective actions, we keep the three-year audit cycle. Suppliers that pass the audit with no need for corrective action will be exempted from the audit program until a complaint or an issue is raised by internal stakeholders or from external sources. At the end of 2022, 189 suppliers were part of\n\nour audit program (69% of Signiyf's total spend), of which 22 were not audited to the travel restrictions and lockdowns. Among them, 157 suppliers (94%) are compliant by passing the audit or by resolving identified non-conformities. Ten suppliers (6%) were not able to correct their non-conformance within six months and are considered noncompliant. We applied our consequence management process. In total, at the end of 2022, our compliance rate was 94%, slightly\n\nbelow our annual target of 95%. In 2022, despite the restrictions caused by COVID, we audited 79 suppliers on-site and reached close to 33,000 workers employed at the sites audited. Most of Signify suppliers are based in China (54%), followed by India (7%) and Mexico (7%).

        "page_content": "As part of our onboarding process, we also audited 46 new suppliers to assess their maturity.\n\nThe assurance of freely chosen employment in our supply chain is a key element of our sustainability objectives. Forced labour is considered a zero-tolerance issue and Signify's policy requires immediate remediation if observed.\n\nWe have been closely following the implementation of the US's Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) and, in response, we are now planning for additional compliance and due diligence mechanisms. This includes inquiry of Tier 1 suppliers and putting in place upstream traceability of raw materials at risk.\n\n## Supplier training and developments\n\nSince 2017, we have put in place training for our suppliers to share our learnings and support more sustainable practices among our suppliers. In 2022, we organized two webinars on RBA Code of Conduct focusing on the top 20 most frequent nonconformities found in our audit program. 76 suppliers joined, with a total of 164 attendees.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our Supplier Carbon Disclosure Program with 54 suppliers attending the training sessions. With our Printed Circuit Boards suppliers we deep dived on energy consumption and noise level on the shop floor.\n\nWe initiated a new DE&I program in our supply chain and organized four best practices sharing sessions with eight key suppliers. Through our audit program, we have\n\nidentified that more than 25% of our suppliers have already set DE&I targets and/ or signed a DE&I pledge.\n\n## Responsible mineral sourcing\n\nOur commitment to sustainable development extends to issues further down the supply chain, to prevent human rights abuses and financing of conflicts in the extractive sector. Global supply chains in the lighting industry are long and complex, typically with more than seven tiers between the finished product and the source of raw materials used for manufacturing. However, we believe that through strong multi-stakeholder partnerships we can make a difference.\n\nAs part of the Signify Conflict Minerals program, we implement measures in our supply chain to ensure that our products are not directly or indirectly funding atrocities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We support and follow the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and HighRisk Areas. The full description of our due diligence process and Signify's position on Conflict Minerals are available on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/ contact/suppliers/sustainability/ourprograms/conflict-minerals.\n\nSince 2016, we are a member of the European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM), a public-private partnership initiative. The EPRM provides a platform for cooperation between European governments, companies and civil society to address the issues occurring in the mining of minerals and to enable responsible sourcing from high risk and conflict regions.\n\nWe are also an active member of the Responsible Mineral Initiative (RMI) which runs the audit program to verify the smelters' conflict-free status and to identify sources of 3TG and cobalt in our supply chain. We use the tools and programs developed by the RMI, especially the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), the Extended Minerals Reporting Template (EMRT) and the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP). Each year, we update our list of smelters using the CMRT and/or the EMRT information provided by our Tier 1 suppliers.\n\nThe smelters identified through this process are included in the Signify smelter list published in our Signify Conflict Minerals Declaration (see link below).\n\nIn prior year, we identified 324 3TG smelters, of which 83% were conformant or in the compliance process with RMI audits, 15% were not yet included in the process and 2% were non-conformant (eight cases). We also identified seven smelters for cobalt, of which one was non-conformant. This year, we were able to remove two 3TG and one Cobalt nonconformant smelters via outreach to our Tier 1 suppliers and follow-up by RMI.\n\nIn 2022, we unfortunately saw the number of non-conformant smelters increasing due to recent global developments such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the ban on Russian minerals. By the end of 2022, we identified 20 non-conformant smelters in our supply chain and an action plan for 2023 is being prepared. More can be found on our website: https://www.signify.com/global/contact/ suppliers/sustainability/our-programs/ responsible-minerals.\n\nCobalt is present in our battery supply chain only for emergency lighting and remote controls. To enhance transparency in the cobalt supply chain, in 2018 we co-founded the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA) with Fairphone, Huayou and Impact Facility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis multi-stakeholder action platform offers actors across the cobalt supply chain a precompetitive environment for collaboration to help strengthen and professionalize DRC's artisanal cobalt mining sector and contribute to local economic development at large. In 2022, we worked on a Signify Solar project at a Kolwezi community (DRC) where we completed the solar electrification of seven schools, reaching more than 6000 pupils.

We commit to provide a safe working environment for our employees and we contribute to the achievement of SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth,\n\nThe total recordable cases (TRC) rate is the central lagging indicator through which we measure our overall safety performance. Targets for this indicator are set and managed at a company-wide level, and for the individual divisions, manufacturing sites and distribution centers.\n\nAs part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we continue to commit to a safe and healthy workplace with a TRC target of 0.30 by the end of 2025, and the ambition for each single site to reach it.\n\nIn 2022, we focused on increasing injury prevention capabilities at a site level by launching dedicated and mandatory trainings for EHS Managers on site. We started the digitalization of EHS reporting that will allow deeper and more effective analysis of workplace hazards and related risks. In our operations, we continued the STAR (StopThink-Act- Reflect) campaign to increase hazard awareness of employees and to promote accountability to stop and speak-up when facing a non-standard or hazardous situation at work. Safety Week 2022 was dedicated to the concept of 'Safety as state\n\nof mind'. As part of this campaign, we relaunched the Signify 10 Golden Safety Rules training and the 'Heroes of Safety' global competition.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to improve equipment safety, warehousing safety, behavioral safety and drive cross-site prevention via the Safety Alerts process. Our injury prevention framework, launched in 2015 and adopted by our industrial sites, has been further integrated into the operational Lean framework, the Manufacturing Standards platform and Signify Quality System. A dedicated EHS integration programs was executed for our joint-venture Klite.\n\nGoing forward, to realize our zero injury workplace ambition, we will reinforce workplace and behavioral hazards identification and elimination. We are addressing this by increasing employee capabilities for injury prevention, daily leader standard work for safety and a digitalized hazards reporting and monitoring system.\n\nWe recorded 47 TRC cases in 2022 (2021: 58) and had no fatality incident. The TRC rate decreased to 0.16 per 100 FTEs, compared to 0.17 in 2021. This is a 6% improvement compared to 2021.\n\nIn 2022, 64% of our industrial sites had no recordable injuries. There were 19 industrial sites that have had no recordable injuries over the last 3 years, while 32 sites had achieved more than 500 injury-free days.\n\n## Recordable cases\n\n|                             |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total recordable  case rate |   0.22 |   0.17 |   0.16 |\n| Severe injuries             |  21    |  18    |   7    |\n| Severity rate               |   0.06 |   0.05 |   0.02 |\n| Lost workday  cases rate    |   0.17 |   0.12 |   0.09 |\n| Fatalities                  |   0    |   0    |   0    |\n\n## Management system\n\nManufacturing sites continued to be certified locally and via multi-site certificates and at the end of 2022, 61% of our reporting manufacturing sites were ISO 45001 certified. The remaining manufacturing sites have procedures in place to foster compliance with local regulations and Signify policies.\n\n## 16.3.5 Business ethics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signify's Integrity code\n\nOur Integrity code serves as our code of conduct. This code embodies our commitment to always act with integrity, both in our internal and external interactions. The code sets the standard for business conduct of our employees and for the company itself and also gives more information on how to speak up or raise concerns. Translations of our Integrity code are available in 26 languages. For a description of Integrity code processes and policies, please refer to chapter 12, Risk factors and risk\n\nmanagement, section 12.1, Establish a strong risk management environment.\n\nIn 2022, we focused on increasing employee awareness during the onboarding process. To ensure that new employees gain the necessary knowledge of legal compliance to perform their jobs, targeted communication on our online courses is sent to them in the first two weeks of their onboarding. This is to actively encourage all new joiners to go through our courses and to promote ethical behavior at work. By the end of 2022 the completion rate of our e-learnings was 95.5% of the targeted employees. Our current program covers antitrust, anticorruption and anti-money laundering, privacy and data protection, export controls and sanctions, security, speaking up and business integrity.\n\nIn 2022, 244 Integrity code concerns were captured via the Signify Ethics line and through our network of compliance officers, a 25% increase compared to 2021. The number of concerns raised is substantially higher than in the previous year. Details per category are shown in the table.\n\n## Most commonly reported concerns Treatment of employees\n\nThe category Treatment of employees represents 53% of the total cases reported (46% in 2021). Within this category, the largest subcategory is Equal, fair and respectful treatment. This made up to 79% of the concerns related to Treatment of employees in 2022 (66% in 2021). This category, for example, relates to concerns about verbal abuse, (sexual) harassment, favoritism and matters of discrimination in the workplace.\n\n<!-- image -->",

During 2022, a total number of 244 cases were reported. As per December 2022, 50 cases were open. That means that during 2022, we closed 223 cases. Of these 223 cases, 91 were found to be substantiated, which represents 41% of the closed cases.\n\nSubstantiated cases are followed up with corrective actions.

In 2022, Signify applied disciplinary actions ranging from training and coaching to verbal and written warnings and to termination of employment, depending on the severity of the matter.\n\n## Responsible tax policy\n\nOur tax principles are based on the recognition that tax is an integral element of our overall corporate social responsibility as well as commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Developments Goals.\n\nResponsible Tax is an important topic for Signify to report on. For us, acting with integrity means paying the right amount of tax, in the right place, at the right time. Being a responsible taxpayer is aligned with our purpose, business strategy and Integrity code. We are committed to providing timely, regular, and reliable information on Signify's tax position, including the Group effective tax rate, our total tax contributions, and our main tax exposures (see chapter 14, Consolidated financial statements, note 9, Income taxes).\n\nWe embrace the Tax Governance Code, as published by the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNONCW) in 2022 and provide more information on our Tax Principles, Tax Strategy, Tax Organization and Tax Contributions in our Tax Report: https://www.signify.com/global/ourcompany/investors/governance.\n\n## Tax governance, control and risk management\n\nThe responsibility for Signify's Tax Strategy, Tax Principles and how we manage our tax risks, ultimately rests at our Board of Management with the CFO. At least once a year, the Tax Principles and Tax Strategy as well as the Tax Risks are discussed with Signify's Board of Management. If needed these principles and strategy are updated and subsequently approved by our Board of Management.\n\nSignify's Tax Principles ensure compliance with local and international tax laws and regulations for all our group entities. These principles govern how Signify operates with customers, suppliers, contractors, and employees. We aim to prepare and file all required tax returns on time, providing complete, accurate and timely disclosures to all relevant tax authorities.\n\nSignify has a Tax Control Framework in place, to monitor and test the execution of critical tax processes as well as for risk management. Our Tax Controls are part of our Business Control Framework and our internal controls for financial reporting (ICS). They are monitored and documented by our Tax Organization and the dedicated ICS team. Internal auditors regularly review our tax controls and external auditors review our key tax positions and our tax processes as part of the audit of our Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We regularly participate in meetings of business groups, to learn from our stakeholders and to provide our view on tax developments.\n\nSignify aims to build and maintain a cooperative and healthy working relationship with all relevant (tax) authorities. The transparency in our tax policy is a key factor in building mutual respect and trust with tax authorities.\n\n## Total tax contribution\n\nOur total tax contributions in the financial year 2022 amounted to EUR 1.1 billion. This amount consists of both taxes borne and taxes collected by Signify. The taxes borne include the income tax paid, customs duties, VAT and the employer part of the payroll taxes. For more information on the definitions used in this chapter, please refer to chapter 19, Definitions and abbreviations.\n\n## Total tax contributions by type EUR million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate income tax\n\nCustoms duties\n\nVAT\n\nPayroll taxes\n\nOther taxes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total tax contributions by region EUR million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmericas\n\nEurope\n\nRest of the World\n\n## 2022 Signify corporate income tax paid per\n\n## main countries\n\n| Countries         |   EUR million |\n|-------------------|---------------|\n| France            |            20 |\n| China             |            15 |\n| The Netherlands   |            13 |\n| India             |            12 |\n| Mexico            |             2 |\n| Poland            |             9 |\n| Belgium           |             4 |\n| Canada            |             3 |\n| The United States |             1 |\n| Other             |            20 |\n| Total             |            99 |\n\nThe amounts of corporate income tax paid reflect the geographic spread of Signify's activities. The most significant amounts are paid and accrued in China, the Netherlands, and India where Signify has substantial business operations. In France, we paid high income tax due to income resulting from the sale of non-strategic real estate. In the United States, Belgium and France we used losses from prior years, resulting in lower income tax paid.\n\n## Product quality\n\nSignify is strongly committed to responsible product stewardship. The Signify quality management system is ISO 9001:2015 certified, covering all business activities. When it comes to quality, we believe prevention of defects is better than cure.\n\nThis is reflected in our structured approach towards the selection and qualification of suppliers, manufacturing, installation and delivery of our products and services. Additionally, our employees follow in-person or e-learning trainings on safety and quality. As an example, our research and development employees need to follow a mandatory training on Design for safety and this year, we launched safety awareness training for our business leaders across the organization.\n\nThe implementation of Advanced Quality methods is leading to higher maturity levels of products and services and consequently higher customer satisfaction.\n\nIn line with mandatory legislation all over the world, Signify is committed to placing only safe products on the market. In the event products have been brought to market that do not meet the essential safety requirements, Signify takes a systematic approach and appropriate actions, which might  include a product recall, especially in case the health and safety of individuals are of concern. Signify has a robust process in place to ensure impacted constituents are informed. In 2022, no product safety issues were found that resulted in a material fine or penalty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are focusing on improving our digital front and back-ends and increasing our data analytics capabilities to better serve our customers. In this context, it has been more important than ever to ensure that access to network, IT systems and data is assured at all times.\n\nSignify has a dedicated Corporate Security department which focuses on Information, Product and Operational security. Signify follows the three lines of defense model. The first line of defense is performed by IT, Business units and Security Operations. The second by the Corporate Security department and the third by our internal independent audit team. The responsibility of the Corporate Security Office, as a second line of defense, is assurance and control function (i.e., risk, compliance) that oversees security risk, sets the security controls framework and monitors the deployment of the controls within the first-line of defense (i.e., IT, Innovation, Business Units).\n\nWe have a Cybersecurity team that provides Threat Intelligence, Guidance and Assurance services, and Manufacturing Cybersecurity services. Our threat intelligence team has a defined process for gathering, analyzing, and distributing actionable intelligence on potential threats to Signify, and proactively alerts stakeholders. Our Guidance team is\n\nresponsible for providing security guidance through the development of Policies, Standards and Process Guidelines, and establishing an Enterprise Security Architecture to keep our digital identities, data and environment secure. Our Assurance team performs independent assessments and penetration testing activities to validate implementation of standards and assess residual risks and gaps. Our Manufacturing cybersecurity team provides guidance and assurance support to secure our Manufacturing and Operational Technology (OT) assets. Our security operation center is responsible for the detection, mitigation and resolution of cybersecurity-related incidents, enabling action to be taken in a timely manner. Technical security measures are implemented to support the 'defense in depth' principle, starting from the collection of information to infrastructure controls.\n\nOur cybersecurity requirements also apply to our external partners and suppliers as part of the security schedules and contracts signed to emphasize the adherence of security standards expected from them. Our cybersecurity processes and measures are based on ISO 27001 (Information security) and ISA/IEC 62443 (Product Security) certifications, as well as other related best practices (such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Center of Internet Security (CIS)).\n\nOur overall approach to Cybersecurity and prioritization of activities is risk-based, and we recognize identity as the perimeter to maintaining the required security. In addition to the guidance provided as part of the security standards and guidelines, we have set up a formal process that extends the\n\nreach of our cybersecurity services directly to business and IT stakeholders, and is available to clarify their questions and doubts about cybersecurity-related matters.\n\nFrom an awareness standpoint, all our employees are expected to complete a mandatory training on security every year, that includes a quiz to ascertain their understanding of the topics. Webinars are organized on topics of emerging cybersecurity threats and best practices to teach employees to avoid the risks of falling prey to them. Focused trainings are also conducted as required. Phishing simulations are regularly conducted on a monthly basis including for new hires. Dedicated learning pathways are created for those who fail the simulation tests.\n\nIn 2022, Security assessments were conducted to assess the risks in cloud environments and on-premise systems. Continual assessments for critical assets were conducted during the course of the year to ensure constant visibility to the risk of identity exposure. Security architecture and approach for Continual assurance and management of SaaS Security Posture, as well as Attack Surface Exposure Monitoring were developed. Security webinars were conducted to employees on topics including \"How to protect from Ransomware\", \"Emerging new tactics of Ransomware\", \"Phishing' and 'Information Protection- 101\". The Phishing, Ransomware and Insider Threats continue to be a challenge, as does balancing the need for improved security without impacting end-user experience. We are constantly trying to evolve and improve our cybersecurity guidance, alerting, monitoring and incident response\n\nmechanisms to manage these threats without causing disruptions to Signify businesses. In 2022, we conducted a cyber crisis tabletop exercise to understand and address gaps in our preparedness for a cyber crisis. We are actively planning to conduct more cyber drills at manufacturing sites and red teaming exercises to improve cyber incident resilience.\n\nAll cybersecurity activities are reported to and monitored by the Security Board, chaired by our Chief Executive Officer, Eric Rondolat. Other members of the Security Board are the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Security Officer, and the Heads of Internal Audit, Legal and Human Resources. The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board are informed regularly.\n\n## 16.3.7 Social impact of light\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Brighter lives revenues\n\nWe are driving change to create brighter futures. With our lighting innovations, we support the health and well-being of people, sustainable food production for a growing global population, and a safer and more secure society. We commit to double our Brighter lives revenues to 32% by the end of 2025, which means our revenues coming from lighting innovations that increase food availability, safety and security, or health and well-being. At the end of 2022, our Brighter lives revenues were 27% (2021: 25-27%). Through our actions, we directly contribute\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "to the achievement of SDG 3: Good health and well-being and SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities.\n\n## Health & well-being\n\nLight is essential for life, and equally important as food, water and air. Light allows us to see and to experience the world around us. It affects us visually, biologically and emotionally, supporting comfort, well-being and performance. Scientific evidence shows that light has a powerful impact on our emotions and important physiological and biological processes in our body. Circadian lighting in an office environment for instance makes an office more liveble and up to 12% more productive.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to focus on quality of light in our LED portfolio meeting the EyeComfort criteria which include factors that can impact the comfort of your eyes (such as flicker, stroboscopic or glare). We further expanded the EyeComfort in our LED lamps, Hue and WiZ portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also focused on Office and Healthcare applications, contributing to employees', patients' and staff's health and well-being. NatureConnect brings the benefits of natural light indoors. Based on the combined 2021\n\nresults of end-user surveys at different customer sites, 80% of the office workers confirmed that the lighting feels like daylight. \"I really feel like I'm outside\" is the most common reaction from customers.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic revealed that health and well-being are top priorities, and lighting can offer reliable disinfection through several UV-C applications. In 2022, our portfolio of new innovative solutions based on our UV-C offering was further extended to help create safe and healthy indoor spaces.\n\nThe risk of contracting and spreading viruses and bacteria increases in busy and public areas, such as offices, stores, schools, museums and public transport. In laboratory testing, our UV-C light sources inactivated 99% of the SARS-CoV-2 with an exposure time of six seconds.\n\n## Food availability\n\nTo meet the needs of a growing population, we need to consume resources more efficiently. Global food demand will rise by 70% by 2050, while 80% of arable land globally is already farmed. Many of the vegetables we consume are not produced locally and are transported over long distances. Approximately one-third of the world's available food is either spoiled or thrown away before it ever reaches a plate. Overall, the world's current food production and distribution systems contribute between 20% and 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions. To address these challenges, significant changes to our food systems are needed to ensure enough safe, healthy, accessible and affordable food for all in the (near) future.\n\nHorticulture LED technologies can provide an answer by realizing extremely efficient farming with high yields, efficient use of space and enabling local production, at least a 90% reduction in water use, and avoiding pollution from pesticides. With the right light spectrum and growth recipe, our lighting innovations give better control over climate and crops, and help to achieve high quality and yield at the right time. Our technology applies also to aquaculture, animal centric lighting and water and air purification.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety & security\n\nFor the past 10 years, lighting has gone through a significant technological transformation, opening new possibilities in using light. With increasing urbanization, street crime and traffic accidents are a real challenge. Interact-connected LED systems and management software improve city services and can help to reduce street crime and night-time traffic accidents, while reducing energy costs. Our connected LED systems also have applications for outdoor homes, enhancing feeling of safety and security.\n\nToday, more than 50 billion devices are connected to the Internet, most of them wirelessly. This is placing wireless\n\ncommunication under increasing pressure, and the radio spectrum is becoming congested. In addition, there are areas where radio frequency wireless communication is not permitted or the best fit. Trulifi by Signify offers a range of LiFi systems, providing a two-way wireless communication that is reliable, secure, and fast. Next to this, Trulifi is immune to any electromagnetic interference from, for example, industrial processes.\n\n## Access to light\n\nIn its fifth year of operations, the Signify Foundation remains committed to enabling access to the benefits of sustainable lighting for underserved communities.\n\nIn 2022, the Signify Foundation continued to focus on building recovery and resilience for underserved communities by enabling access to light and livelihood development. The Foundation has mainly supported two types of intervention: direct product placement and installation (Lighting lives and Humanitarian lighting projects), and competency build-up for last-mile distribution (Lighting entrepreneurs projects).\n\nIts work contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular to SDG 5: Gender equality, SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy, SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth, and SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities. Projects supported by the combined resources of Signify and the Foundation have lit 8.3 million lives in communities around the globe and supported 12,043 lighting entrepreneurs (baseline 2017).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Signify Foundation redoubled its efforts to provide relief for displaced people with its Humanitarian lighting program. Bringing lighting to displaced people increases the safety and security of vulnerable communities, and can contribute to people's overall sense of dignity.\n\nFrom the beginning of the the Russia-Ukraine war in February 2022, the Signify Foundation activated its humanitarian aid protocol to provide emergency lighting to shelters and households. The first batch of 952 portable lights arrived in Lviv on March 5, followed by larger volumes. In total, more than 35,000 lights were sent to aid agencies: the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), European Food Bank, and Global Medic in Ukraine and Poland. Signify has made a financial commitment of EUR 800,000 in funding to support immediate and medium-term needs. Signify employees have also been supportive, from teams in neighboring countries arranging transfers, meals, and accommodation, to the many employees around the globe offering donations directly to the Foundation's relief efforts.\n\ncredits: Global Medic\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lighting entrepreneurs\n\nThrough its Lighting entrepreneurs programs, the Signify Foundation supports local capacity building, with a focus on business and technical skills, to develop sustainable communities and livelihoods. This support focuses on empowering people who currently lack access to formal employment, particularly youth and women, and who are motivated to start their own clean energy businesses.\n\nSince 2021, the Signify Foundation has supported the development of women entrepreneurs in Senegal with ElleSolaire. Grant support enables this unique womenled, community participatory distribution model to scale. The project supports women entrepreneurs to work together towards self-reliance, professional inclusion, and the sustainable alleviation of energy poverty.\n\ncredits: ElleSolaire\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Lighting lives\n\nThe Lighting lives program aims to create long-lasting impact on people's lives. Lighting interventions designed in collaboration with local groups and aid agencies have made a positive impact on communities, providing better access to health care, essential services, sports, and productivity. In 2022, the Foundation partnered with a local NGO Beyond the Goal Post and Signify's Ghana office to provide lighting to off-grid villages in Ghana's Southeast and Northern regions. Solar streetlights and poles were transported by boat to these remote villages. The new lights shine through the evenings to safeguard people, especially children, women, and elderly people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough the Foundation and Signify's continued efforts, we are on track in our efforts to reach our target of lighting 10 million lives by the end of 2025.

        "page_content": "## 16.4 Better World\n\nMaurice Loosschilder Head of Sustainability, Signify\n\n'Our world is faced with a rapidly warming climate and an energy crisis that is now truly global. There has never been a more urgent need for efficient solutions that reduce the amount of energy we consume. If we want to live in a carbon-neutral world in 2050, at least half of the change we need to make will come from reducing our energy consumption. Lighting makes up 12% of global electricity usage. It is encouraging to me that within this domain, the transition is fast, accessible, and entirely within our reach.\n\nSignify's Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program aims to double our positive impact on the environment, bringing us all a step closer to this brighter future. In the past decade, we have reduced our operational carbon footprint by more than 70%. We remain carbon neutral in our global operations and use 100% renewable electricity. In the past year, we have ramped up our efforts not just in our operations, but across our entire\n\nvalue chain, to minimize the impact of climate change and accelerate the transition to a circular economy. In line with our commitment to SDG 13: Climate action and SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy, we aim to double the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C scenario to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over our full value chain by the end of 2025. And on SDG12: Responsible consumption and production, our goal is to double our revenues from circular products, systems, and services by the end of 2025. Both commitments were on track at the end of 2022.\n\nAs the global sustainability leader in lighting, our impact as an environmentally responsible organization is at the very heart of our company strategy. Changing how we run our company is a key driver of our growth. It also represents a commitment to working with our clients and our partners, whether they are corporations, governments, educational institutions, or consumers, to make the lighting industry a force for positive environmental change.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 16.4.1 Climate action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate leadership\n\nAt Signify, we acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and believe we have an important role to play in the transformation towards a lowcarbon economy, with deep decarbonization across our value chain. In 2019, Signify was one of the first 30 companies committing to verified Science-Based Targets in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C pathway, to cut GHG emissions in our operations as well as in our value chain. We commit to reduce 70% of absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and 30% of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 2030 (baseline 2015). At the end of 2022, we achieved:\n\n- \u00b7 57% reduction of absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions (baseline 2015).\n- \u00b7 On track towards our reduction target of absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products (baseline 2015).\n\nIn 2022, Signify was again recognized in CDP's Climate A list for our leadership in environmental performance and we were included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the sixth consecutive year. We continued to partner with the Climate Group's EV100 Initiative to operate a lease fleet of hybrid and fully electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. We remain engaged in the AndersReizen Dutch Business Sustainable Mobility Pledge to further improve the sustainability performance of our business travel.\n\nThrough our partnership with the RE100 Initiative, we shifted to 100% renewable electricity use since 2020. As an active member of Clean Cargo and the WBCSD Transforming Heavy Transport project, we engage in cross-industry collaboration and strive to lower the carbon footprint of our freight transport. We renewed our partnership with Maersk, one of our key partners in ocean freight, and supported them in launching new vessels that operate on zero-carbon fuels. These partnerships will help us to scale zero carbon solutions in our supply chain and logistics operations. Our continuous pledge to the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings commitment facilitates improvement in energy efficiency as well as reduction in electricity consumption in our non-industrial buildings.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our efforts to align with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations to further assess our climate-related risks and opportunities via our internal cross-department task force. As a result, we refined our climate risk mitigation and adaptation strategy. For more information, please refer to our TCFD reporting in the Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report.\n\nAll our environmental policies and our management framework are based on the international ISO 14001 standard. In 2022, 70% of our manufacturing sites were ISO 14001 certified.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Double the pace of the Paris Agreement\n\nIn our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we go beyond carbon neutrality and commit to doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C scenario to decarbonize our entire value chain. This means we aim to achieve the emission reduction goals laid out in the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C pathway for 2031 by 2025, six years early.\n\nBy the end of 2025, we will reduce our scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 40% compared to our 2019 baseline year. As shown in the graph, 97% of our value-chain emissions lies in the product use phase. By offering energyefficient products, we help our customers reduce millions of tonnes of CO 2 e.\n\n## Doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement\n\nAt the end of 2022, the total avoided emissions achieved through our LED technology sales (compared to Conventional technology) was 21 million tonnes CO 2 e.\n\nWe are on track to deliver against our ambitious goal of doubling the pace of the Paris Agreement's 1.5 \u00ba scenario. This reduction is mainly due to the increased share of sales of energy-efficient and connected LED lighting which drives emissions reduction in the use phase.\n\nReporting emissions across the value chain is still a niche practice where Signify is making significant progress. We continue working on improving the availability of the data used and have the ambition to include additional scope 3 data in next year's report. For more details on our approach, please refer to our Sustainability Supplements to the Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Signify footprint over its value chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Operations (Scope 1, 2, Logistics,\n\nBusiness travel)\n\nScope 3 suppliers\n\nScope 3 use of sold products\n\n- Scope 3 end-of-life\n\n## Carbon neutral in our operations\n\nTo combat climate change, we believe we have a responsibility to take climate action in the best way we can. For Signify, this means decarbonizing our own operations, and in addition, enabling our entire value chain and the society to accelerate climate action. Signify has reduced more than 70% of its absolute operational carbon footprint since 2010, and continues to do so, via hundreds of initiatives implemented in factories, offices, logistics, and business travel.\n\nSince September 2020, we run carbon neutral operations around the globe, which means GHG emissions from our manufacturing facilities (scope 1 and 2), non-industrial locations (scope 1 and 2), upstream and downstream logistics activities (scope 3), and business travel (scope 3) are all carbon neutral. We continue sourcing 100%\n\nrenewable electricity in our global operations, contributing to the green energy transition.\n\nIn 2022, total gross GHG emissions were 252 kilotonnes (2021: 290), a 13% decrease yearon-year and a 77% reduction compared to 2010. This decrease can be explained by significant emission reductions from air transport as well as energy saving in operations. Our operational emission intensity in tonnes of CO 2 e per million-euro sales was 34 in 2022 (2021: 42).\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we still have unavoidable residual emissions, such as emissions from the use of natural gas in industrial processes. To fulfill our carbon neutral commitment, we invest in certified carbon offsetting projects.\n\nCarbon offsetting is not part of our emission reduction strategy; instead, we invest in high quality carbon offsetting projects to only offset our unavoidable residual emissions. By doing so, we also enable actors in and out of our value chain to take action and cut their emissions. Carbon neutrality is not our end goal, it is how we choose to operate in addition to the 70% emission reduction already achieved. Carbon offsetting is only the last piece of the carbon neutrality puzzle.\n\nIn 2022, we offset 252 kilotonnes of CO 2 e via carbon credits (2021: 290), resulting in a net operational carbon footprint of 0 (2021: 0).\n\nAll used carbon credits have been certified by the Verra, Verra Climate, Community, and Biodiversity (CCB) Standards and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Verra's diligence and transparency are underpinned by its fully publicly available Registry System.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is a decrease of 9% compared to 2021. In 2022, we continued to lead operational changes and efficiency improvements, which resulted in less energy intensive activities and less energy consumption.\n\n## Non-industrial operations\n\nIn 2022, GHG emissions from non-industrial operations (offices, warehouses) represented 6% of our total operational carbon footprint. In 2022, our emissions from non-industrial operations increased by 8 kilotonnes compared to 2021 due to increased energy consumption in offices.\n\n## Logistics\n\nIn 2022, 34% of our total GHG emissions in our operations were attributed to logistics, and our total emissions from logistics decreased by 30% compared to 2021. This is a result of the improved sustainable logistics operations, such as reducing reliance on emission-intensive mode of transport - air transport.\n\n## Business travel\n\nIn 2022, our GHG emissions related to business travel accounted for 4% of our operational carbon footprint. Our absolute emissions from business travel remained at a low level despite an increase compared to 2021 due to loosened COVID constraints and recovery of business activities.\n\n## Energy use in operations\n\nOur total energy usage in 2022 amounted to 3,811 terajoules. Our operational energy intensity in terajoules per million-euro sales was 0.51 in 2022. This is 4% more efficient than 2021 (0.53) and is due to operational optimization, improved energy efficiency, less reliance on energy-intensive activities in our factories and reduced heating and lighting requirements.\n\n## Electricity\n\nIn 2022, we procured 100% of our electricity from renewable sources. This achievement directly contributes to SDG 7: Clean and affordable energy. All electricity consumed by our operations worldwide was sourced from renewable sources or matched with Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Approximately 6% of our renewable electricity was contracted via our energy providers, 52% was sourced through the procurement of renewable energy certificates, and 42% came from our participation in two Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) in the US and Poland. Our PPAs contribute to the transition to more sustainable electricity grids and reinforce our long-term commitment to using renewable electricity. In 2020, we signed the first pan European PPA, which will power European operations with green electricity from 2023 onwards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As mentioned previously, the majority of our value-chain emissions lies in the product use phase. Helping our customers to reduce emissions through energy efficiency is a vital aspect of our innovation process.\n\nSignify is committed to reduce GHG emissions by improving the energy efficiency of its products, systems, and services. Our target is to grow our Climate action revenues to 72% by the end of 2025.\n\nTo define which revenues contribute to climate action, we set the ambitious threshold of products with a luminous efficacy of 80 lm/W or more, depending of the lumen output. Climate action revenues are measured as a percentage of the total revenues per product family and tracked for each Division.\n\nAt the end of 2022, 65% of our revenues contributed to climate action (2021:61-64%)\n\nBy delivering cleaner and more energyefficient solutions, we are proud to contribute to the achievement of SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Philips A-class LED tube\n\nIn 2021, Signify broke new ground with the launch of the Philips LED A-class bulb, which consumes 60% less energy than a standard Philips LED. In 2022, the MASTER LEDtube UltraEfficient continues this technological innovation to expand the portfolio of energy-efficient products, which meet the A-class criteria of the new EU energy labeling and ecodesign framework. Under these updated rules, lighting products need energy efficiency of at least 210 lm/W to be rated A-class, the highest rating.\n\n## Enabling carbon reduction at our suppliers\n\nIn 2022, we continued to engage with our suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint. Our approach is to proactively initiate, develop and support GHG emission-reduction activities at suppliers through our partnership with the CDP Supply Chain program. In 2022, we invited 501 (2021: 698) of our strategic suppliers to the program, of which 70% submitted the 2022 CDP questionnaire.\n\nIn 2022, 263 suppliers reported emissionreduction activities (2021: 269). 107 suppliers reported that their emissions decreased compared to the previous reporting year, 31% of suppliers reported renewable energy usage, and 36% suppliers engaged their own suppliers to reduce emissions. We increased the number of suppliers committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative to 103 (2021: 46) and we increased the number of suppliers that have a RE100 program from 5 in 2021 to 14 in 2022.\n\nWe are developing a more accurate method to calculate scope 3 GHG emission in the supply base. At the end of 2022, we estimated that 24 million metric tons carbon of CO 2 e were saved in our supply base (2021: 39 million metric tons).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Setting Science-Based Targets in China\n\nSignify was one of the first CDP Supply Chain members to start engaging Chinese suppliers on the importance to set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to reduce GHG emissions. We nominated four of our high-impact China-based suppliers, of which two have now formally signed the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) commitment letter. In a dedicated webinar to our suppliers, we explained how science-based target setting plays an important role in suppliers' evaluation. Once suppliers have formally committed to the SBTi, an emission calculation tool was provided to them to help the establishment of accurate emission rates. Our collaboration with CDP was key to support our suppliers and monitor their progress and progress reports were shared at management level, to initiate\n\nactions where needed.",

At Signify, we identified five strategic areas where we will grow our business while furthering our contribution to a better and more sustainable world. These five growth areas are defined based on the major trends facing society, and on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. One of these growth areas is Circular economy.\n\nAs the world continues to overuse its limited resources, scarce materials will become more challenging to source. We need to do better, and we believe that the transition to a circular economy is instrumental.\n\nWith circular lighting solutions we can preserve value and avoid waste. That is why, as part of our Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 sustainability program, we have the ambition to double our revenues from circular products, systems, and services to 32% by the end of 2025.\n\nAdditionally, we are committed to more sustainable packaging, removing plastics from all our consumer packaging in 2023, and to sending zero waste to landfill.\n\nOur actions cover the entire life cycle of a product (from production, use and re-use to waste management) and directly contribute to the achievement of SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production.\n\n## Circular lighting portfolio\n\nIn our efforts to transition to a circular economy, we extended our circular lighting portfolio in 2022. Via well-established sustainable design rules, Signify continuously lowers the weight of new product designs, resulting in less material use and costs for our product portfolio. The sustainable design rules are also optimized for circularity, resulting in products that can be upgraded, serviced, reused, refurbished, or recycled. In 2022, we launched our lighting for circularity website to provide more insights on our products, systems and services designed for a circular economy: https://www.signify.com/ global/sustainability/lighting-for-circularity.\n\nOur circular innovations cover four categories: Serviceable luminaires, Circular components, Intelligent asset management, and Circular services.\n\nServiceable luminaires are fixtures that are upgradable, serviceable, connectable, energy-efficient, reusable, and recyclable. In 2022, we launched the StoreSet linear product, designed to reuse existing infrastructure in place. This new range of track-based luminaires can easily be serviced, since all components can be replaced without tools, enabling maintenance or upgrading to meet the emerging needs of customers. Instead of replacing the whole luminaire, modules can be exchanged preserving value and avoiding waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAnother example of serviceable luminaires is our 3D printed luminaires, designed in a modular way and easily upgradable. Our Coastal Breeze collection is 3D printed using discarded fishing nets for cleaner oceans and a low carbon footprint. In 2022, the 3Dprinted Coastal Breeze pendant lamp won the prestigious Gold IDEA 2022 design award and received an honorable mention in the Fast Company Innovation by Design awards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Signify connected systems tell us exactly when and where to perform maintenance, cutting down on waste, costs, downtime, and manpower.\n\nCircular services aim at prolonging lifetimes and provide customers with services that combine lighting design, installation and maintenance in a single contract.\n\nWe closely monitor and report the progress of the circular portfolio contribution, and at the end of 2022, 29% of our revenues came from circular products, systems or services (2021: 21-25%).\n\nOur efforts also address supply chain improvements, such as remote serviceability (connected lighting) and end-of-life services. By minimizing material waste and reducing the environmental impact, we create an ecosystem that extends the life of our lighting products and provides a better future for the next generation.\n\n## Zero Waste to landfill\n\nWe are committed to send zero manufacturing waste to landfill and keep the recycle rate as high as possible.\n\nIn 2022, our focus has been on driving continuous improvements and process optimization across the globe. At the end of the year, Signify was sending zero waste to landfill according to its commitment and only one site from a recent acquisition was still transitioning to reach this status.\n\nWe improved our practices regarding waste segregation, waste awareness training and sharing best practices across regions. In 2022, Signify registered 1.61 kilotonnes of hazardous waste (2021: 1.96 kilotonnes), of which 53% was recycled. We will continue our efforts to reduce our hazardous waste by 5% annually.\n\nOur recycling programs address waste arising from manufacturing activities, such as glass or canteen waste, as well as from suppliers, such as packaging materials. 89% of total waste was recycled in 2022 and we continued to recycle 100% of our metal and glass waste.\n\nTotal manufacturing waste consists of waste that is delivered for recycling, incineration or landfill.

Our packaging policy encourages packaging designers, procurement and suppliers to minimize the environmental impact of packaging materials in all phases of the life cycle. This means reducing the amount of packaging used, selecting packaging materials with a high recycled content, and/ or selecting virgin packaging materials with a minimal environmental impact from responsible sources. Our packaging policy requires the use of 80% recycled paper, and\n\nup to 50% of recycled content when PET plastic is used.\n\nIn 2019, we started our journey to phase out all plastic packaging material from our consumer portfolio globally. At the end of 2020, all new LED lamps packaging in Europe shifted from blister to paper boxes. In 2021 and 2022, we progressed further by replacing remaining plastic applications, such as plastic bags, protective films, plastic caps, cable binders, tape and stickers. And by the end of 2022, our consumer packaging was plastic-free in all our markets except in China for two product lines, which we plan to make plastic-free in 2023.\n\nWe calculated at the beginning of our journey, based on our 2020 portfolio, that through",

This is the equivalent of the GHG emissions that 270,000 fully-grown trees can absorb in a year.\n\n## 16.4.4 Hazardous substances\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Product substances\n\nThrough sustainable design rules, all new product developments meet stringent sustainability criteria before their market launch. All our products and systems delivered to countries requiring the CE marking are compliant with the RoHS Directive (2011/65/ EU) and REACH (EC 1907/2006) Regulation. We require all our suppliers to communicate all substances in their components and to comply with the stipulations that we have listed in our Regulated Substance List (RSL), which in many cases goes beyond legislation. In 2022, we continued to engage with our suppliers, further rolling out the publicly available BOMcheck tool, in which components and substances can be registered.\n\n## Chemical substances in production processes\n\nWe prioritize the safe management of chemicals to ensure that we minimize the risks of the use of these substances related to the environment, society and our employees in their daily work. If there are threats of harm to human safety or the environment, we proactively search for effective alternatives. We have a robust approach to identify and manage regulated and hazardous substances in our production processes.\n\nWe ensure compliance through continuous monitoring of chemical usage in manufacturing sites and have been actively phasing out several hazardous substances.\n\n## Emissions from mercury\n\nThe target to achieve emissions As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) was met in 2015 and we continue to closely monitor usage, emissions and exposure and drive further improvement where possible. For instance, since 2012 the emissions from mercury drastically decreased by changing our production processes and replacing liquid mercury with solid-state mercury.\n\nAdditionally, with the transition from conventional lighting to LED lighting, it is expected that the use of mercury will remain at a very low level or 0 in the coming years.\n\n## Emissions from mercury in kilograms\n\n|                    | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mercury and        |        |        |        |\n| mercury  compounds | 0.01   | 0      | 0      |\n\nIn 2022, emissions from mercury and mercury compounds totalled 0 kilogram.\n\n## Emissions from volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in lacquering processes\n\nFor years, Signify has been focusing on improving its operations relating to the coating of products to reduce the use of targeted VOCs. In 2022, we continued the shift from chemical painting to water-based paint and powder coating process.\n\nDue to the progressive replacement of coil ballasts with electronic ballasts and the closure of production lines, styrene emissions have been eliminated since 2020.\n\n## Emissions of VOCs in lacquering processes\n\n|                          | 2020   | 2021         |   2022 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------------|--------|\n| Lead and lead  compounds | -      | 0            |    0   |\n| Styrene                  | 0      | 0            |    0   |\n| Toluene                  | 37     | 1.2          |    1.2 |\n| Xylene                   |        | 767    822.3 |  717.2 |\n\n## 16.4.5 Water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignify recognizes the growing importance of water usage in our everyday activities. As we continue to expand our portfolio of LED products, systems, and services, the water intensity of our operations continues to decrease. Despite this, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas with water stress, such as Saudi Arabia,\n\nMexico and parts of the United States, and might face water scarcity risks. To analyze and quantify our exposure to water risk, we utilized the open-source Water Risk Monetizer tool by Ecolab, Trucost, and Microsoft. The results show that 19% of our global water consumption is located in regions classified as having high-water scarcity (2021:23%).\n\nWhile some of our facilities have reuse and recycling measures in place, we continued to implement and identify new and more efficient water saving measures as well as continuing our transition to technology and business models that have a lower dependency on water. We aim to reduce our water usage by 5% annually.\n\nTotal water intake in 2022 was 1,163,961 m 3 , 19% lower than 2021 (1,432,000 m 3 ). This decrease was partly due to the closure of three sites in 2022.\n\n61% of our water intake is used for domestic purposes.\n\n## Water intake in thousands of m 3\n\n|             | 2020   | 2021         | 2022   |\n|-------------|--------|--------------|--------|\n| Total water |        | 971    1,432 | 1,164  |\n\nBased on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we caused EUR 3 million in costs to society through our water usage.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the last years, biodiversity protection has gained significant importance, and different frameworks are being released about the subject. The result of our materiality assessment shows that biodiversity is gaining importance.\n\nWe acknowledge that it is our responsibility to identify our negative and positive impacts and to take action for biodiversity conservation. In 2022, Signify organized a workshop involving strategic internal stakeholders and external expert to discuss our impact on biodiversity at distinct levels (supply chain, operations, and in the use phase). Thanks to the workshop, we were able to further assess our impacts and define the next steps towards our Biodiversity Roadmap 2025.\n\nSignify follows international standards ISO 14001 which helps us to monitor and minimize the negatives impact in the local environment and consequentially on biodiversity.\n\nIn 2022, we re-performed the assessment started in 2021 to identify the potential presence of manufacturing sites in key biodiversity areas or protected areas using the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT). Key biodiversity areas are sites contributing significantly to the global\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental incidents\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, Signify experienced no significant environmental incidents.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npersistence of biodiversity. Protected areas are classified according to their management objectives, and examples of protected areas are strict nature reserve, wilderness area, or protected landscape (source: International Union for Conservation of Nature). Signify uses a total of 175 hectares of land for its manufacturing activities and in 2022, none of our manufacturing sites were located in a protected or a key biodiversity area. We also deepened our assessment by interviewing eleven sites located at a distance of two kilometers or less from these areas. We evaluated our potential negative impact on land, soil, water and air using the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) beta framework. Considering the individualities of each site, it was possible to identify that no further mitigation actions were necessary at the moment.\n\nDetailed impact assessment in our supply chain and use phase is part of our biodiversity roadmap towards 2025. We have already identified that potential negative impacts in our supply chain might be related to mining activities in our supply base. Also, poor quality lighting can increase light pollution and sky glow and as a consequence can negatively impact biodiversity in the use phase.\n\nTo mitigate potential negative impact on biodiversity, we already have processes and activities in place such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Our sustainable supply chain program which covers, besides other points, environmental impact and management systems in our supply base.\n- \u00b7 Our sustainable packaging requirements, which stand against deforestation of natural forests and habitats and promote the use of sustainable materials.\n- \u00b7 Our plastic-free packaging achievement in consumer related products, which contributes to less plastic pollution in nature and oceans.\n- \u00b7 Our horticulture lighting portfolio, which contributes to vertical farming to increase food production while decreasing land use and the use of fertilizers and pesticides.\n- \u00b7 Our light spectrum, which helps maintaining balanced ecosystem by displaying minimal attraction for insects, enabling bats to behave the same way as if it was full darkness and preventing lit roads from acting as borders or obstacles to be crossed at night.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to contribute to conserving and restoring forests. For example, our project in Belize ensures that more than 565 hectares of forest and wildlife in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor are preserved. The Rio Anapu-Pacaja REDD Carbon Credit Project in Portel, Para is protecting 165,707 hectares in a highly critical region of the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nBased on our methodology for calculating societal impact, we created EUR 73 million for society through conserving and preserving forests in 2022.",

At Signify, we want to be a catalyst for change, and are committed to doubling our positive impact on the environment and society. We continuously seek opportunities to increase transparency and showcase our leadership.\n\n## The EU Taxonomy reporting framework and requirements\n\nTo define what is \"sustainable\", the European Commission has developed a catalog of economic activities, each with criteria to determine if they substantially contribute towards a sustainable economy - known as the EU Taxonomy. Companies across diverse sectors, supply chains, and asset classes must use this classification system to assess if their business activities are sustainable. In June 2021, the Commission formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act, establishing the criteria defining which activities substantially contribute to the first two, out of six, environmental objectives of the Taxonomy regulation. For its financial year 2022, Signify discloses eligibility and alignment on the first two environmental objectives, climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\n## Signify's economic activities\n\nThe currently available definitions as included in the Taxonomy are broadly formulated which leads to companies including Signify having to interpret how this applies to their business activities. We applied judgment, interpretations and assumptions based on currently available information. Future guidance could result in more accurate\n\ndefinitions and other decision-making in meeting reporting obligations, which could impact our future Taxonomy reporting.\n\nThe analysis of Signify's economic activities in the context of the EU Taxonomy has revealed the following lighting specific activities that contribute specifically to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation.\n\n- \u00b7 3.5 Manufacture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings. We allocate manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies for Indoor spaces to this economic activity.\n- \u00b7 3.6 Manufacture other low carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy. We allocate manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies for Outdoor spaces to this economic activity.\n- \u00b7 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment. We allocate installation, maintenance and repair activities of lighting products such as lamps and luminaires, without controls, for indoor spaces to this economic activity.\n- \u00b7 7.5 Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings. We allocate installation, maintenance and repair activities of lighting systems, such as luminaires with control modules, for indoor spaces to this economic activity. The system might also include sensors, triggers, software, on-site or cloud connectivity.\n\nThe analysis of the economic activities in the context of the EU Taxonomy has not revealed any activities that contribute specifically to the environmental objective of climate change adaptation.\n\n## Signify's 2022 assessment\n\nThe EU Taxonomy defines Turnover, Capital Expenditure (CapEx) and Operating Expenditure (OpEx) as the key performance indicators that must be reported on. The financial figures relevant for Signify's EU Taxonomy reporting are based on the IFRS consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2022. Signify has compiled the financial figures based on the lighting technology, whereby LED and connected lighting are included, and conventional lighting is excluded. Allocation formulas have been used for CapEx and OpEx. If possible, figures have been directly assigned to an economic activity.\n\n## Turnover\n\nThe EU Taxonomy regulation describes the eligible turnover as the part of the net turnover derived from products or services, including intangibles, associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. An economic activity is considered Taxonomyeligible if it is listed in the EU Taxonomy delegated acts. The following list sets out Signify's Taxonomy-eligible turnover, contributing to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation:\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue of the manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies, for Indoor spaces (3.5) and Outdoor spaces (3.6);\n- \u00b7 Revenue of the installation, maintenance and repair of energy-efficient lighting, without controls (7.3) and with control modules (7.5).\n\nThis resulted in EUR 6,242 million of Taxonomy-eligible turnover (A.1+A.2, see graph) in 2022. Of the Taxonomy-eligible turnover, EUR 826 million met the screening criteria used to measure the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation (A.1). This includes our products in the\n\nhighest two populated classes of energy efficiency in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/1369; automation and controls systems and sensors; outdoor luminaires aimed at demonstrating substantial life-cycle GHG emission savings quantified by an external third party with verification due in 2023; and the installation, maintenance and repair of energy-efficient light sources and lighting control systems. When data requirements for alignment reporting are not met, the associated revenues have not been considered as aligned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSignify uses the European Product Registry for Energy Labelling (EPREL) as the starting point for determining the highest two populated classes, as required. For product groups that are incomplete or misleading in EPREL, we looked at our portfolio's energy labels distribution. As a conclusion, Signify defines the highest two populated classes as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 A & B classes for lamps and consumer luminaires.\n- \u00b7 C & D classes (on luminaire level) for professional indoor luminaires.\n- \u00b7 E & F classes for color controllable lamps.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Taxonomy-eligible economic activities.\n- \u00b7 Part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activities or to allow Taxonomyeligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned.\n- \u00b7 Related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures.\n\nThe following list sets out Signify's Taxonomyeligible CapEx contributing to the environmental objective of climate change mitigation:\n\n- \u00b7 CapEx related the manufacturing of LED and Connected technologies, for Indoor spaces (3.5) and Outdoor spaces (3.6), and the annual revenue of the installation, maintenance and repair of energy-efficient lighting, without controls (7.3) and with control modules (7.5).\n- \u00b7 CapEx related to expand these Taxonomyeligible economic activities, as well as expenditures that will allow non-eligible activities to become Taxonomy-eligible (i.e., new production lines and extension of production capacity of LED and Connected technologies).\n- \u00b7 CapEx related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures (i.e. freight vehicles and company cars acquired or taken as a lease, lease contracts for new or renovated buildings, energy efficiency improvement measures in buildings, purchase of energy-efficient equipment for buildings, solar panels installation,\n\nmaintenance and repair, and data processing, hosting and related activities).\n\nOf the Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures of EUR 198 million (A.1+A.2), Signify used the Taxonomy-aligned turnover proportion per business unit

        "page_content": "## Do No Significant Harm criteria\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation establishes that an economic activity must Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) to any of the other environmental objectives. To determine whether there was any substantial harm to the other environmental objectives of the Taxonomy (see below), we have gathered information about our measurements, processes and policies for each of the DNSH criteria covering the economic activities 3.5, 3.6, 7.3 and 7.5. The assessment confirmed that we meet the requirements of the DNSH criteria.\n\n## DNSH to Climate change adaptation\n\nWe performed a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to identify potential physical and transition risks in our value chain (upstream and downstream). Regarding the physical risks, we have analyzed all the climaterelated hazards listed in appendix A from Annex 1 of the EU Taxonomy and focused on assessing physical risks relevant to Signify's manufacturing sites, warehouses and distribution centers, namely riverine flooding, coastal flooding, drought, tropical storm, and heatwave for the short-term (2025) and two long-term (2050) scenarios. The two longterm scenarios cover below 2\u00b0C or SSP1-2.6 scenario - taking the sustainable road, and an above 4\u00b0C or SSP5-8.5 scenario - fossil fueled development path. In the 2022 assessment, no material risks have been identified. For more details on our Climate risk and vulnerability assessment, please refer to our TCFD reporting in the Sustainability Supplements to the 2022 Annual Report.\n\n## DNSH to Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n\nFor all our operations, Signify follows the local environmental regulation and has developed local studies about water impact when relevant based on the sites' operation and location. We operate in accordance with the international standards ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, as stipulated in our EHS Policy. The assessment confirmed that we meet the requirements of the DNSH criteria. For more information about water management, please refer the sub-section 16.4.4, Water.\n\n## DNSH to Transition to a circular economy\n\nOur Circular economy growth area, part of Signify's 5 Frontiers strategy, focuses on developing lighting products, systems and services that can be repaired, refurbished, reused or recycled, and have high durability with the aim to preserve value and avoid waste. We are sending zero manufacturing waste to landfill since 2020. Our Sustainability Policy reinforces our commitment to shift to a more circular economy with responsible consumption and production in mind. Our Sustainable Design Procedure is a mandatory procedure for all Signify R&D organizations and business and aims to further improve the sustainability performance and benefits of our portfolio. With other companies in the European lighting market, Signify founded the Collection and Recycling Service Organizations (CRSOs) to establish a dedicated infrastructure for the collection and recycling of conventional lamps, LED, and (LED) luminaires. Through our commitments, procedures and current activities, Signify\n\nmitigates the risk of harming the objective of transitioning to a circular economy. For more information about our actions towards a circular economy, please refer to subsection 16.4.2, Circular economy.\n\n## DNSH to Pollution prevention and control\n\nSignify has a strict policy towards pollution and prevention control. We control the use and disposal of all raw materials necessary for our operations, following all the local regulations. Signify requires all its suppliers to communicate all substances in their components and to comply with the stipulations that we have listed in our Regulated Substance List (RSL). For more information about pollution and prevention control, please refer to sub-section 16.4.4, Hazardous Substances.\n\n## DNSH to Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nSignify recognizes the value of preserving ecosystems and biodiversity. In all our operations, we follow at minimum local environmental regulations. To assess our impact on sensitive areas, Signify developed a screening process and concluded that none of our sites are located in Key Biodiversity Areas or Protected Areas. For sites near biodiversity-sensitive areas, we concluded that no further mitigations actions are required. For more information about biodiversity and ecosystems, please refer to sub-section 16.4.6 Biodiversity.\n\n## Minimum Social Safeguards\n\nThe Minimum Social Safeguards (MSS) provision of the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires companies involved in environmentally sustainable activities to\n\nrespect basic human rights and follow good business conduct rules. Environmentally sustainable economic activities must also meet criteria for responsible business conduct already outlined in the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the International Bill of Human Rights. We assessed the coverage of our codes and standards to the principles and policies under the MSS of the EU Taxonomy. Based on Signify's interpretation of the guidance on MSS, the assessment confirmed that we meet the requirements of the MSS criteria. In addition, the company is committed to a continuous improvement of its human and labor rights performance.\n\n## Complementary information\n\nA full reconciliation was made to the total reported turnover, CapEx and OpEx information to avoid double counting in the allocation of the numerators. The detailed results following the format of the Taxonomy Regulation can be found in the following pages. Signify understands and appreciates the fact that the EU Taxonomy framework is in constant evolution, and that the company's reporting obligations will continue to grow and evolve over the next years. Assessment of the 2022 results are pending further EU Taxonomy's market practice and comparability. Signify is committed to increasing its taxonomy-eligibility and taxonomy-alignment percentages independently of regulatory developments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Signify N.V. as at December 31, 2022, and of its result and its cash flows for 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EUIFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n- \u00b7 The accompanying company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of Signify N.V. as at December 31, 2022, and of its result for 2022 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nWe have audited the sustainability information in the Annual Report 2022 of Signify N.V. based in Eindhoven, the Netherlands (hereafter: the Annual Report). The scope is described in the section Our Scope of our report. This audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nIn our opinion, the sustainability information presents, in all material respects, a reliable and adequate view of:\n\n- \u00b7 The policy and business operations with regard to sustainability.\n- \u00b7 The thereto related events and achievements in 2022.\n\nin accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) and the applied supplemental reporting criteria as disclosed in chapter 16, Sustainability statements, section 16.1, Approach to sustainability reporting.\n\n## Basis for our opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the sustainability information in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing and the Dutch Standard 3810N 'Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports' respectively, which is a specified Dutch standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, 'Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section Our responsibilities of our report.\n\nWe believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe are independent of Signify N.V. in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties, (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\n## Our scope\n\n## Our engagements scope\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 The following statements for 2022: the consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity.\n- \u00b7 The notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nThe company financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The company balance sheet as at December 31, 2022.\n- \u00b7 The company profit and loss account for 2022\n- \u00b7 The notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nThe sustainability information is included in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, sections 3.2, Our impact and 3.3, Our value created, chapter 4, Corporate performance, section 4.2, Sustainability performance, and chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sections 16.1 to\n\n16.4, excluding section Responsible Tax Policy, as included in sub-section 16.3.5, Business Ethics.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our audit engagement on the sustainability information\n\nThe sustainability information includes prospective information, such as goals, strategy, plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates. Inherent to this prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the sustainability information.\n\nWith regards to the Company's sustainability information, the 2019 baseline is based on Signify's best estimates available at the time of start of the Brighter Lives, Better World 2025 doubling commitments in 2021. Furthermore, Signify is making progress, but still working on further improvements on both availability and accuracy of the data used in its sustainability reporting. Therefore, neither the 2019 baseline assumptions, nor the 'Double the pace' of the Paris Agreement are included in the scope of our audit engagement of the sustainability information. We refer to chapter 16, Sustainability statements, sub-section 16.4.1, Climate action, for more information.\n\nCalculations to determine societal impact as included in chapter 3, Creating long-term value, section 3.3, Our value created, are mostly based on external sources and by using several assumptions. The assumptions and sources used are explained in the\n\ndocument 'Methodology for societal impact calculations' and the 'Supplement to the 2022 Sustainability statements' as available on the website of Signify N.V.. We have not performed procedures on the assumptions or external sources, other than evaluating the suitability of these assumptions and external sources used.\n\nThe references to external sources or websites in the sustainability information are not part of the sustainability information as audited by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the Annual Report are described in the section Our opinions of our report.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure sustainability information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the sustainability information needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.\n\n## Information in support of our opinions\n\nWe designed our audit procedures in the context of both our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the sustainability information as a whole and in forming our opinions thereon. The following information in support of our opinions and any findings were addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Our understanding of the business\n\nSignify N.V. is a global provider of lighting solutions. The group is structured in components and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly. We paid specific attention in our audit to a number of areas driven by the operations of the group and our risk assessment. We start by determining materiality and identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and the sustainability information, whether due to error or fraud, in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Materiality\n\n## General\n\nThe scope of our audit procedures is influenced by the application of materiality. Our audit engagements aim to provide\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are considered to be material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the (economic) decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements and the sustainability information. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our assurance procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our conclusions.\n\n## Financial statements\n\n| Materiality        | EUR 32 million  (2021: EUR 32 million)                                                         |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Benchmark  applied | Approximately 4% of adjusted  earnings before interest, tax  and amortization (Adjusted        |\n|                    | EBITA) Explanation Based on our professional  judgment we consider  earnings-based measures as |\n|                    | the most appropriate basis to                                                                  |\n|                    | determine materiality.

When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and the company.\n\nWe have agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements which are identified during the audit and which in our view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative grounds, would be reported to them.\n\n## Scope of the group audit of the financial statements\n\nSignify N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. On this basis, we selected group entities for which an audit\n\nor review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or specific items.\n\nFollowing our assessment of the risk of material misstatement to Signify N.V.'s consolidated financial statements, we have selected two components that required an audit of the complete financial information (Full Scope Components). We have selected 27 components requiring audit procedures on specific account balances that we considered to have the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile (Specific Scope Components). We used the work of other EY member firms when auditing entities outside the Netherlands. We centrally performed audit procedures on accounting areas that are managed centrally such as goodwill, acquisitions, legal claims and treasury.\n\nAs a result of our scoping, our actual coverage varies per account balance. In addition, the level of detail of our audit procedures per account balance varies depending on our risk assessment.\n\nOf the remaining components, we performed risk-based analytical procedures to respond to any potential risks of material misstatements to the financial statements.\n\nAccordingly, our coverage of the group's Revenues and Total Assets can be summarized as follows:\n\n## Revenues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at components of the group, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion about the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Teaming and use of specialists\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group and at component levels included the appropriate skills and competences that are needed for the audit of a listed client in Signify's industry. We included specialists in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury and income tax and have made use of our own experts in the areas of valuations and actuaries.\n\n## Our focus on climate related risks and the energy transition\n\nClimate change and the energy transition are high on the public agenda. Issues such as CO2 reduction impact financial reporting, as these issues entail risks for the business operation, the valuation of assets ('stranded assets') and provisions or the sustainability of the business model and access to financial markets of companies with a larger CO2 footprint. The Sustainability statements summarize, amongst other topics, Signify's commitments and obligations and how the company is addressing climate-related and environmental risks.\n\nAs part of our audit of the financial statements, we evaluated the extent to which climate-related risks and the possible effects of the energy transition are taken into account in estimates and significant assumptions as well as in the design of relevant internal control measures by Signify N.V.. Furthermore, we read the Board of Management report and considered whether there is any material inconsistency between the non-financial information in chapter 16,\n\nSustainability statements, and the financial statements.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and noncompliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that both the financial statements and the sustainability information taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud might involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nWe identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements and the sustainability information due to fraud. During our audits we obtained an understanding of the entity and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the Supervisory Board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes.\n\nWe refer to chapter 12, Risk factors and risk management, for management's (fraud) risk\n\nassessment and chapter 8, Supervisory Board report, section 8.2, Key discussion topics and meetings in 2022, in which the Supervisory Board reflects on this (fraud) risk assessment.\n\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle-blower procedures and incident registration. We evaluated the design and the implementation and, where considered appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close cooperation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. As Signify N.V. is a global company operating in multiple jurisdictions, we considered the risk of bribery and corruption.\n\nWe incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audits. We also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls. For these risks we have performed procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that might represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgment areas and\n\nsignificant accounting estimates as disclosed in note 1, Basis of preparation, of chapter 14, Consolidated financial statements. We have also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions, including those with related parties. These risks did however not require significant auditor's attention.\n\nThe following fraud risk identified did require significant attention during our audit:\n\n## Presumed risk of fraud in revenue recognition\n\n| Fraud     | We presumed that there are       |\n|-----------|----------------------------------|\n| risk      | risks of fraud in revenue        |\n|           | recognition.

We also considered        |\n|           | whether the judgments and        |\n|           | assumptions in the               |\n|           | determination of these revenues  |\n|           | indicate a management bias that  |\n|           | material misstatement due to     |\n| Our audit | We describe the audit            |\n| approach  | procedures responsive to the     |\n|           | presumed risk of fraud in        |\n|           | revenue recognition in the       |\n|           | description of our audit         |\n|           | approach for the key audit       |\n|           | matter 'Improper revenue         |\n|           | recognition'.                    |\n\nWe considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives, directors (including internal audit, legal,\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of noncompliance with laws and regulations, including bribery and corruption that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general industry experience, through discussions with the management board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports, and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances or disclosures.\n\nWe also inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us.\n\n## Our audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in section 'Basis of preparation' in note 1, Basis of preparation, to the financial statements, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial statements, management made a specific assessment of the company's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated the specific assessment with management exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional skepticism.\n\nWe considered whether management's going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all relevant events or conditions that might cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties about going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions might cause a company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements and our audit of the sustainability\n\ninformation. We have communicated the key audit matters to the Supervisory Board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed.\n\nThe following key audit matters are modified, excluded or new compared to the key audit matters included in our last year's auditor's report:\n\n## Key audit matters for the audit of the financial statements\n\n| Key audit matter 2021                                         | Change   | Reason for change                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Improper revenue recognition                                  |          | Changed We reassessed the risk and concluded the risk of  improper revenue recognition is only related to  the sale of goods and not related to material  projects as was included in prior year. |\n| Valuation of inventories and  related obsolescence  provision | New      | The current macroeconomic developments  impacted Signify's inventory levels and valuation  thereof.                                                                                               |\n\n## For the audit of the sustainability information\n\n| Key audit matter 2021                                                                                                                     | Change   | Reason for change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Brighter Lives, Better World  2025 program: commitments  and criteria                                                                     |          | Excluded This is the second year Signify's Brighter Lives,  Better World 2025 program is disclosed in the  Sustainability statements.

Based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have considered whether the other information contains material misstatements. By performing these\n\nprocedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and Section 2:135b subsection 7 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the report of the Board of Management in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for ensuring that the remuneration report is drawn up and published in accordance with sections 2:135b and 2:145, sub -section 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board renders account of the implementation of the remuneration policy in 2022 in the remuneration report, as prepared by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements and ESEF\n\n## Engagement\n\nWe were engaged by the Supervisory Board as auditor of Signify N.V. (formerly: Philips Lighting N.V.) on July 15, 2016, as of the audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory auditor ever since that date.\n\n## No prohibited non-audit services\n\nWe have not provided prohibited non-audit services as referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities.\n\n## Other non-prohibited services provided\n\nOur services are only related to the audit of the financial statements or audit related services.\n\n## European Single Electronic Reporting Format (ESEF)\n\nSignify N.V. has prepared the Annual Report in ESEF. The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory technical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the Annual Report, prepared in the XHTML format, including the (partially) marked-up consolidated financial statements, as included in the reporting package by Signify N.V., complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing the Annual Report, including the financial statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby management combines the various components into a single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the Annual Report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake het voldoen aan de criteria voor het opstellen van een digitaal verantwoordingsdocument' (assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting). Our examination included among others:\n\n- \u00b7 obtaining an understanding of Signify N.V.'s financial reporting process, including the preparation of the reporting package\n- \u00b7 identifying and assessing the risks that the Annual Report does not comply in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF and designing and performing further assurance procedures responsive to those risks to provide a basis for our opinion, including:\n- - obtaining the reporting package and performing validations to determine whether the reporting package containing the Inline XBRL instance document and the XBRL extension taxonomy files, has been prepared in accordance with the technical specifications as included in the RTS on ESEF.\n- - examining the information related to the consolidated financial statements in the reporting package to determine whether all required mark-ups have been applied and whether these are in accordance with the RTS on ESEF.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Management is also responsible for selecting and applying the reporting criteria and for determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by management with respect to the scope of the sustainability information and the reporting policy are included in section 16.1, Approach to sustainability reporting.\n\nFurthermore, management is responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial statements and the sustainability information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing Signify N.V.'s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that might cast significant doubt on Signify N.V.'s ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for overseeing Signify N.V.'s reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagements in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinions.\n\nOur audits of the financial statements and the sustainability information have been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we might not detect all material errors and fraud during our audits.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nAn informative summary of the work performed as the basis of our conclusions is included in the Annex to the combined independent auditor's report.\n\nAmsterdam, the Netherlands February 28, 2023\n\nErnst & Young Accountants LLP\n\nA.E.

        "page_content": "## 18 Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures\n\n## Explanation of non-IFRS financial measures\n\nCertain parts of this Annual Report contain financial measures that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. These are commonly referred to as non-IFRS financial measures and include items such as comparable sales growth, adjusted gross margin, adjusted indirect costs, EBITA, adjusted EBITA, free cash flow and other related ratios.\n\nAlthough the non-IFRS financial measures presented are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS, the company uses these measures to monitor the underlying performance of its business and operations. These measures have not been audited or reviewed by the company's external auditor. Furthermore, these measures might not be indicative of the company's historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of the company's future results. These measures are presented in this Annual Report because the company considers them an important supplemental measure of its performance and believes that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which it operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity.\n\n## Comparable sales growth\n\nThe company discloses comparable sales growth as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure, as the company believes that the presentation of comparable sales growth is a meaningful measure for investors to evaluate the performance of the company's business activities over time. The company determines comparable sales growth by deducting the percentage figures for changes from the nominal change of sales. Interaction effects between currency movements, changes in consolidation, regulatory changes and changes in accounting standards (second order effects) are not taken into account. The company presents comparable sales growth on both a Division and Market Group basis. Comparable sales growth is also used by the company as a key financial measure to assess the operating performance of the Divisions and Market Groups.\n\n## Sales growth composition per business in %\n\n|                       | Comparable  growth   |   Currency  effects |   Consolidation  and other  changes | Nominal  growth   |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Digital Solutions     | 7.8                  |                 7.3 |                                 5   | 20.1              |\n| Digital Products      | (3.8)                |                 4.4 |                                 0   | 0.7               |\n| Conventional Products | (12.6)               |                 4.6 |                                 0   | (7.9)             |\n| Signify               | 1.2                  |                 6   |                                 2.4 | 9.5               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The company understands that these measures are used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the company's performance. The company presents EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio on a Division basis. The company also believes that the presentation of EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio provide useful information to investors on the development of the company's business and enhance the ability of investors to compare profitability across the Divisions. In the case of EBITA, the company believes that it makes the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out the amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill, which arises when acquisitions are consolidated by the company. In the case of Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio, the company believes that these measures make the underlying performance of its businesses more transparent by factoring out restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental charges which are not directly related to the operational performance of a Division. EBITA, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted EBITA ratio are also used by the company as key financial measures to assess the operating performance of the Divisions.\n\n## Adjusted EBITA to Income from operations (EBIT) in millions of EUR\n\n| 2022                             | Signify   | Digital  Solutions   | Digital  Products   | Conventional  Products   | Signify  Other   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 762       | 424                  | 297                 | 116                      | (75)             |\n| Restructuring                    | (64)      | (15)                 | (11)                | (34)                     | (4)              |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (27)      | (27)                 | -                   | -                        | -                |\n| Incidental items                 | 173       | (8)                  | (14)                | (22)                     | 217              |\n| EBITA                            | 844       | 374                  | 272                 | 60                       | 138              |\n| Amortization  1                  | (126)     | (118)                | (7)                 | -                        | (1)              |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 718       | 256                  | 265                 | 60                       | 137              |\n\n## 2021\n\n| Adjusted EBITA                   | 795   | 397   | 339   | 161   | (102)   |\n|----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|---------|\n| Restructuring                    | (86)  | (19)  | (4)   | (5)   | (58)    |\n| Acquisition-related charges      | (50)  | (49)  | (1)   | -     | -       |\n| Incidental items                 | (22)  | (11)  | (10)  | 2     | (4)     |\n| EBITA                            | 636   | 318   | 323   | 158   | (164)   |\n| Amortization  1                  | (122) | (114) | (7)   | -     | (1)     |\n| Income from operations (EBIT)  2 | 514   | 205   | 316   | 158   | (165)   |\n\n- 1 Amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets and goodwill.\n\n## Adjusted gross margin and Adjusted indirect costs: adjusted SG&A costs and adjusted R&D costs\n\nThe company discloses adjusted gross margin, adjusted SG&A costs and adjusted R&D costs as a supplemental non-IFRS financial measure.

The measures factor out restructuring costs, acquisition-related charges and other incidental charges attributable to cost of sales, SG&A and R&D costs which are not directly related to the operational performance of the company. Adjusted gross margin, adjusted SG&A and Adjusted R&D are also used by the company as key financial measures to assess the operating performance of the company.",

The company understands that free cash flow is broadly used by analysts, rating agencies and investors in assessing the company's performance. The company also believes that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the cash generated by the company's operating activities after deducting cash outflows for additions of intangible assets, capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment and proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Therefore, the measure gives an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of the company's business. In addition, because free cash flow is not impacted by purchases of businesses, it is less volatile than the total of cash flows from operating and investing activities. Free cash flow is also used by the company as a key financial measure to assess the operating performance of the company.\n\n## Composition of cash flows in millions of EUR\n\n|                                                            | 2021   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash flows from operating activities                       | 704    | 376    |\n| Cash flows from investing activities                       | (91)   | (256)  |\n| Cash flows before financing activities                     | 613    | 119    |\n| Cash flows from operating activities                       | 704    | 376    |\n| Net capital expenditures:                                  |        |        |\n| \u00b7  Additions of intangible assets                          | (34)   | (62)   |\n| \u00b7  Capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment   | (84)   | (70)   |\n| \u00b7  Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment | 27     | 201    |\n| Free cash flows                                            | 614    | 445    |\n\n## Free cash flows in millions of EUR\n\n|                          | 2021   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Digital Solutions  1     | 364    | 321    |\n| Digital Products  1      | 383    | 170    |\n| Conventional Products  1 | 136    | 56     |\n| Other                    | (270)  | (101)  |\n| Signify total            | 614    | 445    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

This means we aim to achieve the emission reduction goals laid out in the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C scenario for 2031 by 2025, six years early. With this scenario, the Paris Agreement suggests that companies must reduce their emissions by\n\n4.2% year on year. In other words, by the end of 2025, we will reduce our scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 40% compared to our baseline year 2019. To track progress, we are comparing Signify actual and projected carbon footprint every year from 2021 to 2025. Based on the 80% coverage of all Signify data from sold portfolio, we have estimated our 2022 value chain CO 2 . By extrapolating the remaining 20% within each product family, we calculated our 100% value chain CO 2 and concluded that we are 4% ahead on our projected carbon footprint for 2022. Comparing to the 2019 baseline, we have already achieved 30% emissions reduction across our value chain (vs. 40% by the end of 2025). With an estimated a 5% error rate for 2022 (10% in 2021), we have achieved between 27% and 34% emissions reduction across the value chain (vs. 40% by the end of 2025), which means that we are on track towards our 2025 targets.\n\n## Other taxes\n\nOther taxes comprise environmental taxes, property taxes and other contributions to governments in the form of taxes.

Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis and these measures and ratios might not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names. A reconciliation of these nonIFRS financial measures to the most directly comparable IFRS financial measures is contained in this document. For further information on non-IFRS financial measures, see chapter 18, Reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures.\n\n## Fair value information\n\nIn presenting Signify's financial position, fair values are used for the measurement of various items in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. These fair values are based on market prices, where available, and are obtained from sources that are deemed to be reliable. Readers are cautioned that these values are subject to changes over time and are only valid on the balance sheet date. When quoted prices or observable market values do not exist, fair values are estimated using valuation models, that we believe are appropriate for their purpose. They require management to make significant assumptions with respect to future developments that are inherently uncertain and might therefore deviate from actual developments.\n\nCritical assumptions used are disclosed in the financial statements. In certain cases, independent valuations are obtained to support management's determination of fair values.\n\n## IFRS basis of presentation\n\nThe financial information included in this document is based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU), as explained in significant accounting policies, unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Statutory financial statements\n\nChapter 14, Consolidated financial statements and chapter 15, Signify N.V. financial statements, contain the statutory financial statements of Signify N.V.\n\n## Regulated information\n\nThis document contains regulated information within the meaning of the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
