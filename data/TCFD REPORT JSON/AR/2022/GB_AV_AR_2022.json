This year our teams have been helping customers recover from the upheaval of storms, fire and flood. And we're looking at new ways to help with new problems too.\n\n## A familiar story\n\nIn February 2022, three violent storms struck\n\nthe UK and Ireland in quick succession. Thousands of households once again had to face up to widespread flooding, damage and disruption. Our teams were on hand for them in their hour of need, dealing with over 19,000 claims in the UK alone. Thanks to the flexibility of our model, colleagues from Canada were able to join in the effort and 10% of those claims were settled on the first day, helping people get back to normal as soon as they could.\n\n## 19,000\n\nUK customer claims for February storm damage\n\n## A new approach\n\nThis year also saw the start of a new partnership with US insurer Lemonade. They are widely recognised as a leading disrupter in the industry, using sophisticated data and technology to create simple, quick customer experiences with quotes in seconds and claims paid instantly.\n\nThe partnership will begin by focusing on developing new products for renters, a growing market that is typically underinsured, helping more people protect their homes and belongings.\n\nRead more in Our business review\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have been working with Fabric, a startup from our Founders Factory partnership, to help solve the problem.

Hard on the heels of the pandemic, we're witnessing war in Europe and a global energy crisis. Domestic politics has been volatile, to say the least. Inflation, rising interest rates, and a cost of living crisis unseen in generations are creating anxiety for millions of people.\n\n## A year of delivery\n\nTimes like these are testing for businesses, as they are for our people, and for our customers. This year's performance demonstrates that Aviva is more than rising to the challenge.\n\nWe have delivered another twelve months of strong performance. We're delivering against our strategy, focused now in markets where we have leading positions and clear competitive advantage.\n\nAnd our financial stability, and diverse products and channels mean our customers, communities and shareholders can have confidence that we're well positioned to be there for them come what may.\n\nOur strong financial performance in 2022, and our confidence in Aviva's prospects, meant we have declared a full year dividend of 31.0p. On top of this, we are also delivering on our commitment to return further capital through a \u00a3300 million buyback programme, providing even more value to our shareholders.\n\n31p 2022 total dividend per share\n\n## Fundamental strengths\n\nIn many ways, the events of the year brought into sharp relief the fundamental strengths of our business.\n\nAviva has always had the right pieces and they are now much better aligned to delivering good outcomes for all our stakeholders. This comes from having the right leadership team, led by Amanda Blanc and bolstered further by the recent arrival of Charlotte Jones as Group Chief Financial Officer, the right vision and the right strategy to achieve it.\n\nFor our customers, this means we can serve a very broad range of their lifetime needs, helping more people with their financial challenges. This is supported by our scale, which brings efficiencies on both costs and investment, and allows us to share expertise across the organisation. And our diversification provides resilience to shifting economic conditions as well as giving us capital and earnings benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We're on hand to help with people's financial conundrums, offering solutions to help make sense of the increasingly complicated choices about their insurance, wealth and retirement needs. We've also acted this year to help ease the impact of the cost of living crisis.\n\nTo serve them fully requires a new focus on ensuring our customers are at the forefront of our minds in all aspects of the business. This in turn demands a shift in our culture to become outstandingly customer-centric, a shift that is well underway.\n\nThis does not mean we will always get things right but there is a determination to learn and improve where we fall down. We are also intent on building from and improving on what we already have, innovating to offer a more seamless service, and better options to keep pace with our customers' evolving needs. This way we can continue to live up to our purpose of being 'with you today, for a better tomorrow'.\n\n## Community\n\nThat purpose also still underpins our ambition to be a sustainable business, fulfilling our responsibilities to be a good corporate citizen in all aspects of what we do.\n\n## 2040\n\n## Our ambition to be Net Zero\n\nYou can read more fully in this report about our plans to reach our ambition to be Net Zero by 2040. This ranges from plans to generate more of our own renewable energy, through offering better choices for our customers, to leading the debate about the need for organisations in both the private and public sector to have specific, credible plans to achieve the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nSustainability is about more than helping the UK become ready for a changing climate, of course. It also involves tackling the loss of biodiversity, and helping build stronger, more resilient communities.\n\nWe've also taken steps this year to offer more support to people in the challenging economic environment, and we remain committed to reinvesting 2% of Group adjusted operating profit into communities in the UK, Ireland and Canada.\n\n2%\n\nof Group adjusted operating profit reinvested into communities\n\nThe Aviva Community Fund and the Aviva Foundation also continue to support organisations making a difference to people's lives up and down the country.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nNone of this year's undoubted progress would be possible without the ongoing hard work, expertise and professionalism of our people. They continue to epitomise our values of care, commitment, community and confidence and I'd like to thank all my colleagues for the tremendous job they have done.\n\nI'm further encouraged by the increasing pride our people have in being part of Aviva, and the high levels of engagement and support we are seeing for our collective goal. Our shared success depends on everyone being able to give their all to the task.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nIt is likely that times will remain difficult for many people in the months to come. But difficult times serve to highlight the importance of what Aviva does and why we exist.\n\nI'm confident that Amanda, her team, and our people have got what it takes to take the business further forward. They have shown it this year. I trust they will show it again in the year ahead, doing the right things for our customers and for you, our shareholders.\n\n## George Culmer\n\nChair 8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Operating profit and dividends are growing and we have strong trading momentum despite significant market volatility.\n\nAmanda Blanc\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n'Our plan is working and our combination of Insurance, Wealth and Retirement brings clear benefits, as evidenced in our 2022 results. Although we have delivered a lot, there is so much more to go after to satisfy our big ambitions. This year's performance shows that we can, and we will, deliver on Aviva's promise.'\n\nAviva had an excellent 2022. We are making clear strategic progress and have delivered consistently strong results throughout the year.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur combination of insurance, wealth and retirement brings clear benefits. Our capital position remains very solid and has proven its resilience in the face of market volatility. Importantly, we have also invested significantly in Aviva's future: improving customer experience, targeting growth and further reducing our costs.\n\nThe fact that we've achieved this despite a difficult economic and political backdrop, shows once more that our strategy is the right one and the diversified business model we have built is working.\n\nI would like to thank all of my Aviva colleagues for their contribution to the 2022 results. In the face of a very challenging year, the team really delivered. Every single customer that chooses Aviva, every single life or business that we protect, every single claim that we handle well, is down to our people and their ability to deliver for our customers.\n\nSo, a very big thank you to the Aviva team.\n\n## Significant momentum in 2022\n\nThis year's results underline Aviva's ability to grow. We have demonstrated consistent and reliable momentum through disciplined, profitable growth and tight cost control. Value of new business (VNB) is up 14%, gross written premiums are up 11%, and we have had over \u00a39 billion of net flows into our Wealth business.\n\nIn Insurance, our Canadian business performed very well and is now number two by size in an attractive market. Commercial lines premiums were up 14% 1 across midmarket and Global Corporate Specialty (GCS) and Canadian personal lines delivered excellent growth in our key Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) partnership.\n\nIn the UK we delivered growth of 13% in our General Insurance Commercial Small and Medium Enterprise business. Group protection grew 29%, and health premiums were up 14% driven by strong SME sales.\n\nIn Wealth, workplace net flows of \u00a35.8 billion were up 14%, driven by strong retention and the inflationary impact on salaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur advisor platform business remained resilient with \u00a33.8 billion of net flows, despite severe cost of living pressures.\n\nAviva Investors delivered positive net flows of \u00a31.3 billion with our external clients in an extremely volatile year and was ranked third in ShareAction's report on the responsible investment practices of 77 of the world's largest asset managers.\n\nIn our Retirement business we transacted on 50 bulk purchase annuities (BPA) deals in 2022 for \u00a34.4 billion of present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) at very strong margins. The BPA pipeline is positive and we announced an \u00a3850 million buy-in transaction with the Arcadia schemes in February 2023.\n\nExternal individual annuities PVNBP were around 70% higher, as rising interest rates drive more attractive pricing for consumers, and equity release PVNBP were up 17%.\n\nSolvency II own funds generation increased by 37%; group adjusted operating profit was 35% higher and we delivered a strong Group combined operating ratio (COR) of 94.6% despite the impact of inflation and adverse weather in the UK.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's report continued\n\nThe strength of our COR once more points to the benefits of the scale and diversification of our general insurance businesses in the UK, Ireland and Canada.\n\nCash remittances from continuing operations are up 11% to \u00a31.8 billion in 2022 while costs were 3% lower. We have maintained our focus on cost discipline and efficiency, which is a strong performance given the significant inflationary backdrop.\n\nThese results are testament to the progress that we have made over the past two years in simplifying the business, building resilience, and further embedding a high performance culture across Aviva.\n\nAnd that performance underpins our confidence in the delivery of our targets.\n\nWe completed the return of \u00a34.75 billion of capital to shareholders during 2022 and we have declared a final dividend of 20.7p, bringing the total dividend for the year to 31.0p, in line with our guidance.\n\nWe know how important a sustainable dividend is for our shareholders and our guidance of c.\u00a3915 million cash cost for 2023 remains unchanged. We have also announced an upgrade to our dividend guidance. We have strong confidence in our future performance, and in the outlook for sustainable growth in cash generation, and so we now expect to grow the cash cost of our dividend by low-to-mid single digits from 2024 onwards.\n\nUnder our capital framework, surplus capital is available for reinvestment in the business, focused M&A and returns to shareholders. The momentum and consistency in our performance, together with our capital strength allow us to deliver on our commitment of further capital returns, starting immediately with a \u00a3300 million share buyback programme. Our preference remains for regular and sustainable returns of surplus capital over time, in addition to the ordinary dividend.\n\n## Delivering the strategy is unlocking competitive advantage\n\nOur plan and strategy to transform Aviva remains unchanged.\n\nWe are utterly focused on executing against each of our four strategic priorities customer, growth, efficiency, and sustainability - and this is unlocking the clear competitive advantages that come from Aviva's model: our customer base, our scale, and our diversification.\n\nIn turn this is driving a higher quality and more consistent financial performance for our shareholders.\n\n## Meeting more of our customers' needs\n\nThe strategy starts with our 18.7 million customers. Almost 14% of the UK population are saving or retiring with Aviva. They are central to everything we do, and over the past year we have continued to deliver for them.\n\nIn 2022 we paid \u00a323.2 billion in claims, fulfilling our purpose to be with people in the crunch times when it really matters.\n\nWe want more customers to stay with us for longer, so we can look after more of their needs, brilliantly. And we are making good progress.\n\nThis year we have won over 370 new Workplace schemes and customer numbers in the UK have grown to 15.5 million.\n\nWe are investing to accelerate this advantage. To make it easier for our customers to buy from us, we are building an engaging mobile-led customer experience which will deliver more personalised interactions. And we can see that this investment is working. For example, improvements we made to the MyAviva pension digital journey have resulted in over \u00a3600 million of additional flows in 2022.\n\nWe are also investing in innovation to improve the products and services we can offer and are making it easier for customers to do business with us.\n\nFor example, we are launching a new market-leading pension tracing and consolidation proposition which will be available for all Workplace and Direct customers.\n\n## Delivering on our ambitious growth plans\n\nOur excellent performance is a result of our simpler, more focused business. We recognise the difficult economic environment we are operating in, with the cost of living crisis, high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. But even in these challenging times, we are driving profitable growth right across Insurance, Wealth and Retirement.\n\nEach plays a critical role in our portfolio and we are not relying on any single business for our growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will also build on our leading position in UK High Net Worth (HNW) following our acquisition of Azur's UK HNW personal lines business.\n\nIn Wealth, we are aiming for at least 10% growth in net flows. We have enhanced our master trust proposition and launched open banking functionality, furthering our market leadership in Workplace.\n\nWe are now focused on building our direct wealth offering and an integrated wealth proposition.\n\nWe also completed the acquisition of Succession Wealth in August and we moved quickly to enhance our proposition for customers and advisors with better service, a lower-cost Aviva platform, and award-winning investment solutions from Aviva Investors.\n\nFinally, in Retirement we are continuing to invest in our BPA platform which went live to new customers in 2022, and we are expanding our adviser capabilities to support growth in Equity Release.\n\n## Delivering real efficiency gains\n\nRunning ourselves efficiently remains a nonnegotiable and despite high inflation across our markets, we have delivered our 2022 target with a net cost 1 reduction of \u00a3327 million. This equates to \u00a3575 million gross of inflation. We are on track to deliver our \u00a3750 million gross cost reduction target by the end of 2024.\n\nWe have achieved this with simplified customer journeys, reduced property costs, outsourcing in Aviva Investors, streamlined IT and a reduced number of products.\n\nWe have also significantly reduced costs at the Group centre.\n\nAll of this points to a new and permanent culture of operational efficiency that we are embedding across the group, to deliver our commitment of top quartile efficiency.\n\n## Leading in sustainability\n\nOn sustainability we continue to lead the pack on climate action, working towards our ambition to become Net Zero by 2040.\n\nWe are ranked fifth amongst global insurers by Sustainalytics and our S&P Global rating improved - putting us in the 95th percentile.\n\nWe have donated \u00a338 million to restore Britain's lost temperate rainforests as part of a broader \u00a3100 million programme to help address climate change through supporting biodiversity.\n\nOn social action, we are stepping up our ambition to help regenerate communities, investing \u00a325 billion in the UK economy over the next 10 years. And we are reinvesting 2% of our group adjusted operating profit in communities every year.\n\n## Delivering Aviva's Promise\n\nAll the elements are clicking into place for Aviva to provide even more value for customers and shareholders.\n\nWe have had an excellent year. We have delivered strong and resilient financial performance quarter by quarter.\n\nOur plan is working and our combination of Insurance, Wealth and Retirement brings clear benefits, as evidenced in our 2022 results.\n\nWe have leading positions in all chosen markets, high performing businesses, talented leaders, committed people and a formidable brand.\n\nWe have the right strategy to unlock the unique advantages of our model and we are executing it. We generate an attractive and growing dividend and we are aiming for regular and sustainable capital returns alongside this.\n\nAlthough we have a delivered a lot, there is so much more to go after to satisfy our big ambitions.\n\nThis year's performance shows that we can, and we will, deliver on Aviva's promise.\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Amanda Blanc 8 March 2023\n\n- 1.

Estimated dividends are for guidance and are subject to change.

These metrics include APMs, which are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measures that are not bound by the requirements of IFRS or Solvency II.  A complete list of the APMs used by the Group, and further guidance in respect of their use, can be found in the 'Other information' section in part 2 of the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nWe've delivered a further \u00a3200 million of cost reduction gross of inflation 3 , taking total cost reduction since 2018 to \u00a3575 million. We are on track to achieve our cost target of \u00a3750 million by 2024.\n\nAlongside this strong progress on efficiency, we have also grown the business. We now expect to exceed our own funds generation target of \u00a31.5 billion by 2024 and are firmly on track to meet our cash remittance target of >\u00a35.4 billion cumulative 2022-24.\n\nOur capital position has proved extremely robust, remaining very strong throughout the year in the face of significant market volatility. This has enabled us to deliver on our commitment to shareholders as we have announced a new share buyback of \u00a3300 million which will commence on 10 March 2023. We anticipate further returns of surplus capital in the future and our preference remains for returns to be regular and sustainable.\n\nOur confidence in the performance trajectory of Aviva, and in the outlook for sustainable growth in cash generation means we have also upgraded our dividend guidance.\n\nOur guidance for a c.\u00a3915 million dividend cash cost in 2023 4 remains unchanged, but we now expect to grow the cash cost of our dividend by low-to-mid single-digits from 2024 onwards.\n\nI am confident that Aviva is well placed to succeed. We have a strong brand and market leading positions in our core markets. We have a clear strategy and are focused on executing it as we have begun to unlock the competitive advantage of the diversified business model.\n\nIt is clear that we are starting to see the results of the steps we have taken to transform performance, but there is so much more we want to achieve. We are extremely confident in the future of Aviva and our commitment to deliver on our promise to our customers, our shareholders, our employees and our communities.\n\n## Read more\n\nMore details can be found in:\n\n> Key performance indicators\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chief Financial Officer's report continued\n\n## Group financial headlines\n\n## Operating results\n\n## Cash remittances\n\nCash remittances were up 11% to \u00a31,845 million (2021 1 : \u00a31,662 million). UK & Ireland Life remittances were lower in 2022 however this was more than offset by UK & Ireland General Insurance and Canada, demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business model. We are on track to deliver our cash remittance target of >\u00a35.4 billion over 2022-24.\n\n## IFRS performance\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit 2 increased by 35% to \u00a32,213 million (2021 1 : \u00a31,634 million). Excluding UK Life management actions and other of \u00a3278 million (2021: \u00a377 million), group adjusted operating profit 2 was up 24% to \u00a31,935 million (2021 1 : \u00a31,557 million).\n\nUK & Ireland Life adjusted operating profit 2 was up 34% with strong performance in Retirement (Annuities & Equity Release) driven by improved margins, earnings growth on the in-force book and other favourable experience.\n\nAdjusted operating profit 2 in Wealth was lower in 2022 while Protection & Health was flat. Heritage adjusted operating profit grew in the period, reflecting the impact of market movements on policyholder tax.\n\nGeneral Insurance adjusted operating profit 2 was up 1% to \u00a3771 million (2021 1 : \u00a3762 million) reflecting strong performance in Canada partly offset by lower profits in UK & Ireland.\n\nThe UK, Ireland and Canada all saw a return to more normal claims frequency, and benefited from improved LTIR returns from higher reinvestment yields. Importantly, the Group has managed the inflationary environment well, and continues to remain vigilant in this regard.\n\nWe manage the business on a Solvency II basis and our hedging strategy, which reduces volatility from economic and market fluctuations, is focused on protecting the Solvency II capital position and securing our ability to pay dividends. This approach introduces IFRS volatility from the movement in the fair-value of assets which are held for the long term to back liabilities and capital requirements. During 2022 our IFRS results were adversely impacted by rising interest rates which reduced the fair value of these assets. As we focus on the Solvency II capital position, we accept variability in the IFRS results. The IFRS loss for the year was \u00a3(1,139) million (2021: profit of \u00a32,036 million) while basic earnings per share decreased to (38.2) pence (2021: 50.1 pence). Higher operating profit was more than offset by these economic and market movements.\n\n## Cost reduction\n\nBaseline controllable costs 3 from continuing operations, fell by 3% to 2,771 million (2021: \u00a32,854 million) despite headwinds from inflation. Since 2018 we have achieved \u00a3327 million of savings net of inflation, ahead of target. We are on track to meet our ambition of \u00a3750 million (gross of inflation) cost reduction from the 2018 baseline by the end of 2024.\n\n## \u00a3327m\n\nControllable costs savings vs. 2018 3\n\n## Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG)\n\nSolvency II OFG, a key measure of growth, increased by 37% to \u00a31,623 million (2021 1 : \u00a31,187 million) driven primarily by strong growth in UK Life, which benefited from growth in Retirement, Wealth, and management actions and other.\n\nSolvency II OFG in UK & Ireland General Insurance and Canada was marginally lower in 2022, a good performance given the inflationary backdrop and the return to more normal levels of claims frequency in 2022. Solvency II OFG also benefited from lower central costs and external debt costs as a result of our simplification and deleveraging programme.\n\nSolvency II OFG excluding management actions and other was up 15% in 2022.\n\nWe are \u00a31.5 billion per annum by 2024, a target which assumes a lower contribution from management actions & other than seen in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

UK & Ireland combined operating ratio (COR) was 96.1% (2021: 94.3%), a strong result given the challenging conditions in 2022.\n\nSolvency II OFG was 14% lower at \u00a3293 million (2021: \u00a3339 million), with the lower result primarily reflecting a return to more normal claims frequency.\n\nCash remittances increased 180% to \u00a3731 million (2021: \u00a3261 million), reflecting both the cash generated from the operations as well as surplus capital in excess of local risk appetite.\n\nGross written premiums (GWP)increased 7% to \u00a35,740 million (2021: \u00a35,352 million). UK commercial lines was up 12% driven by strong retention, new business growth and increased rates.\n\nUK personal lines was up 2% as we focused on pricing discipline amid adverse conditions, while we benefited from our strengths in price comparison websites and from the launch of Aviva Zero.\n\nBaseline controllable costs 3 reduced 1% to \u00a3703 million (2021: \u00a3713 million) despite the inflationary environment, and while continuing to grow the business.\n\n## Canada\n\nCanada adjusted operating profit 2 increased 6% to \u00a3433 million (2021: \u00a3406 million) and was flat in constant currency. A lower underwriting result, driven by increased claims frequency and the impact of inflation was offset by improved investment returns. The combined operating ratio was 92.5% (2021: 90.7%).\n\nThis is a strong performance in 2022 given challenging conditions and reflects our focus on prudent underwriting and rate actions.\n\nSolvency II OFG was 2% lower at \u00a3325 million (2021: \u00a3332 million) reflecting inflationary impacts and increased claims frequency. Cash remittances grew strongly to \u00a3287 million (2021: \u00a3156 million), with higher remittances partly reflecting the payment of surplus capital in excess of local risk appetite.\n\nGWP of \u00a34,009 million (2021: \u00a33,455 million) was up 9% on a constant currency basis. Personal lines was up 6% in constant currency reflecting higher rate in Ontario motor and growth in our direct business. Commercial lines was up 14% 4 reflecting the favourable rate environment as well as strong growth in mid-market and large corporate accounts.\n\nBaseline controllable costs 3 increased 3% on a constant currency basis to \u00a3410 million (2021: \u00a3399 million) as we invest in our core capabilities and our digital direct business.\n\n- 1.

Revenues were 6% lower at \u00a3379 million (2021: \u00a3403 million) reflecting the impact of weak investment markets on average AUM, with the most significant impact on credit.\n\nSolvency II OFG was \u00a324 million (2021: \u00a336 million) while cash remittances increased to \u00a328 million (2021: \u00a315 million).\n\nNet outflows improved to \u00a3(3.8) billion (2021: \u00a3(4.6) billion), of which \u00a3(3.9) billion related to strategic actions, mainly from the sale of France. External net flows were resilient in light of difficult market conditions at \u00a31.3 billion (2021: \u00a33.3 billion).\n\nBaseline controllable costs 2 were 4% lower at \u00a3331 million (2021: \u00a3345 million).\n\n## International investments\n\nAdjusted operating profit 1 was \u00a352 million (2021: \u00a397 million) and SII OFG was \u00a3106 million (2021: \u00a3124 million), with the lower operating performance primarily due to a one-off property charge.\n\nPVNBP was 3% lower in constant currency at \u00a31,172 million (2021: \u00a31,122 million) and up 5% at reported FX.\n\nCash remittances increased to \u00a319 million (2021: \u00a311 million) benefiting from an increased dividend pay-out ratio agreed with our partner in China.\n\n## Capital and cash\n\n## Solvency II capital\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Aviva's Solvency II shareholder surplus was \u00a38.7 billion and estimated Solvency II shareholder cover ratio was 212% (2021: 13.1 billion and 244% respectively). Our pro forma Solvency II shareholder cover ratio allowing for the remaining debt reduction and \u00a3(0.1)billion pension scheme payment, is estimated at 207%.\n\nAfter allowing for the payment of the final dividend and \u00a3300 million share buyback, the ratio is estimated to be 196%.\n\nThe solvency capital requirement of \u00a37.8 billion includes a \u00a32.1 billion benefit from Group diversification.\n\nSolvency II net asset value per share was 390 pence (2021: 417 pence).\n\n## Centre liquidity\n\nAt end February 2023, centre liquidity was \u00a32.2 billion (end February 2022: \u00a36.6 billion) with the reduction primarily driven by the \u00a33.75 billion capital return, \u00a30.5 billion subordinated debt redemption, ordinary dividends of \u00a30.8 billion and centre and debt costs of \u00a30.8 billion, partly offset by cash remittances of \u00a31.8 billion.\n\n## Solvency II debt leverage\n\nSolvency II debt leverage ratio increased to 31% (2021: 27%) primarily as a result of the reduction in own funds following the capital return.\n\nOur pro forma Solvency II debt leverage ratio is 30% after allowing for the planned \u00a30.5 billion debt reduction 3 and the \u00a30.1 billion pension payment.\n\n## Dividend\n\nOn 8 March 2023 we approved a final dividend per share for 2022 of 20.7 pence (2021: 14.7 pence). Together with an interim dividend of 10.30 pence (2021: 7.35 pence) this bring total dividends for the year to 31.00 pence (2021: 22.05 pence) with a cash cost of c.\u00a3870 million.\n\nOur guidance for 2023 is for a dividend payment of c.\u00a3915 million 4 .

This reinforces our confidence in the prospects, financial targets and outlook for the Group.\n\nIn UK & Ireland Life we expect higher BPA volumes in 2023 as a growing number of pension schemes look to de-risk. Our Wealth business remains positioned to grow, and while market conditions are challenging in the near-term in Adviser Platform, our Workplace business offers strong growth opportunities. We continue to expect good demand for Protection and Health products.\n\nIn General Insurance we will remain focused on pricing appropriately for the inflationary environment. In the UK, we expect to see continued momentum in commercial lines while we focus on growing our retail business in personal lines. In Canada, rates are expected to remain supportive in commercial lines along with personal property, while we continue to focus on managing rate in personal motor given the inflationary pressures, and growing our RBC partnership and direct business.\n\nAcross General Insurance, we remain focused on meeting our <94% 1 COR ambition over time.\n\nAviva Investors continues to focus on improving efficiency across the business, and is taking actions to drive improvements. However, conditions are likely to remain challenging in 2023 given ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment and investment markets.\n\nWe are committed to delivering for our shareholders.We have set out a sustainable dividend policy, and expect to pay a dividend of c.\u00a3915 million 2 for 2023, with low-to-mid single digit growth in the cash cost of the dividend thereafter.\n\nUnder our capital framework, surplus capital is available for reinvestment in the business, focused M&A and returns to shareholders.

This includes the expansion of our digital support, (e.g. helping customers through Live Chat) and the introduction of Apple Pay. We have also enabled self-help on Aviva Connect, allowing intermediaries to access documents and data online.\n\n## Innovating for our customers\n\nCustomers who hold multiple products are more engaged, more inclined to buy new products and more likely to stay with us for longer.\n\nWe are developing propositions that connect our products for our customers and have seen some early signs of success (e.g. offering pension customers real-time preferential pricing for motor products).\n\nWe are also investing in innovation to improve the products and services we can offer and are making it easier for customers to do business with us. For example, we are launching a new market-leading pension tracing and consolidation proposition, built in partnership with the Founders Factory. This will benefit our Workplace customers immediately and Direct customers from April this year. Our ambition here is to generate material growth over the next three years.\n\n## Focus for 2023\n\nWe will focus on strengthening our brand and connecting it to what we do, while also enhancing our marketing effectiveness and moving us towards our ambition to be the number 1 brand for trust and consideration across our Insurance, Wealth and Retirement markets.\n\nWe will continue to prioritise the optimisation of our digital customer journeys as we aim to engage more customers through MyAviva and support more customers to self-serve across their products.\n\nWe will also continue to look for innovative ways to leverage our product expertise to develop propositions for our individual and corporate customers.\n\n18.7m\n\nNumber of Customers (2021: 18.5m)\n\n40.5\n\nTransactional Net Promoter Score (2021: 42.5)\n\n4.4m\n\nMulti product holding (UK customers only) (2021: 4.4m)\n\nRead more on KPIs > page 1.31\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have also grown our UK Personal Lines business and shown resilience in a difficult economic climate. This has been supported by continued growth in Aviva Online, reaching 1 million policies. We launched Aviva Zero, a carbon-conscious proposition in Motor, selling over 50,000 policies and offsetting over 300 million miles of driving. To further accelerate our growth in the attractive high net worth (HNW) segment, we purchased Azur underwriting, bringing scale and strength to our HNW proposition.

In Workplace, we have delivered 374 new Workplace schemes and enhanced our Master Trust proposition. We have strengthened our advice business with the acquisition of Succession Wealth and recorded above market client and adviser retentions.\n\nWe have also added over \u00a32 billion in assets through acquisitions. Our Direct Wealth business has delivered a new pension consolidation and tracking service for our customers.\n\n## Retirement\n\nOur retirement business continues to play a key role supporting our medium-term cash generation. Our BPA business has delivered stable profits and we have made good progress on the modernisation of our BPA platform. We have improved pricing in Individual Annuities and expanded our advisor capability to include Equity Release advice for our customers.\n\n## Focus for 2023\n\nWe remain focused on delivering targeted, disciplined and profitable growth and achieving our external ambitions which include a combined operating ratio of less than 94% 1 , at least 10% compounded annual growth rate in Wealth net flows and an annual growth rate of 5-7% in the value of new business for UK & Ireland Life.\n\nTo support these ambitions, we have a number of focus areas, including targeting new distribution opportunities in our General Insurance business, accelerating GCS growth in Canada, connecting customers with our integrated wealth proposition and ensuring our Bulk Purchase Annuity business continues to play a key role in delivering future cash generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have recently reduced our occupied footprint across our Leatherhead, Edinburgh and Bristol properties.\n\n## Organisation simplification\n\nWe continue to focus on the simplification of our organisation. In Aviva Investors, we have optimised the outsourcing of our Real and Liquid asset operations with implementation expected to continue into 2023 and in Canada, we have centralised operations in Commercial Lines. We have also focused on embedding cost discipline across the organisation and implemented a new and more efficient operating model.\n\n## Focus for 2023\n\nWe will continue to drive scale efficiencies and deliver our \u00a3750 million gross savings target by the end of 2024.\n\nSimplification of our business will continue to be a key priority and we remain committed to delivering top quartile efficiency across all our businesses.\n\nWe will also commence the move to our new London headquarters. We expect this to complete delivery of a c.40% reduction in our Aviva UK property footprint while continuing to support our sustainability ambitions with a significant reduction to our carbon emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

To date we have achieved a 43% reduction in our operational carbon emissions against our 2019 baseline and are focused on making our operations and supply chain Net Zero by 2030.\n\nWe have also validated our carbonreduction goals with the Science Based Targets initiatives (SBTi), strengthened our Environmental, Social and corporate Governance (ESG) Baseline Underwriting and Investment Exclusion policies, established partnerships for our naturebased projects and received a Building Public Trust Award for our climate reporting for the second year in a row.\n\n## Stronger Communities\n\nTo support those impacted by the cost of living crisis, we pledged \u00a39 million to Citizens Advice and The Money Advice Trust.\n\nFor our colleagues we have provided 21,000 free kids lunches and made over 9,000 oneoff cost of living payments. For our customers we have provided affordable and robust product options and extended our premium deferrals. We also donated \u00a31.2 million to the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal and launched a number of naturebased projects as part of our partnership with World Wide Fund for Nature.\n\n## Sustainable Business\n\nWe have made tangible progress on diversity, equity and inclusion this year and increased the percentage of senior women leaders.\n\nOur overall progress has been recognised with strong external rankings. In February 2023, we were ranked 5th out of 293 Global Insurers by Sustainalytics.\n\n## Focus for 2023\n\nAlong with members of the Net Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), we will publish our baseline metrics and targets to identify and understand the attributed carbon emissions from the activities we underwrite.\n\nWe will continue to build stronger communities, invest in the UK economy and reinvest 2% of our annual Group adjusted operating profit into communities (three year average).\n\nWe will continue to ensure sustainability is embedded across our business and make progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion targets.\n\n## 39%\n\nReduction in the weighted average carbon intensity of our credit and equity investments (Shareholder and With-profits Portfolio only) 1 (2021: 24%)\n\n## \u00a36.9bn\n\nAmount invested in UK infrastructure and real estate from 2021-22 (2021: \u00a34.3bn)\n\n37.3%\n\nWomen in senior leadership roles (2021: 33.7%)\n\nRead more on KPIs > page 1.31\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have launched additional support for customers affected by the cost of living crisis. We have also honoured our COVID-19 pledge, returning \u00a381 million to eligible UK private health insurance customers for claims that were delayed throughout the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase in MyAviva registrations during 2022 compared to 2021\n\n- \u00b7 We strive to make our customer experience the best in the market, making it easy for customers, intermediaries and clients to do business with us in the way that works best for them. By the end of 2022, we digitised over 62% of our customer journeys, supporting pension consolidation, faster payments and online customer service to name but a few. Our MyAviva app was downloaded over 625,000 times for managing pensions alone, as customers are increasingly looking to self-serve on the go.\n\n- \u00b7 We have listened to our intermediaries too, delivering the functionality they need most. In total, 4.6 million digital transactions took place across our customers, advisers and brokers.\n- \u00b7 As well as enabling us to meet the changing needs of our customers, digitisation of our journeys and automation of our processes has also supported our efficiency ambitions, contributing to over \u00a340 million in operational cost savings during 2022.\n- \u00b7 We have pursued targeted growth opportunities. In March, we announced the acquisition of leading independent financial advice firm Succession Wealth accelerating our ability to offer highquality financial advice to a significant number of our customers without an existing adviser. Integration was completed in August, six months ahead of schedule. Since then, Succession Wealth has continued to expand its presence across the UK and the firm's advisers can now select Aviva from their panel of providers.\n- \u00b7 Meanwhile, we have written new business with improved margins across product lines, for instance winning \u00a34.4 billion bulk purchase annuity (BPA) deals in 2022 whilst maintaining pricing discipline.\n- \u00b7 Our position in the Group is critical to the delivery of Aviva's Sustainability Ambition. By June 2022, we had exceeded our 2022 goal of \u00a310 billion of auto-enrolment assets placed into low carbon equities and climate transition strategies.\n\n## Products and customers\n\n## Insurance\n\nWe are the UK's only provider of scale, offering protection and health for both individuals and corporate clients. We have sustained strong market positions and received recognition at the 2022 Cover Excellence Awards for the impact we have made on the industry over the past 25 years.\n\nThrough individual protection, we support customers and their families in the event of loss of income, critical illness or bereavement. In 2021, we paid out \u00a31.1 billion of individual protection claims.\n\nGroup protection helps employers keep their workforce healthy and supports them in adverse circumstances. Our Group Protection portfolio 1 grew from \u00a3494 million to \u00a3552 million in 2022, driven by strong retention and large client wins. The strength of our support and add-on services makes us first choice for key brokers and employer benefits consultants.\n\nOur digitally led wellness proposition, DigiCare+, provides both individual and group protection customers with a holistic wellbeing solution, including health checks, access to digital GPs (General Practitioners), second medical opinions, mental health support and bereavement support.\n\n## \u00a381m\n\n## Returned to eligible UK private health insurance customers as part of our COVID-19 pledge\n\nOur health proposition gives 1.1 million people seamless access to private medical services and treatment. In 2022, we have continued to see increased demand for private health insurance. We have paid over \u00a3485 million in claims and supported our customers with access to digital GPs.\n\n## Wealth\n\nWe are the UK's largest bundled workplace provider 2 , with over 26,000 corporate clients and four million members, and won over 370 new schemes in 2022. Our success has been built on strong relationships with intermediaries and innovative workplace propositions. Our commitment to ESG and members' financial wellbeing has been recognised, winning 'Best Default ESG Strategy' at the 2022 Corporate Adviser Awards and five Gold awards from Benefits Guru.\n\nOur Intermediated & Retail business includes the UK's second largest adviser platform by net flows in the open market 3 , and we have written business with c.7,600 advisors to whom we provide a wide range of support.\n\n- 1.

We work hand in hand with Aviva Investors to support the UK economy, with over \u00a325 billion invested in UK infrastructure and commercial mortgages over the last ten years.\n\nBPA allows pension trustees to secure future obligations to defined benefit scheme members by de-risking their pension schemes.

We are the UK's largest provider 2 and provide an income to over one million customers.\n\nEquity release supplements retirement income in a tax efficient way by unlocking housing equity. We manage the UK's largest book of equity release mortgages 3 and lent over \u00a3800 million to customers in 2022. We believe the market will continue to grow reflecting an increasing need for customers to release equity from their homes.\n\n## Ireland Life\n\nIn Ireland we are number four 4 in the market. We offer a wide range of products across protection, savings, pensions and annuities and are committed to making it easier for intermediaries to do business with Aviva.\n\nIn 2022, we embarked on an ambitious three-year Digital Transformation & Automation program to redefine how we interact with our customers. Our overall transactional net promoter score (TNPS) improved by five points to +35 (2021: +30).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase in 2022 Ireland Life TNPS score compared to 2021\n\nWe delivered on a number of key initiatives, including the introduction of Master Trust to our Corporate and Retail pension product offerings to meet customer demand.\n\nWe were awarded eight Sustainability awards in 2022, including the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion award at the prestigious Business & Finance Irish Business Awards. Aviva Ireland also announced funding of \u20ac5 million to The Nature Trust to plant new native woodlands.\n\n## Key priorities for 2023\n\nWe have come out of 2022 in a strong position, with many foundations now in place across Aviva's strategic priorities.\n\nIn 2023, we are continuing to focus on delivering what matters most to our customers whilst driving profitable growth and long-term efficiencies. We remain committed to deliver on our ambitions across climate, community, and business sustainability.\n\nWe are leveraging the unique breadth of the Aviva Group to best meet the needs of our customers and clients in a compelling, cohesive way.\n\nWe are continuing to develop customerfocused propositions and innovation across our Insurance, Wealth and Retirement businesses.\n\nWe are focusing on connecting our customers to our growing advice capability, with solutions across the full spectrum of face-to-face, digital and hybrid engagement.\n\nWe are promoting diversified growth by strengthening our Workplace, Retail, Health and Protection propositions, whilst continuing to apply rigorous selection and a high level of discipline in our BPA growth strategy and accelerating the development of our Wealth offering available to our customers through the direct channel.\n\nOngoing digitisation of customer journeys, automation of operations and simplification of our IT infrastructure remain a priority to succeed. We are significantly investing in the digital experiences we bring to our customers, partners and clients.\n\nFinally, we will continue to deliver on our promises to be a climate champion by leading the UK's financial services industry in sustainability and ESG.\n\n- 1.

Despite this, we continue to grow market share by winning new business, while maintaining pricing and portfolio discipline and a continued focus on our cost base.\n\nOur strategy remains investing for profitable, diversified growth; and to deliver on our ambition to be the clear market leader for GI in the UK and Ireland. We are pursuing this by delivering across four priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Being a trusted customer champion;\n- \u00b7 Becoming a diversified growth engine;\n- \u00b7 Forging first class operational foundations to drive efficiency;\n- \u00b7 Leading on sustainability.\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Our business review: UK & Ireland General Insurance continued\n\n## Operational highlights\n\n- \u00b7 We started the year with the successful implementation of the FCA Pricing Practices regulation, and we support bringing greater clarity and consistency to consumers across GI pricing. We remain confident in both our execution against the new rules and our competitive position.\n- \u00b7 In Q1 we launched Quotemehappy (QMH) Essentials, providing quality cover but with fewer features, helping customers access insurance in the current cost of living crisis, and QMH Connect, a new app based connected motor proposition that encourages and rewards safer driving from younger customers.\n- \u00b7 We also launched Aviva Zero, our new sustainable motor proposition, selling around 51,000 policies in 2022 and carbon offsetting more than 300 million miles of driving.\n- \u00b7 To further accelerate our growth in the attractive high net worth (HNW) segment, we purchased Azur underwriting, bringing further scale and strength to the Aviva HNW proposition. We will now build on our leading position.\n- \u00b7 Our cladding proposition now supports over 7,000 leaseholders, over 1,400 of which were new customers who previously had no affordable access to insurance. We also continue to lobby for greater support from the wider market through the ABI.\n\n- \u00b7 We have grown our renewables insurance book by 30%, and are supporting new initiatives such as 'Connected Kerb' in its plans to deliver 190,000 on-street EV chargers by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Our Risk Management Solutions team provided prevention advice, virtually and on-site, with 50,000 client engagements in 2022.\n- \u00b7 We continue to expand our distribution footprint, launching partnerships that include offering flexible renters insurance with Lemonade, and with Zego to offer telematics based, flexible fleet insurance.\n- \u00b7 We provide vital specialist cover for the particular risks faced by some of the leading financial institutions, and have already built a \u00a325 million portfolio.\n- \u00b7 We continue to develop our product proposition suite with the launch of Aviva Minifleet, a flexible motor policy for businesses with up to 15 vehicles, writing more than \u00a33 million in the first year.\n- \u00b7 We have continued to build capabilities in our Commercial Lines business, with over 400 underwriting license increases, 140 promotions and 191 new hires.\n- \u00b7 The positive sentiment we receive from brokers was validated with the Insurance Times 5* Commercial Lines rating, and our Financial Lines proposition topped the Insurance Age broker survey. We were also winner of 'General insurer of the year' for the ninth year at the Insurance Times awards in December.\n- \u00b7 Performance in the Irish business has now been stabilised (following a couple of years of portfolio remediation), and returned to growth in 2022.\n- \u00b7 We are investing heavily in technology to support the Irish business, modernising technology in the front and back office.\n- \u00b7 Engagement across our people increased from 70% to 88% for UK & Ireland GI in our annual 'Voice of Aviva' survey.\n\n## Products and customers Personal lines\n\nIn personal lines we offer motor, home, travel and gadget insurance. Our multi-channel distribution includes selling direct to customers through MyAviva and price comparison websites, as well as reaching our customers through intermediary relationships with brokers, affinity partners, 'fintechs' and several of the UK's leading banks.\n\nOur strategy is to focus on growing our Retail business and attractive, profitable segments within our market leading business-to-business (B2B) distribution.\n\nCritically, we priced ahead of inflation, balancing growth (GWP was higher by 2%) with the maintenance of pricing and underwriting discipline. This helped us to partly mitigate the headwinds of inflation and increased claims frequency.\n\nThe HNW market is a priority in B2B and, in part due to our growth in that market, we now enjoy the number one position in the UK home insurance market.\n\nIn October, we became the UK partner for Lemonade, with a focus on growing share of an underserved renters market and gaining insight into leading customer data and AI techniques.\n\nIn addition, we continue to enjoy a leadership position in the UK bancassurance sector. Our long-term Home and Travel partnership with TSB Bank has been renewed for a further five years to 2028.\n\n2022 saw a material change in regulation with the introduction of the FCA's GI Pricing Practices, implemented on 1 January 2022. In complying with the new rules, we have concurrently balanced pricing, profit and volume.\n\nIn service, we have maintained our relationship NPS lead on the market and enjoy TNPS scores in the mid-30s for our main brands. Our digital credentials continue to grow: more than 75% of Retail customers are using our digital channels, and a third of customer support enquiries are being handled by intelligent virtual assistance.\n\nWe also continue to cut complexity from our business, removing a further 106 products this year and around 300 since the end of 2019.\n\nThese changes are customer focused, improving experience through augmented digital journeys as well as improving our agility and ability to compete in a highly price-competitive market.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Aviva Canada continues to show resilience through this inflationary environment, in large part due to our focus on improving underlying performance over the last few years. Significant focus and resources have been dedicated to monitor the macro-environment and act swiftly as a business. Our outlook on 2023 performance continues to be strong.\n\nIn 2022 we have seen more people driving again, as provinces lifted restrictions from COVID-19, albeit still below pre-COVID levels. Consumers have also continued to shift towards digital channels continuing a trend that has been evident for the last few years, and accelerated by the pandemic. Brokers and carriers are building digital capabilities and technological change is a top priority for insurers, including Aviva.\n\n## Personal lines\n\nOur Personal insurance portfolio (CAD$4 billion, 62% of overall business mix) is largely made up of mass market propositions, particularly in regulated lines/geographies.\n\nOur retail and group business is predominantly sold by brokers and by RBC Insurance, the most recognised financial services brand in Canada. Here, our focus is to improve pricing sophistication and operational efficiency. Our market-leading lifestyle products, such as watercraft, recreational vehicles (RV), classic cars and snowmobiles, continue to be a profitable growth driver and our product range, expertise, broker relationships and best-in-class claims service set us apart in the market.\n\nOur focus continues to be on margin preservation through rate adequacy in personal lines. We continue to leverage our expertise in data science, pricing sophistication and indemnity management to maintain performance. In addition, we are focusing on increasing customer digital interactions for sales and service in order to deliver value to our customers and drive efficiency.\n\nIn 2022 we launched a new telematics offering for our brokers in Ontario - Aviva Journey - which has seen strong uptake in this initial phase of our public rollout. In the third quarter we also launched an electric vehicle product which has been well\n\nreceived by our distribution partners and customers. We are innovating in response to customer and broker needs, and in support of our sustainability ambition.\n\nOur investment in Digital Direct is ensuring that our Direct book grows rapidly and sustainably, with 49.5% revenue growth in 2022.\n\nOur personal insurance retail segment is highly commoditised and cyclical. In 2023 growth is projected to be in line with the market (i.e. low single digit). We are focused on delivering above-market growth in our Direct channel as well as in our speciality lines, where we have marketleading expertise.\n\n## Commercial lines\n\nOur commercial lines are divided into AB businesses (19% of overall segment) and GCS businesses (20%). Our commercial lines business is a focus of our growth ambition, and we see opportunities for growth across AB and GCS.\n\nWithin AB we are focusing on value growth over policy-count growth by targeting new business with a high average premium. We are gaining traction on our strategy with growth in Medium Enterprise and MidMarket proposition.\n\nWithin GCS we have been expanding our attainable market by building new capabilities and processes. We have started to build a fronting business, where we take a risk-free margin by selling Aviva-branded insurance in which the insured risks are ceded to a reinsurer. We're also establishing ourselves as a multinational insurer, by\n\noffering insurance for the globally domiciled operations of Canadian customers. We recognise the value of frequent and highquality interactions with our customers, leveraging the strength of our people.\n\nAcross commercial lines we are building deeper, more meaningful relationships with brokers and positioning to grow through differentiated service via operational efficiency, attractive pricing, and underwriting expertise. We are also helping Canadian businesses to protect themselves against severe weather events by providing weather index-triggered insurance coverage - GCS Parametric Solutions - which pays out based on published indices.\n\nDespite the pressures of inflation, and challenges posed by macroeconomic developments, we overcame these headwinds to achieve significant GWP growth of 14% in commercial lines in 2022, on a constant-currency basis (22% GBP, as reported). Looking ahead, we are committed to maintaining underwriting discipline, and we we are focused on delivering strong premium and customer growth in our target segments through 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In response we have introduced a number of initiatives, for example launching Aviva-Auto care centres (car body shops) aimed at providing better outcomes in customer experience and indemnity management.\n\n## Distribution channels\n\nIn Canada, we have a strong, long-standing relationship with our network of over 800 independent brokers and a partnership with RBC, the largest bank and most valuable brand in Canada 1 .\n\nIn 2022 we have undergone an IT transformation that has significantly changed how we deliver technology change.

In 2022 our relative investment performance has been negatively impacted by the exceptional market environment which included rapidly rising interest rates and outperformance of sectors such as energy. Nevertheless, against this market backdrop, our investment performance has remained resilient with 51% (2021: 69%) of AUM exceeding benchmark over one year and 50% (2021: 65%) over three years.\n\nNet flows excluding strategic actions 3 and liquidity were \u00a342 million (2021: \u00a31.5 billion). Positive external net flows were resilient in light of difficult market conditions at \u00a31.3 billion (2021: \u00a33.3 billion), reflecting the diversity of our business with strong demand for our real assets capabilities more than offsetting a weak market for liquid strategies. Reduction in internal net outflows to \u00a3(1.3) billion (2021: \u00a3(1.8) billion) reflects demand for new ESG solutions.\n\nOur Aviva client distribution channels mainly comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 Wealth, where we develop ESG-focused propositions to meet the long-term savings needs of Aviva's pension and savings customers; and\n- \u00b7 Aviva shareholder, where we develop investment solutions to support Aviva's growth ambitions, primarily in the UK BPA and individual annuity markets.\n\nOur external client distribution channels include:\n\n- \u00b7 Large asset owners, including insurance companies, consultants, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds;\n- \u00b7 Global financial institutions such as large private banks; and\n- \u00b7 UK wholesale intermediaries to retail customers, such as independent financial advisers and wealth managers.\n\n## Key priorities for 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Continued improvement in investment performance to deliver enhanced investment returns for our clients;\n- \u00b7 Capitalising on growth opportunities within Aviva Group and externally through our strengths in ESG, real assets, multiassets, sustainable equities and credit; and\n- \u00b7 Ongoing focus on simplifying our business to deliver efficiency benefits and improvements in the cost income ratio.\n- 1.

The table shows the movement in centre liquidity over the year.\n\nCentre liquidity as at end of February 2023 is \u00a32,220 million (February 2022: \u00a36,644 million) with the decrease primarily driven by the the \u00a33,750 million capital return during 2022 and ordinary dividends to external shareholders, offset by cash remittances.\n\n| Centre Liquidity                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash remittances                                                  | 1,845     | 1,899     |\n| External interest paid                                            | (355)     | (388)     |\n| Internal interest paid                                            | (30)      | (40)      |\n| Central spend                                                     | (397)     | (432)     |\n| Other operating cash flows 1                                      | 88        | 62        |\n| Excess centre cash inflow                                         | 1,151     | 1,101     |\n| Ordinary dividend                                                 | (828)     | (841)     |\n| Net reduction in borrowings                                       | (419)     | (2,035)   |\n| Disposal proceeds                                                 | -         | 6,150     |\n| Share buyback                                                     | (147)     | (853)     |\n| Capital return                                                    | (3,750)   | -         |\n| Net reduction/(increase) in internal borrowings                   | 500       | (708)     |\n| Other non-operating cash flows 2                                  | (931)     | (255)     |\n| Movement in centre liquidity                                      | (4,424)   | 2,559     |\n| Centre liquidity as at end of February 2023 and 2022 respectively | 2,220     | 6,644     |\n\n- 1.

The corporate bond spread sensitivity is applied such that even though movements vary by rating and duration consistent with the approach in the solvency capital requirement, the weighted average spread movement equals the headline sensitivity. Fundamental spreads remain unchanged.\n- 2. An immediate full letter downgrade on 20% of the annuity portfolio credit assets (e.g. from AAA to AA, from AA to A)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAs part of the Group's internal capital management process, we regularly monitor the Group's sensitivity to economic and non-economic scenarios.\n\nThe table shows the absolute change in Solvency II shareholder surplus and cover ratio under each sensitivity, e.g. a 2pp positive impact would result in the Solvency II shareholder cover ratio increasing from 212% to 214%.\n\nAs a result of the capital deployment, the sensitivity of the Solvency II shareholder cover ratio to economic and non-economic assumptions typically reduces. The table shows the sensitivity impacts post deployment.\n\n## Limitations of sensitivity analysis\n\nThe table above demonstrates the effect of an instantaneous change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged. In reality, changes may occur over a period of time and there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration that the Group's assets and liabilities are actively managed. Additionally, the Solvency II position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group's financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.\n\nAs investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing\n\ninvestment portfolio allocations and taking other protective action.\n\nOther limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risks that only represent the Group's view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty and the assumption that all parameters move in an identical fashion.\n\n## Specific examples:\n\n- \u00b7 The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rates at all terms. These results should not be used to calculate the impact of non-parallel yield movements.\n- \u00b7 The sensitivity analysis assumes equivalent assumption changes across all markets i.e. UK and non-UK yield curves move by the same amounts, equity markets across the world rise or fall identically.\n\nAdditionally, the movements observed by assets held by Aviva will not be identical to market indices so caution is required when applying the sensitivities to observed index movements.\n\n## Stress and scenario testing\n\nIn addition to our sensitivity analysis, stress and scenario testing (including reverse stress testing) is used to test the resilience of business plans and to inform decision-making.\n\nThe results of this testing demonstrates that through the use of key management actions (including expense management, hedging and capital raising) the Group can maintain sufficient liquidity and surplus of Solvency II own funds over SCR to withstand a variety of severe scenarios and stresses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The split of SCR by risks is summarised in the chart.\n\nThe SCR has decreased by \u00a31.3 billion to \u00a37.8 billion since 31 December 2021 primarily due to an increase in interest rates over the period which affect several risks through the impact of discounting.\n\n## Solvency II regulatory own funds by Tier and Solvency II debt leverage ratio\n\nOne of the objectives of capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure using a combination of equity shareholders' funds, preference share\n\ncapital, subordinated debt and borrowings, in a manner consistent with our risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business.\n\nThe table provides a summary of the Group's regulatory Solvency II own funds by Tier and Solvency II debt leverage ratio.\n\nSolvency II debt leverage ratio at 31 December 2022 is 31% (2021: 27%). The increase is primarily due to the decrease in regulatory own funds following the completion of the \u00a33.75 billion capital return to ordinary shareholders during the first half of 2022 and interest rate increases over the period. The Group redeemed a net \u00a30.5 billion of debt in the period.\n\n| Regulatory view                   | 2022 \u00a3m   | % of own  funds 2022   | 2021 \u00a3m   | % of own  funds 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|\n| Solvency II regulatory debt 1     | 5,210     |                        | 6,330     |                        |\n| Senior notes                      | 687       |                        | 651       |                        |\n| Commercial paper                  | 252       |                        | 50        |                        |\n| Total debt                        | 6,149     |                        | 7,031     |                        |\n| Unrestricted Tier 1 2             | 13,162    | 70%                    | 19,120    | 75%                    |\n| Restricted Tier 1 3               | 946       | 5%                     | 967       | 4%                     |\n| Tier 2 4                          | 4,264     | 23%                    | 5,363     | 21%                    |\n| Tier 3 5                          | 296       | 2%                     | 123       | -%                     |\n| Total regulatory own funds        | 18,668    |                        | 25,573    |                        |\n| Solvency II debt leverage ratio 6 | 31%       |                        | 27%       |                        |\n\n- 1.

Where this statement draws upon information contained in other sections of the Strategic report, this is signposted accordingly 1 .\n\nOur Board considers it crucial that the Company maintains a reputation for high standards of business conduct. The Board is responsible for establishing, monitoring and upholding the culture, values, standards, ethics and reputation of the Company to ensure that our obligations to our shareholders, employees, customers and others are met. The Board monitors adherence to our policies and compliance with local corporate governance requirements across the Group and is committed to acting where our businesses fall short of the standards we expect.\n\nOur Board is also focused on the wider social context within which our businesses operate, including those issues related to climate change which are of fundamental importance to the planet's well-being.\n\nA detailed explanation of how Aviva continues to manage the impact of its business on communities and the environment is outlined in the 'Our Sustainability ambition' section of the Strategic report.\n\n## Our culture\n\nOur culture is shaped by our clearly defined purpose - to be with you today for a better tomorrow. As the provider of financial services to millions of customers, Aviva seeks to earn their trust by acting with integrity and a sense of responsibility at all times. We look to build relationships with all stakeholders based on openness and transparency. We value diversity, equity and inclusivity in our workforce and beyond, and the 'Our people' section of the Strategic report sets out how that underpins everything we do.\n\n## Key strategic decisions in 2022\n\nFor each matter, the Board considers the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, identifies stakeholders who may be affected, and carefully considers their interests and any potential impact as part of the decision-making process. The key strategic decisions taken during 2022 were informed and supported by stakeholder engagement activities as set out in this section.\n\nOn 2 March 2022, following the programme of divestment in 2021, we announced a \u00a33.75 billion 'B Share Scheme' and share consolidation which completed in May 2022.\n\nThis followed on from the increased and extended \u00a31 billion share buyback programme completed on 31 March 2022.\n\nWe have subsequently announced a further \u00a3300 million share buyback. This brings the total capital returned to shareholders to over \u00a35 billion since 2021. In addition to the return of capital to shareholders, the Board also approved the redemption of the Aviva plc 6.125 % \u00a3800 million fixed rate perpetual reset subordinated notes at the first call date on 29 September 2022.\n\nOn 2 March 2022, the Board announced the acquisition of Succession Wealth (a leading national independent financial advice firm) in order to enhance significantly our position in the fast-growing wealth market. The transaction successfully completed in August 2022. Succession Wealth's advisers can now access Aviva's platforms and our customers are benefiting from the competitive offering and highquality service. The Board continues to consider, where appropriate, potential bolton acquisition candidates that would complement our target growth areas. During 2022, we have monitored and responded to the impact that inflationary pressures have exerted on our customers, our people, and our communities.\n\nIn response to our customers' needs we launched our 'Essentials' products on Quotemehappy, a range of low cost general insurance products to provide an essential\n\nlevel of cover for our customers. Following colleague feedback on the impact of the cost of living crisis we supported colleagues in the UK with one-off cost of living payments and made similar payments to our colleagues in Canada and Ireland. On 27 October 2022, we pledged to invest \u00a37 million and \u00a32 million respectively to our new partnership charities Citizens Advice and Money Advice Trust's Business Debtline to support their services in this period of unprecedented need.\n\nThe Board has continued to support Aviva's Sustainability Ambition into 2023, in a number of areas. This included committing \u00a338 million to The Wildlife Trust for the rebuilding of the Celtic Rainforests. Aviva Ireland also announced the donation of \u20ac5 million to the Nature Trust to help accelerate its native afforestation project. This is part of a \u00a3100 million programme of nature-based projects in the UK and Ireland to help address climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These investments are aligned to our goal of reinvesting 2 % of our group adjusted operating profit in our communities as part of our Sustainability Ambition. We were proud to be recognised as the leading insurance company in the World Benchmarking Alliance 2022 Financial System Benchmark 2 .\n\n- 1.

Making Aviva a really great place to work, offering fantastic development and careers, now and in the future, has been our priority.'\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe people function is focused on unleashing the power of our people to deliver our strategy for our customers, colleagues and shareholders.\n\n## Engaging our people\n\nIn our 2022 Voice of Aviva colleague listening survey 86% of colleagues said they would recommend Aviva as a great place to work. Amid our ongoing transformation as a business, and despite the uncertain socioeconomic environment, our employee engagement levels have significantly improved since 2021 and Aviva sits well above the financial services benchmark.\n\nUnderstanding of the Group's strategy is strong and perceptions of flexibility and workload sustainability have improved. Feedback on the frequency and quality of individual talent and performance conversations is also positive, and these remain a critical lever to support employee progression, performance and engagement. While we have made headway on perceptions of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion we need to improve visible representation in leadership.\n\nIn response to the 2022 survey, we will focus on our ability to adapt to change quickly and continue to help people connect to our strategy through communications and engagement approaches, owned by senior leaders.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nOur ambition is for people to be able to be themselves at Aviva, and for our workforce to reflect the customers and communities we serve. It's a fundamental part of living up to our purpose and values, key to continuing as a sustainable, successful business and contributes to a more equal society. In the Voice of Aviva survey 86% of colleagues responded that they 'can be themselves at work'.\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion is woven into everything we do, from employee policies to customer propositions to relationships with suppliers and partners, supported by leaders owning and driving this agenda. Inclusion across all communities is important, and we are particularly focused on gender and ethnicity. We've set ourselves the targets of increasing female senior leadership to 40% and ethnically diverse senior leadership to 13% by 2024. Our Executive Long-Term Incentive Plans are tied to performance against these targets, reinforcing our commitment to action and driving sustainable change. Our work on gender is underpinned by our market-leading approach to equal parental leave and we continue to champion our Ethnically Diverse Leadership programme and Reverse Mentoring Programmes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022 we launched three programmes to specifically help our diverse colleagues thrive and advance their careers. The Mission Include and Mission Gender Equity crosscompany mentoring programmes for 80 colleagues, in partnership with Moving Ahead, focused on building and strengthening our diverse pipeline. The Aviva Sponsorship Programme, in partnership with School for CEOs, is pairing 130 sponsees with sponsors across Aviva. The pilot saw 54% of sponsees promoted or appointed into stretch roles.\n\nWe have been recognised through numerous awards including achieving Gold Employer status in Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index, ranking in the top 15 for the Social Mobility Index and appearing in the Sunday Times Top 50 Employers for Women for the fifth consecutive year. A number of our people were also recognised on the HERoes, OUTstanding and EMpower Role Mode lists.\n\nAs a Disability Confident Employer, we interview every disabled applicant who meets the minimum criteria for the job and offer Workplace Adjustment Passports to all colleagues.\n\n86%\n\nof colleagues recommend Aviva as a great place to work",

This has been recognised by Hospice UK who awarded us their first Gold Standard in the Compassionate Employer scheme.\n\n## Leadership and learning\n\nUpskilling and reskilling our people to ensure Aviva is ready for the future is one of our key priorities.\n\nIn 2022, 200 leaders participated in our Courage to Lead programme, designed to drive a step-change by equipping and supporting leaders to take bold decisions and inspire their teams. Courage to Lead will be cascaded to our top 1,000 leaders during 2023.\n\nAll our people accessed Aviva University, our learning platform, at least once in 2022 with around 50% of colleagues accessing it each month, and an average of 16 hours learning per colleague this year. Our Learning at Work Week was focused on 'getting your dream job and super charging your development', and over 4,500 colleagues participated in Skillsfest, focused on the capabilities our people need both now and in the future.\n\n## Our plans for 2023\n\nWe have the foundations in place to help Aviva deliver its commitments to our customers, colleagues and shareholders through our people.\n\nIn 2023 we will:\n\n- \u00b7 Help colleagues put customers at the forefront of our decisions and the way we work;\n- \u00b7 Continue to build and enable the workforce of the future;\n- \u00b7 Maintain momentum on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion;\n- \u00b7 Push our Courage to Lead leadership training through the organisation;\n- \u00b7 And grow our Aviva University curriculum with learning for all.\n\nThe average number of full-time equivalent employees during 2022 was 23,701 (2021: 22,312).

Our minimum rate of pay means our colleagues can make an 8% pension contribution (benefitting from the 14% employer contribution) while still taking home the Real Living Wage.\n\nIn October we made a one-off payment to over 9,000 colleagues across Aviva. While the payment didn't benefit everyone, it was focussed where we believed it would have the most impact.\n\nWe also removed office car parking charges, provided free lunches to employees' children over the holidays and gave colleagues access to free flu vaccinations. We also offer our people a range of flexible benefits including employee rates for Aviva products, discounted shopping and financial advice.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Net Zero ambition covers three scopes of emissions:\n\n- \u00b7 Scope 1 covers direct sources e.g. fuels used to power our buildings and company cars;\n- \u00b7 Scope 2 is focused on energy generated elsewhere and supplied to our business; and\n- \u00b7 Scope 3 focuses on indirect emissions e.g. from our supply chain, business investments, and underwriting and investment portfolios.\n\nQuantifying the impact of climate change is an emerging practice. It is challenging to obtain consistent asset data across our entire portfolio and quantify the impact of carbon emissions from our scope 3 category 15 financial investments. We have made several methodology improvements in 2022 and will continue to enhance our capabilities in line with industry developments and standards.\n\nWe have an ambitious climate transition plan for our journey to Net Zero by 2040, yet no one can achieve Net Zero on their own. We need governments and international\n\ninstitutions to develop their own plans to enable the global transition.\n\nIn December 2022, Aviva became the first international composite insurer to have carbon reduction goals validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)\u00b9.\n\nAviva's targets\u00b2 include commitments to:\n\n- \u00b7 Achieve a 90% reduction in absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 levels;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that 70% of suppliers (by spend) will have science-based targets by 2025;\n- \u00b7 Ensure that a third of shareholder, WithProfits and Aviva Investors Discretionary Mandate equity, bonds and loans portfolio by invested value have science-based targets by 2025;\n- \u00b7 Continue financing only renewable electricity in electricity generation project finance portfolio until 2030; and\n- \u00b7 Reduce real estate portfolio greenhouse gas emissions by 57% per square metre by 2030 compared to 2019 levels.\n\nWe will update our Climate Transition Plan to include the implementation and progress of our science-based targets and we will develop further baselines and targets in 2023 in due course.\n\n## Carbon reductions in our operations\n\nWe have achieved a 43% reduction in our operational carbon emissions against our 2019 baseline. Now we are focused on our ambition to make our operations and supply chain Net Zero by 2030.\n\nWe currently offset any remaining operational emissions, ensuring that our business continues to remain 'carbon neutral'.\n\nIn 2015, we set ourselves the ambition of using electricity generated entirely from renewable sources in our own operations by 2025. In 2022, we achieved our goal and now 'match' all our electricity to renewable sources 3 .\n\n## Investments are the largest source of emissions\n\nFor Aviva, the investments we make for customers and shareholders are the largest source of emissions in our carbon value chain. Over 90% of our current emissions are part of Scope 3.\n\nWe have relationships with businesses and existing assets that may be associated with significant emissions, and know the economy-wide shift to Net Zero emissions requires a greater and deeper level of engagement between companies and their investors.\n\n## Focusing on the biggest emitters\n\nAs an asset owner, we can influence the global transition to lower-carbon economies through responsible investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Engagement Escalation programme, which started in 2021, involves engagement with the 30 largest systemically important carbon emitters in the world that contribute 30% of global Scope 3 emissions. We will work with them to act on positive climate transition, or we will withdraw our capital. The programme includes a five-step approach to discussions, with progress monitored twice a year over a three year period.\n\nDuring 2022, we engaged either individually or collaboratively on climate 345 times and voted on 159 resolutions related to climate issues.\n\n- 1. The SBTi Net Zero Standard defines corporate Net Zero as: (i) Reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions to zero or to a residual level that is consistent with reaching Net Zero emissions at the global or sector level in eligible 1.5\u00b0C-aligned pathways; (ii) Neutralising any residual emissions at the Net Zero target year and any GHG emissions released into the atmosphere thereafter.\n- 2. See Science Based Targets that Aviva has committed to https:// sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/Target-language-and-summary\\_Aviva-plc.docx.pdf\n- 3. Our business investments in China (Aviva CofCo) and Singapore (SingLife) are outside of our control boundary and do not count as our 'own operations'. These are international investments where we do not have any operational or financial control. As per the GHG Protocol, China and Singapore operations are accounted for under scope 3 Category 15 - investments. Note: 2010 goal was location based and 2019 to 2030 goal is market-based. f\n\n## Read more\n\nMore details can be found in the:\n\n- > Aviva Climate-related Financial Disclosure 2022\n- > Aviva Climate Transition Plan",

We are working initially with The Wildlife Trust, The Woodland Trust and The Nature Trust, and other major conservation groups in the UK, Canada and Ireland.\n\nConfirmed projects will reintroduce woodland across 3,000 hectares - removing around 1.4 million tonnes of carbon from the atmosphere in their lifetime- equivalent to the emissions created by driving over 4.2 billion miles.\n\n## Bringing back the UK's lost rainforests\n\nWe are re-establishing temperate rainforest across the UK. Native to the British Isles, temperate rainforest once stretched from Cornwall to the west of Scotland.\n\nIt now covers less than 1% of the UK and is thought to be more threatened than tropical rainforests. Working with the Wildlife Trust, we aim to re-establish this rare and biodiverse habitat by planting native tree species. The project will also bring biodiversity benefits by creating habitat that can support flora and wildlife.\n\n## A broad focus on biodiversity\n\nWe were the first UK insurer to commit to the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. As part of our commitment, we launched a Biodiversity Policy in 2021. The policy outlined a set of principles to guide our biodiversity decisions from 2021 onwards.\n\nIn 2022, we published a report to show the progress we made in our first year of our policy. It included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Carried out an assessment of deforestation risks in our investments and underwriting activities to understand our exposure to commodity-driven deforestation. These results will be used to inform our investor engagement programme with high risk companies on deforestation and inform our decision-making on insurance activities with associated deforestation risk.\n- \u00b7 Launched our first biodiversity themed global equity fund (the Nature Capital Transition Fund) to support the transition to a nature positive economy.\n- \u00b7 Played a leading role in the Finance for Biodiversity Foundation's delegation at COP15 to represent financial institutions, and make sure they have a defined role to play in reversing biodiversity loss by the end of the decade.\n- \u00b7 We strengthened our voting policy by making deforestation a more formal element. We now vote against targeted management resolutions at companies with exposure to deforestation risk when they lack robust policies and targets on reducing deforestation. We voted against 75 companies by August 2022 on this basis.\n\nThe World Benchmarking Alliance rated Aviva second out of 400 financial services companies globally.\n\nThe World Benchmarking Alliance (WBA) said of Aviva:\n\n- 'This financial institution is one of the few that is committed to minimising its negative impacts on nature and biodiversity across its financing activities.'\n\n## Read more\n\n- > Aviva Sustainability Report 2022\n- > Aviva Biodiversity Report 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

By end of 2022 we had helped an estimated 7.9 million people. In 2022 our community investment totalled over \u00a333.7 million\u00b9.\n\n## Financial resilience\n\nThe rising cost of living puts extra strain on our customers, our colleagues and the wider community. That's why in 2022 we announced millions of pounds of financial resilience funding to support our UK customers, colleagues and communities during 2022.\n\nAviva committed \u00a39 million to Citizens Advice and Money Advice Trust. These new partnerships gave the UK public increased access to free independent advice.\n\nAviva employees and families benefitted from 21,000 free kids' lunches during the summer holiday and over 9,400 colleagues received one-off cost of living payments.\n\nWe invest in communities through the Aviva Community Fund (ACF). In the UK, we have used the ACF platform to donate funds to over 7,800 good causes since 2015. In 2022, we added a \u00a32 million Cost of Living Boost to the Aviva Community Fund to support charities helping people tackle the cost of living challenge.\n\n## Responding to a humanitarian crisis\n\nWe've worked with the British Red Cross since 2016. In response to the crisis in Ukraine, we donated \u00a31.2 million to the DEC Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal, including the matching of employee and customer donations, to support the Red Cross Movement in accelerating their response and providing critical care to those who need it most. We also continued to contribute to the Red Cross Disaster Relief Alliance to enable their response to wider global disasters.\n\n## Environmental resilience\n\nOur Building Future Community reports and the Aviva Climate Ready Index, both call for greater government, business and crossindustry support to help protect communities and make the countries we operate within more climate ready.\n\nOur partnership with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is in its second year using natural land management to improve flood resilience. In the UK, Aviva and WWF work on a range of projects in Scotland, Yorkshire, East Anglia and the Midlands. One project is the River Soar in Leicestershire. This area is vulnerable to flooding. Through WWF we're funding innovative large natural floodmanagement initiatives that will create multiple benefits for nature, while building greater climate resilience within the wider community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## It takes partnership to tackle cost of living challenge\n\nIn 2022, Aviva launched two sector leading financial resilience partnerships. One with Citizens Advice and another with Money Advice Trust, two of the country's leading charities, providing financial support and debt advice across the UK.\n\nThese charities faced unprecedented levels of demand for advice and support.\n\nWe supported both organisations to significantly increase their capacity\n\n## Estimated 7.9m\n\npeople made more resilient from 1 January 2020 until 31 December 2022\n\n## Volunteering in the community\n\nIn total, our global employees contributed more than 41,610 volunteering hours to support local communities throughout 2022.\n\nto support hundreds of thousands of people up and down the UK.\n\nThrough Aviva's support:\n\n- \u00b7 Citizens Advice will help up to 250,000 more people over 2 years; and\n- \u00b7 Money Advice Trust will support an estimated 17,000 more small businesses and self-employed people through the Business Debtline.\n- 1.

We require all our people, at every level, to read and sign-up to our Code every year (99.6% of our employees did so in 2022).\n\nWe have a zero-tolerance approach to acts of bribery and corruption. We therefore have a risk management framework that sets out relevant policies and standards across all markets.\n\nThese apply to everyone at Aviva and it is the responsibility of CEOs (or equivalent) to ensure that their business operates in line with them.\n\nThe Financial Crime Business Standard, and supporting Minimum Compliance Standards, guide our risk-based financial crime programmes. These seek to prevent, detect and report financial crime, including any instances of bribery and corruption, while complying fully with relevant legislation and regulation.\n\nAt a Group level, the Chief Risk Officer provides the Risk Committee with regular reporting on financial crime matters.

        "page_content": "## Our Climate-related Financial Disclosure\n\n## Aviva recognises the value of disclosure as part of the journey to a more sustainable future.\n\nWe can control the decarbonisation of our own operations and supply chain, and can influence through the \u00a3352 billion in Assets under Management (AUM) that we have stewardship over, alongside the innovations and customers we support via our insurance.\n\n## Strategy\n\nTo deliver on our climate ambition, and reduce our exposure to climate-related risks, we focus on five key areas:\n\n## 1. Accountability and leadership\n\nWe advocate for systemic change to the international financial architecture so we can collectively deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. We collaborate across our industry and with global alliances.\n\n## 2. Decarbonising our investment portfolio\n\nAs an asset owner and a long-term savings and pensions provider and as an asset manager, we seek to align our investments with a pathway towards Net Zero emissions. It is our ambition to have a Net Zero portfolio by 2040. Aviva Investors is building a Climate Transition Fund range that helps investors support the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n## 3. Insuring a Net Zero future\n\nTo support the transition to a low carbon economy, we are developing products and services which reward customers for environmentally responsible actions across our global markets. We now offer a range of 34 different green and low carbon insurance propositions across our businesses. We have published our ESG Baseline Underwriting Statement which defines the activities we exclude as an insurer.\n\n## 4. Decarbonising our operations and supply chain\n\nWe have an ambition to be Net Zero in our operations and supply chain by 2030. Our operations have been carbon neutral since 2006, through reducing our emissions yearon-year and offsetting any remaining emissions. We have exceeded our long-term emissions reduction target of 70% by 2030, set in 2010. We are now aiming for Net Zero by 2030.\n\n## 5. Embedding climate in our culture\n\nESG considerations have been incorporated into decision-making processes at Aviva, and our staff pension scheme trustees aligned the scheme to be Net Zero by 2040.\n\n## Risk management\n\nAviva's risk management framework sets out how we identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on the risks to which our business is, or could be, exposed to (including climate-related risks and other sustainability risks). We use our risk identification process to identify potential exposure to climate-related risks via the associated physical and transition\n\ntransmission channels (for example new climate policies or increases in average temperatures). We then conduct exposure analysis to understand how these risks will impact our most material exposures. The principal risks impacted by climate change are credit risk, market risk, general insurance risk and life insurance risk.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to build our climate risk capability and integrate it into our governance, strategy, risk management, and disclosure as well as to develop our associated metrics and targets, to support better understanding, monitoring and reporting as well as ensure climate-related risks and opportunities are embedded in our day-to-day decision making in line with our climate risk appetite.\n\nSee 'Our risks and risk management' section for further information.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nAviva has developed and expanded the climate metrics reported in 2021. This includes reporting absolute emissions and economic carbon intensity for credit and equities (in addition to weighted average carbon intensity) and absolute emissions and carbon intensity for sovereign debt.\n\nWe also use scenario analysis as a tool for helping to identify the potential impact of climate change on an organisation and its end to end value chain.\n\nThe following table sets out the assets which are in-scope for our climate metrics compared to the AUM on the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position:\n\n| \u00a3bn                                                        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total assets for which  emissions are calculated           | 165    | 191    |\n| AUM on IFRS consolidated  statement of financial  position | 289    | 329    |\n| Coverage                                                   | 57%    | 58%    |\n\nA reconciliation of climate metrics to AUM on the IFRS consolidated statement of financial position and more information on our climate metrics, is included in the Metrics and Targets section of the Climate-related Financial Disclosure report.\n\n## Financed emissions\n\nFinanced emissions represent the carbon emissions of our investment portfolio (i.e. Aviva's share of Scope 3 category 15) from the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. We monitor the emissions of our investment portfolio for shareholder, with-profit funds and policyholder funds for credit and equities, which is our most significant asset class in category 15.\n\n## Operational emissions\n\nWe have set out below our GHG emissions on an absolute CO 2 e basis in accordance with the Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR). The 2021 comparatives have been re-presented to exclude the emissions for China which are presented under Scope 3 investments reporting, given there is no operational control.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All residual emissions have been offset.\n\n## Operational and financed emissions\n\nScope 1 emissions relate to our operations excluding electricity usage. Scope 2 emissions relate to electricity usage of our operations. Scope 3 emissions relate to the value chain across 15 different categories. Aviva is engaged with regulators, industry bodies, alliances and companies across multiple sectors to develop consistent and standardised frameworks and approaches to calculate Scope 3 emissions. Aviva reports Scope 3 emissions as follows:\n\n| Not yet reported                                                   | Category 1 - Purchased  goods and services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Included in  operational  carbon emissions                         | Category 3 - Fuel and energy-related  activities, Category 5 - Waste  generated in operations, Category 6 -  Business travel, Category 7 -  Employee commuting                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Aviva does not  engage in  activities linked  to these  categories | Category 2 - Capital goods, Category  4 - Upstream transportation and  distribution, Category 8 - Upstream  leased assets, Category 9 -  Downstream transportation and  distribution, Category 10 -  Processing of sold goods, Category  11 - Use of sold products, Category  12 - End-of-life treatment of sold  products, Category 13 - Downstream  leased assets, Category 14 - |\n| Included in  Financed                                              | Category 15 - Investments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n\n<!-- image -->",

We diversify these risks through our scale, the variety of the products and services we offer, and the channels through which we sell our products and services.\n\n## Our strategy for risk\n\nWe receive premiums which we invest to maximise risk-adjusted returns, so that we can fulfil our promises to customers while providing a return to our shareholders.\n\nIn doing so we prefer retaining risks we believe we are capable of managing to generate a return.\n\nLooking forward, the preferred risks we retain may be magnified or dampened by current and emerging external trends which may impact our current and longer-term profitability and viability, in particular our ability to write profitable new business.\n\nThe 'Principal emerging risk trends and causal factors' table in this section describes those trends, their impact, outlook and how we manage those emerging risks.\n\n## How we manage risk\n\nIn 2022, Stephen Gould was appointed as interim Group Chief Risk Officer (subject to regulatory approval). Stephen is a Partner in a Big Four professional services firm and a leading practitioner in risk management and risk culture in insurance. He is supporting the search underway for a permanent Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nEffective risk management is fundamental to the sustainable success of Aviva.\n\nAviva's risk management framework (RMF) is critical in supporting the business to deliver on Aviva's purpose for our customers, our people and our shareholders, helping the business discover, predict, understand and manage our risks, thereby maintaining a safe, sustainable and competitive risk and control environment.\n\nOur RMF is illustrated on the next page and comprises our systems of risk governance, risk and control management processes and risk appetite framework. It applies Group-wide, to embed a rigorous and consistent approach to risk management throughout the business.\n\nAviva's culture underpins all aspects of our RMF and makes sure different and balanced risk perspectives inform decision-making at Aviva. We monitor the effectiveness of our control consciousness and risk behaviours through feedback from our people throughout our businesses, regular assessment and industry benchmarking.\n\n## 1. Our risk management framework\n\nOur risk management framework (RMF) sets out our all-encompassing approach to risk management throughout Aviva. As illustrated on the figure to the left, our RMF is made up of several key components, including sub-frameworks for risk appetite and key risk categories, as well as our risk policy, governance, processes, procedures, systems and desired behaviours and attitudes for risk management.\n\n## 2. Our risk appetite framework\n\nOur risk appetite framework outlines the risks we select and manage in the pursuit of return, the risks we accept and retain at a moderate level as part of doing business and the risks we actively avoid or take action to mitigate as far as practical.\n\nOur risk appetites express the level of risk our business is willing to accept, are set at an aggregate level (sometimes covering multiple risk types) and act as hard constraints. The Group has risk appetites for solvency, liquidity, climate, operational, conduct and reputational risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our risk processes and systems\n\nThe processes and systems we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of our risk models, Operational Risk and Control Management System (ORCM) and stress and scenario testing, are designed to enable dynamic risk-based decision-making and effective day-to-day risk management. Having identified the risks to our business and measured their impact, depending on our risk appetite, we either accept these risks or take action to reduce, transfer or mitigate them.\n\n## 4. Risk and capital management\n\nThe Group's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) comprises all processes and procedures employed to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report the short-term and long-term risks Aviva faces or may face. The ORSA underpins the consideration of risk and capital implications in key decisions and, in particular, in strategy setting and business planning.\n\nFor robust and reliable financial reporting throughout the Group, we have in place Group reporting manuals in relation to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Solvency II reporting requirements and a Financial Reporting Control Framework (FRCF).\n\n## 5. Our risk governance approach\n\nOur governance approach includes risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees (both Board and management) and clearly defined roles and responsibilities.\n\nOur suite of risk policies sets out the Board's expectations for the management of risk throughout the Group. The Group's suite of business standards sets out Aviva's required control objectives and minimum control requirements for effective internal control throughout the Group.\n\nThese control objectives include:\n\n- \u00b7 the business demonstrating a commitment to integrity and ethical behaviour and promotes Aviva's desired culture and values, including in relation to risk and control;\n- \u00b7 reducing future losses and detriment to customers arising from failures in operational risk management and controls; and\n- \u00b7 supporting reliable reporting on the operational risk and control environment at all levels of the business, to increase the confidence of the Board, Regulator and Customers in the effectiveness and efficiency of our operational processes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are acting now through our Sustainability Ambition to mitigate and manage its impacts both today and in the future.\n\nThrough these actions, we continue to build resilience to climate-related transition, physical and liability risks. The principal risks impacted by climate change are credit risk, market risk, general insurance risk, life insurance risk and operational risk.\n\nOur risk policies (including the risk management framework and ORSA) to explicitly cover climate and other sustainability risks and to integrate these risks in our risk and control management activities.\n\nThe Board has approved the climate business plan as well as the risk appetite which acts as an expression of the level of risk we are willing to accept.\n\nWe use a variety of metrics to identify, measure, monitor and report alignment with global or national targets on climate change mitigation and the potential financial impact on our business.\n\nWe have a very low appetite for climaterelated risks which could have a material negative impact upon our balance sheet and business model as well as our customers and wider society.\n\nWe actively seek to limit our exposure over time to the downside risks arising from the transition to a low carbon economy. We seek to identify and support solutions that will drive a transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy.\n\nWe seek to limit our net exposure to the more acute and chronic physical risks that will occur in the event the Paris Agreement target is not met. We actively avoid material exposure to climate litigation risks including greenwashing risk. We review and monitor our exposure to this risk taking into account rapidly evolving regulatory requirements.\n\nFor further details see our Climate-related Financial Disclosure 2022 report.\n\nThe Risk Committee engages with the Customer and Sustainability Committee on the Climate and wider Sustainability agenda. There are three Group-level management committees designed to assist members of the Aviva Executive Committee in the discharge of their delegated authorities and their accountabilities within the Aviva Governance Framework and in relation to their defined regulatory responsibilities: the Group Asset and Liability Committee; the Group Executive Risk Committee and the Group Disclosure Committee.\n\n## 6. Oversight and challenge\n\nThe risk function is committed to enabling Aviva to grow profitably, responsibly and sustainably through oversight and challenging how the first line optimises our risk exposure safely with a key focus on protecting our customers and society for a better tomorrow. This is delivered through our risk leadership team specialising in financial risk, non-financial risk (including IT, cyber, climate and conduct), and consists of our Market CROs and risk directors. The risk function has been proactive on key initiatives around climate risk and the Consumer Duty Regulations in the year.\n\n## Three lines of defence\n\n## First line of defence\n\n## Line management\n\nAccountable for the implementation and practice of risk management.

All of the inherent risks to our business described below, and in particular operational risks, may have an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. Our exposure to these risks and mitigating actions are set out in detail in note 58.\n\n## Types of risk inherent to our business model:\n\n## Risks customers transfer to us\n\nLife insurance risk includes longevity risk (annuity customers living longer than we expect), mortality risk (customers with life protection), expense risk (the amount it costs us to administer policies) and persistency risk (customers lapsing or surrendering their policies). Specific actions we have taken to mitigate life insurance risk include use of reinsurance on longevity risk for our annuity business and the staff pension scheme.\n\nGeneral insurance risk arises from loss events (for example, fire, flooding, windstorms, accidents) and inflation (on expenses and claims). Health insurance exposes the Group to morbidity risk (the proportion of our customers falling sick) and medical expense inflation. Specific actions we have taken to mitigate general insurance risk include use of reinsurance to reduce the financial impact of a catastrophe and manage earnings volatility.\n\nAsset management risk is the risk of customers redeeming funds, not investing with us, or switching funds, resulting in reduced fee income.  Specific actions we have taken to mitigate asset management risk include investment performance and risk management oversight and review process; and client relationship teams managing client retention risk.\n\n## Risks arising from our investments\n\nCredit risks (actual defaults and market expectation of defaults) create uncertainty in our ability to offer a minimum investment return on our investments. Specific actions we have taken:\n\n- \u00b7 credit limit framework imposes limits on credit concentration by issuer, sector and type of instrument;\n- \u00b7 investment restrictions on certain sovereign and corporate exposures; and\n- \u00b7 credit risk hedging programme and asset de-risking. Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments when they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. In September 2022, we experienced one of the largest liquidity squeezes in recent times. Specific actions we have taken to mitigate this risk include:\n- \u00b7 maintain borrowing facilities from banks, commercial paper issuance and contingency funding plans; and\n- \u00b7 minimum liquidity buffers and intergroup funding helped enable us to meet collateral calls in the year because of the sharp interest rate rises.\n\nMarket risks result from fluctuations in asset values, including equity prices, property prices, foreign exchange, inflation and interest rates. Specific actions we have taken to mitigate this risk include:\n\n- \u00b7 ongoing review of strategic asset allocations; and\n- \u00b7 active asset management and hedging.\n\n## Risks from our operations and other business risks\n\nOperational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, (including those outsourced to third parties), people and systems, or external events including changes in the regulatory environment.\n\nConduct risk is the risk of causing harm to our customers, the markets in which we operate and/or our regulatory relationships.\n\nSpecific actions we have taken to mitigate these risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 implementation plans for new Consumer Duty Regulations;\n- \u00b7 actively monitoring the cyber and data threat environment leading to actions enhancing the IT infrastructure and cyber controls to identify, detect and prevent attacks; and\n- \u00b7 supplier oversight and continuity plans in case of third party supplier failure.",

While interest rate exposures are complex, we aim to  closely duration-match assets and liabilities and take  additional measures to limit interest rate risk. We hold  substantial capital against market risks, and we protect our  capital with a variety of hedging strategies to reduce our  sensitivity to shocks. We regularly monitor our exposures  and employ both structured and ad-hoc processes to  evaluate changing market conditions. Liquidity is managed  through maintaining sufficient buffers and taking through  asset sales or intergroup funding where required.                                                                                | The current economic uncertainty continues to pose  trading risks (for example, lower margins) to the business.

The Group's multi-channel distribution and product  strategy and geographic diversification, although reduced  following the divestment programme, underpin the Group's  adaptability to public policy risk, and often provides a  hedge to the risk.

Despite  continued medical advances emerging, dietary changes,  increasing obesity and strains on public health services  have slowed the historical trend since around 2011.

an ageing workforce and  new technologies requiring new skills  will make recruitment, retention and  investing in talent increasingly  important.                                                                                                                     | Increasing | Operational risk                                                                                                                        | To attract and retain top talent we have various internal  talent development programmes, a broad variety of  graduate and apprentice schemes and a range of diversity,  equity and inclusion initiatives, including gender and  sponsorship programmes. Our 'Aviva University' promotes  life-long learning for colleagues supporting development of  skills in key areas such as our customers, data and digital  interactions. We have launched a new career compass to  enable colleagues to have brilliant career conversations as  well as a Data Academy. Our retention measures include  innovative policies such as flexible working and equal  parental leave as well as providing great leadership and  career progression for our people.                                                                                                                                    | We expect technology and automation to increasingly change  the skills required for our workforce, and the pace of change will  accelerate the required reskilling of existing workforces and  recruitment of new talent. Our voluntary attrition has remained  consistent throughout 2022, tracking below the Financial  Services industry average. Our latest colleague survey results  are very positive with engagement rising to 86%, with 84% of  colleagues saying they intend to stay with Aviva for at least the  next 12 months. Recruitment and retention will become more  challenging as the relative size of the working-age population  declines, education systems fail to produce future generations  with the right skills in sufficient numbers and immigration  controls restrict the talent pool. Expectations of the next  generation of employees (i.e. Generation Z) will require us to  change how we operate if we are to retain talent. |\n| Pandemic - in an increasingly  globalised world, new or mutations  of existing bacteria or viruses may be  difficult for stretched healthcare  systems to contain, disrupting  national economies and affecting  our operations and the health and  mortality of our customers. | Stable     | Life Insurance  risk (mortality,  longevity,  morbidity),  General  Insurance  (business  interruption,  travel) and  Operational risk. | We have contingency plans which are designed to reduce  as far as possible the impact on operational service arising  from mass staff absenteeism, travel restrictions and supply  chain disruption caused by a pandemic, which we were  able to put into action during the recent COVID - 19  pandemic. We reinsure much of the mortality risk arising  from our life protection business and hold capital to cover  the risks of a 1-in-200 year pandemic event. We model a  range of extreme pandemic scenarios including a repeat  of the 1918 global influenza pandemic and COVID-19. In the  Group and commercial insurance business we manage  our potential exposure through our policy wordings.  As an investment manager and investor, we engage with  companies on the responsible use of antibiotics to reduce  the risk that antimicrobial resistance negates the efficacy | As COVID-19 becomes endemic its long-term impact on  mortality and morbidity is uncertain and dependent  on the extent natural immunity develops in the general  population, the efficacy of new healthcare treatments  and possible future strains that may emerge. This includes  the long-term effects of Long-COVID. Legal uncertainty over the outcome of business interruption  claims litigation arising from the COVID-pandemic is  expected to persist for a number of years. Trends such as global climate change, urbanisation,  antimicrobial resistance and intensive livestock production  are likely to increase the risk of future pandemics, while  reductions in migration and international travel as a result  of COVID-19 have largely reversed making the containment  of future pandemics more challenging.

This includes preventing, addressing  and remediating any potential adverse  human rights impacts in our  operations, our business activities and  relationships, and our investments. We  continue to pursue our anti-modern  slavery agenda within our operations  and supply chain, and through our  partnerships. In 2022 we refreshed our  wider human rights approach  following our last biennial, Group-wide  human rights due diligence  assessment.

BSR will  specifically support the ongoing  development of our Human Rights and | We will always seek to protect our  customers, shareholders, employees  and communities from financial crime. We have a zero-tolerance approach to  acts of bribery and corruption. All Group offices must comply with our  Financial Crime Business Standard  and associated Minimum Compliance  Standards, which include robust anti- bribery and corruption requirements  based on the UK Bribery Act.  Our Business Ethics Code strictly  prohibits any person associated with  the Group from doing anything that  supports, encourages or facilitates  bribery and corruption. |\n| Read more in  Our sustainability  ambition and Our Climate-related  Financial Disclosure sections of  this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Read more in Our people section of  this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Read more in Our sustainability  ambition section of this report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Read more in this report under Our  support for human rights.

It helps promote the long-term, sustainable success of the company, and ensures we consider the views and interests of the Group's wider stakeholders.\n\nGeorge Culmer Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'During the year the Board approved a substantial return of capital to shareholders, the repayment of debt and further investment in our business to promote growth and better support our customers.'\n\n## Governance and strategy at Aviva\n\nOur Governance report sets out how the Board and its Committees operated during 2022. Our role is to set the strategy and to ensure that Aviva continues to deliver on that strategy.\n\nAs evidence of that focus on delivery, during the year the Board approved a substantial return of capital to shareholders, repayment of debt, and further investment in our business to promote growth and better support our customers.\n\nThe Board also approved the acquisition of Succession Wealth and the high-networth business of Azur. These acquisitions will support the longer-term growth of the business.\n\nAnd as a continuation of our previously stated proposal to return surplus capital to shareholders, I am pleased that the Board has been able to confirm the \u00a3300 million share buyback programme first announced with the Half Year 2022 results.\n\nOf course 2022 was a challenging year with the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis and the severe cost of living pressures.\n\nThe Board responded to these challenges in a number of ways. The period of increasing inflation and interest rates led to additional support for our most junior colleagues to help them adapt to the cost of living crisis and for our customers through developing new more affordable products and propositions. Accordingly we made a oneoff payment to colleagues in the UK and an equivalent payment to our colleagues in Canada and Ireland. In response to our customers' needs we supported the launch of our new 'Essential' range of products. The Board will continue to assess the impact of the cost of living crisis on both our colleagues and our customers in 2023.\n\n## The UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nAs a UK Premium Listed company, Aviva's governance framework is based on the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code). The Code is publicly available at www.frc.org.uk . Details of how we have applied the principles and complied with the provisions of the Code during 2022 are set out in this report and the Directors' Remuneration report. The Board can confirm that the Company was compliant with the Code throughout the financial year under review. We set out how we have applied the principles of the Code in this report and describe how we have engaged with our workforce and performed our duties under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 within the Strategic report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

I wish to thank Jason for his commitment and contribution during his time with us. Following the resignation of Jason, the Nomination and Governance Committee led the process to identify a replacement CFO, and on 5 September 2022 Charlotte Jones joined the Board.\n\nIn terms of Non-Executive Directors, on 21 February 2022 Andrea Blance joined the Board, and Mike Craston joined on 17 May 2022.\n\nFollowing the AGM on 9 May 2022, Patricia Cross and Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda retired from the Board. Patricia joined the Board in December 2013, and Bel\u00e9n in June 2015, and they served as Chairs of the Remuneration and Risk Committees respectively. I would like to thank Patricia and Bel\u00e9n for their contribution to the Board and for their leadership of these Committees during their tenure.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nThe Board is committed to having a diverse, equitable and inclusive membership. This helps ensure we have the range of perspectives and insight that is so important for good decision making. I am pleased that the Board meets the Parker Review target to have at least one director from an ethnic minority background and that women account for 42% of the current Board. In August 2022, we reviewed our Board Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement, articulating our commitment to diversity and setting out targets for women in leadership roles. I am pleased to report the Statement has been expanded to include socio-economic and educational backgrounds, and we published the revised Board Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement on our website in January 2023.\n\nMore information on diversity, equity and inclusion is set out in the Nomination and Governance Committee report.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board continues to assess and monitor the Group's culture. A culture diagnostic has been developed along with associated action plans, which the Board reviews annually. The culture diagnostic was updated during 2022 to add two further measures. The culture diagnostic combines employee sentiment with other employee and customer data and is in addition to our annual Voice of Aviva employee engagement survey.\n\n## Dividend\n\nIn light of our 2022 performance and resilient capital and liquidity, the Board has declared a final dividend of 20.7 pence per 32 17/19p ordinary share (2021: 14.7 pence), bringing the full year dividend in respect of the 2022 financial year to 31 pence per 32 17/19p ordinary share (2021: 22.1 pence per share).\n\n## George Culmer\n\nChair\n\n8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How we are governed continued\n\nIn order to ensure there is a clear division of responsibilities between the running of the Board and the running of the business, the Board has identified certain reserved matters for its approval. In relation to other matters, unless they are specifically reserved for shareholder approval in a general meeting, the Board delegates responsibility for these to our Group CEO, who then delegates responsibility for specific operations to members of the Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe Board has established committees to assist in fulfilling its oversight and other responsibilities, providing dedicated focus in these areas.\n\n## The Board\n\nAs at the date of this report the Board is comprised of a Non-Executive Chair, two Executive Directors, seven independent Non-Executive Directors and two NonExecutive Directors who are not considered independent. Details of the role of the Board and its committees are described in this section and the duties of the Board and of each of its committees are set out in their respective Terms of Reference (ToR). The committees' ToR can be found on the Company's website at www.aviva.com/ committees and are also available on request from the Group Company Secretary.\n\nThe ToR list both matters that are specifically reserved for decision by our Board and those matters that must be reported to it.\n\nThe Board delegates clearly defined responsibilities to its committees and reports from the Audit, Customer and Sustainability, Nomination and Governance, and Risk Committees are contained in this section. A report from the Remuneration Committee is included in the Directors' Remuneration report.\n\n## Division of responsibility\n\nConsistent with the Code and the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SMCR), role profiles for the Non-Executive Chair, Senior Independent Director (SID), Group CEO and Non-Executive Directors are all available at www.aviva.com/aboutus/roles .\n\nThe Chair is tasked with leadership of the Board, setting its agenda, ensuring its effectiveness, and enabling the constructive challenge of the performance and strategic plans of the Executive Directors by the NonExecutive Directors. The Chair also plays a key role in working with the Board to establish our culture, purpose and values. The Group CEO is the senior executive of the Company and has overall accountability for the development and execution of the Group's strategy in line with the policies and objectives agreed by the Board.\n\nThe role of the SID is to provide a sounding board for the Chair and to serve as an intermediary for the other directors where necessary. The SID should be available to shareholders should they have concerns they have been unable to resolve through normal channels, or when such channels would be inappropriate.\n\nThroughout the year the Chair held several meetings with the Non-Executive Directors without management present. Additionally, the SID met with the other Non-Executive Directors without the Chair present to discuss any matters they wished to raise and to review the Chair's performance.\n\n## Board independence\n\nDuring the year the Nomination and Governance Committee assessed the independence of the Non-Executive Directors to ensure that they are able to properly fulfil their roles on the Board and provide constructive challenge to the Executive Directors. The independence criteria set out in the Code was taken into account as part of the selection process for the two Non-Executive Directors who joined Aviva during 2022.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee determined that all Non-Executive Directors were free from any relationship or circumstances that could affect, or appear to affect, their independent judgement except Mike Craston and, for part of the year, Michael Mire. Mike Craston was appointed to the Board on 17 May 2022, and was not considered to be independent due to his previous executive role within Aviva Investors terminating within the five year period stipulated in the Code.\n\nThe Committee also carefully considered the continued independence of Michael Mire, who reached nine years tenure on 12 September 2022. As a result, and with effect from that date, Michael was no longer considered to be independent and stood down from the Risk and Remuneration Committees. The Nomination and Governance Committee reviewed the Board's tenure profile and the recent refreshment activity that had been undertaken.\n\nFollowing careful consideration, the Committee considered that Michael continues to provide constructive challenge and robust scrutiny of matters that are brought to the Board for consideration. Accordingly, while no longer considering Michael to be independent, the Committee recommended that Michael remain on the Board to provide continuity while the newer Board appointees fully embed in their roles. In line with the Code, over half of our Board members, excluding the Chair, are independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How we are governed continued\n\n## Time commitment\n\nIt is vital to the proper functioning of our Board and committees that each NonExecutive Director is able to commit sufficient time to their role in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. In January 2023 the Nomination and Governance Committee assessed the NonExecutive Directors' time commitment considering both the time required for the Aviva Board and Committee appointments and the number and nature of the Directors' external commitments and reported the outcome to the Board.\n\nIn particular the Nomination and Governance Committee carefully considered the time commitments for Shonaid Jemmett-Page, taking into account investor guidelines and voting policies and their application to Shonaid's current directorships.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed in detail her portfolio, her overall capacity and her Chair roles on two investment trusts, which have a lesser time commitment than other listed company roles. In addition, the Committee noted that on 24 October 2022 it was announced that Shonaid would retire from the board and as Chair of Greencoat UK Wind Plc at its 2023 AGM. Following its review, and noting her retirement from the Board of Greencoat UK Wind Plc, the Committee considered Shonaid to have sufficient time to dedicate to her role as an Independent Non-Executive Director of Aviva.\n\nThe Board also considered and approved a number of additional external director commitments. On 12 May 2022, George Culmer was appointed as Senior Independent Director at Rolls Royce plc, having previously served as a Non-Executive Director since January 2020.\n\nIn February 2022, Amanda Blanc was appointed Co-Chair of the UK Transition Taskforce, an organisation seeking to assist in the development of 'gold standard' private sector climate transition plans.\n\nOn 2 August 2022, Amanda was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of BP plc with effect from 1 September 2022, supporting BP as it transforms into an integrated energy company. Amanda was also appointed to the Remuneration Committee and the People and Governance Committee of BP plc from 1 January 2023.\n\nOn 4 July 2022, Mike Craston was appointed as Non-Executive Chair of ThomasLloyd plc.\n\nThe time commitment involved in these appointments were assessed by the Board who determined that George, Amanda and Mike all continued to have sufficient time to commit to the Aviva Board and their committee appointments. The SID reviewed the time commitment of the Chair as part of his annual review of the Chair's performance.\n\nDuring the year, all Non-Executive Directors have continued to demonstrate that they have sufficient time to devote to their present role within Aviva, including during any potential periods of corporate stress.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Company's Articles of Association allow the Board to authorise potential conflicts of interest that may arise and to impose such limits or conditions as are deemed necessary. The decision to authorise a conflict of interest can only be made by nonconflicted directors (those who have no interest in the matter being considered) and in making such a decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole. The Board continues to monitor and note any potential conflicts of interest that each Director may have and recommends to the Board whether these should be authorised and whether conditions should be attached to any such authorisation.\n\nThe directors are regularly reminded of their continuing obligations in relation to potential or actual conflicts of interest and are required to bi-annually review and confirm their external interests, which helps to determine whether they can continue to be considered independent.\n\nThe Board carefully considered any potential conflicts of interest in relation to the appointment of Amanda Blanc as an Independent Non-Executive Director of BP plc and Mike Craston as Non-Executive Chair of ThomasLloyd plc.\n\nIt determined that no actual conflicts existed at the time of the appointments, and that any conflicts that may later arise would be managed in accordance with the Group Conflicts of Interest Policy.\n\n## Independent advice\n\nAll directors have access to the advice and services of the Group Company Secretary in relation to the discharge of their duties on the Board and any committees they serve on. Furthermore, any directors may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense. During the year, no directors sought to do so.\n\nThe Company arranges appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions against its directors and has also entered into indemnities with its directors as described in the Directors' Report section of this report.\n\n## Induction, training and development\n\nA commitment to support the continuing development of all employees is a central part of Aviva's culture. Our directors are highly supportive of this and are committed to their own ongoing professional development. During 2022, the directors participated in internal training sessions on subjects including whistleblowing, climate change and sustainability, Consumer Duty regulation and IFRS 17. Further training sessions have been incorporated into the Board and Committee plans for 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This covered, amongst other matters, the current financial and operational plan; meeting packs and minutes from recent Board and Committee meetings; stakeholder engagement; organisation structure charts; a history of the Group; role profiles; and all relevant policies, procedures and other governance material. The induction also included meeting key members of the management team and the external and internal auditors. Any knowledge or skill enhancements identified during the directors' regulatory application process were also addressed through directors' induction programmes.\n\n## Board calendar\n\nDuring 2022, 20 Board meetings were held, of which 13 were scheduled meetings and seven were additional meetings called to approve certain strategic matters. In addition, the Board delegated responsibility for certain items to specially created Board Committees which met six times to discuss these items.\n\nIf any directors are unable to attend a meeting, they can communicate their opinions and comments on the matters to be considered via the Chair of the Board or the relevant Committee Chair.\n\nThe Board visited our York offices in April 2022, and the Perth office in September 2022.\n\nIn June 2022, the Board held its annual twoday strategy meeting at an offsite location to review progress against our strategic priorities and to consider how these should be further developed to ensure we deliver on our commitments to our shareholders and our wider stakeholders.\n\n## Communication with shareholders\n\nThe Company places considerable importance on communication with shareholders. The Executive Directors have an ongoing dialogue and a programme of meetings with institutional investors, fund managers and analysts which are managed by the Company's investor relations function. The Chair also meets with all the Group's major shareholders. At those meetings a range of issues is discussed within the constraints of information already made public to understand shareholders' perspectives. Shareholders' views are regularly communicated to the Board through reports from the Group CEO and Group CFO and weekly briefings from our corporate brokers and the Investor Relations function. The SID was available to meet with major investors to discuss any concerns that could not be resolved through normal channels. Further detail on our engagement with shareholders is set out in the 'Our Stakeholders' section of the Strategic Report.\n\n## 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe 2023 AGM will be held on Thursday 4 May 2023 and the Notice of AGM and related papers will be sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the meeting. To enable a diverse segment of our shareholder base to more easily attend our AGM, the meeting this year will be held in Norwich at the premises of Norwich City Football Club. The AGM provides a valuable opportunity for the Board to communicate with private shareholders. Shareholders are invited to ask questions related to the business of the meeting at the AGM and a presentation will be given on the Group's performance. Further details on the AGM are provided in the 'Shareholder Services' section of this report.\n\nOther disclosures relevant to our Board are included in this report and the reports of our Committees and in the Directors' report.\n\n## Systems for risk management and internal controls\n\nThe Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of shareholders, as well as taking account of other stakeholders including employees and customers. This includes putting in place throughout the Group an appropriate system of risk governance. To discharge this responsibility, the Board has established frameworks for risk management and internal control using a 'three lines of defence' risk governance model and reserves for itself the setting of the Group's risk appetite.\n\nIn-depth monitoring of the establishment and operation of prudent and effective key controls for assessing and managing the key risks associated with the Group's operations is delegated to the Risk, Customer and Sustainability and Audit Committees which report regularly to the Board. However, the Board retains ultimate responsibility for the Group's systems of risk management and internal control and has reviewed their effectiveness during the year.\n\nThe systems for risk management and internal control play a key role in the management of risks that may impact the fulfilment of the Board's objectives. They are designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of the Group failing to achieve its business objectives and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or losses. The systems are regularly reviewed and were in place for the financial year under review and up to the date of this report. They help the Group comply with the Financial Reporting Council's (FRC) guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting.\n\nAt the mid-year 2022, the Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, carried out a robust assessment of the Group's emerging and principal risks. This exercise was repeated in January 2023. The outcome of these assessments was reported to and discussed at the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How we are governed continued\n\nIn addition to these assessments, the Risk Committee monitored and assessed the principal risks facing the Group, the conclusions of which were also shared with and discussed by the Board. The assessments included those emerging risks that could impact the Group's business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity and therefore required management prioritisation and action. Specifically the Board considered the principal risks facing the Group when approving the Group business plan.\n\nIn 2022, the Risk Committee received updates on emerging risks and associated mitigating actions covering the developing conflict in Ukraine, cyber security, risks posed by climate change and sources of economic uncertainty, including inflation. The Customer and Sustainability Committee (previously the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee) also received updates on emerging threats to the Group's reputation and conduct risk profile.\n\nEmerging risks were also considered by the Risk Committee and management in the design of scenarios which are intended to stress test the Group's three-year business plan, recovery plan, climate change impacts, decisions on the return of capital to shareholders and operational resilience.\n\nAviva's approach to risk management together with the principal risks that face the Group are explained within the 'Our risks and risk management' section of the Strategic report.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\nAviva's risk management framework (RMF) is designed to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report the principal risks to the achievement of the Group's business objectives and is embedded throughout the Group.\n\nIt is codified through risk policies, business standards and risk management frameworks which set out the approach to risk management, risk appetite and the minimum requirements and key controls for the Group's operations.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nInternal controls facilitate effective and efficient operations, the development of robust and reliable internal reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. Group reporting manuals in relation to the latest International Financial Reporting Standards and Solvency II reporting requirements and a Financial Reporting Control Framework (FRCF) are in place across the Group.\n\nThe FRCF relates to the preparation of reliable financial reporting, covering IFRS, Solvency II, Alternative Performance Measures (APM) and local statutory reporting activity. The FRCF methodology leverages best practice, including consideration of elements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act (2002), relating to assessment of Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. The methodology follows a risk-based approach, considering the likelihood of material misstatement, with management identification of the areas of higher risk,\n\nassessment of design adequacy and operating effectiveness of related controls (documentation and testing), remediation of identified deficiencies (as required), reporting and certification over key financial reporting related controls.\n\nWe have a similar Non-Financial Reporting Control Framework (NFRCF) relating to the preparation of our climate and nonfinancial reporting disclosures.\n\nAny open financial reporting deficiencies are assessed for the Group as a whole, in isolation and in aggregate, considering the impact on the financial reporting control environment. Materiality is used to assess whether any deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our financial reporting control environment. The assessment is presented to the Group Audit Committee on a quarterly basis through reports on the identification and resolution of control deficiencies which are also shared with the external auditors.\n\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that, as of 31 December 2022, Aviva Group's internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\n\nDuring 2022, the Aviva Group has continued to focus on strengthening the internal controls, overseeing assurance over nonfinancial information, including sustainability and ESG disclosures, and in continuing to assess the impact from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation on 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'. Management will continue to progress on\n\nthese topics and monitor the impact of the audit and corporate governance reforms until final requirements are confirmed. The Aviva Group has also continued to focus on operational risks to the financial plan, including people, cyber, operational resilience and transformation based risks. Further information is in the 'Our risks and risk management' section of the Strategic report.\n\nBy March 2022, Aviva had implemented the initial FCA and PRA policy around operational resilience (PS21/3). The initial activity was refreshed throughout the remainder of 2022, with work being focussed on extending the breadth and depth of mapping of our important business services and developing our approach to stressing our resilience and recovery capabilities against severe but plausible scenarios.\n\n## Board Oversight of Risk Management\n\nThe Board's delegated responsibilities regarding oversight of risk management and the approach to internal controls are set out above. There are good working relationships between the Board committees, and they provide regular reports to the Board on their activities and escalate significant matters where appropriate.\n\nThe responsibilities and activities of each Board Committee are set out in the Committee reports.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How we are governed continued\n\n## Assessment of Effectiveness of Risk Management\n\nEach business unit Chief Executive Officer is required to make a declaration that the Group's governance, and system of internal controls are effective and are fit for purpose for their business and that they are kept under review throughout the year.\n\nAny material risks not previously identified, key control weaknesses or non-compliance with the Group's risk policies or local delegations of authority must be highlighted as part of this process. This is supplemented by investigations carried out at Group level and a Group CEO and CRO declaration for Aviva plc.\n\nThe effectiveness assessment draws on the regular cycle of assurance activity carried out during the year, as well as the results of the annual assessment process. During 2022, this has been supported by the application of the Group's Operational Risk & Control Management (ORCM) framework. The details of key failings or weaknesses are reported to the Risk and Audit Committees and the Board on a regular basis and are summarised annually to enable them to carry out an effectiveness assessment.\n\nThe Risk Committee, working closely with the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board carried out a full review of the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control during the year, covering all key controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls and the RMF.\n\n## The principal committees that oversee risk management\n\n## The Risk Committee\n\n## The Audit Committee\n\nAssists the Board in its oversight of risk and risk management across the Group and makes recommendations on risk appetite to the Board. Reviews the effectiveness of the RMF, and the methodology in determining the Group's capital and liquidity requirements. Ensures that risk management is properly considered in setting remuneration policy.\n\nWorks closely with the Risk Committee and is responsible for assisting the Board in discharging its responsibilities for the integrity of the Group's financial statements, the effectiveness of the system of internal controls and for monitoring the effectiveness, performance and objectivity of the internal and external auditors. The Committee works with the Customer and Sustainability Committee on climaterelated and non-financial disclosures. The Committee also recommends the appointment and remuneration of external auditors.\n\nIn addition, internal audit plays a significant role in contributing to the routine ongoing assessment of the Group's RMF. There has been regular reporting to the Risk Committee throughout the year so that the main outstanding areas of improvement identified in 2021 (relating primarily to risk transformation activity) had been largely remediated by the end of 2022.\n\nThe reports to the Audit and Risk Committees also enabled ongoing oversight of the management of any transitional service arrangement risks associated with the businesses divested during 2021 and 2022.\n\nAreas of continued focus remain the operational risk and control environment risk profile, cyber security and risk management through major change.\n\nSpecific areas for improvement continued to be mitigated in India, which became a majority owned subsidiary in September 2022. The Risk Committee, working in conjunction with the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, will continue to monitor the effectiveness of risk management throughout 2023.\n\nThe RMF of Aviva's international investments, including China and Singapore joint ventures, can differ from the RMF outlined in this report but with a strong focus on local regulatory compliance. We continue to work with these entities so that their residual risk profiles do not unduly increase the Group's overall risk profile compared to Group's risk appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board undertakes a rigorous evaluation process each year to assess how it, its Committees and individual directors are performing. In line with the Code, the Board instructed Lintstock Limited to conduct an externally facilitated evaluation in November and December 2022. Lintstock Limited provides external board evaluation services and has no other connection with Aviva or its directors. The evaluation was conducted through a questionnaire completed by all directors and the results of the evaluation were presented and discussed at the Board in January 2023.\n\nFollowing this discussion, the Board agreed the key areas of focus, and an action plan to address these specific areas as shown in the table above. All actions from the 2021 Board evaluation were addressed during 2022.\n\nThe evaluation also assessed the effectiveness of each of the Board Committees. The current Committee structure was considered effective and the Audit, Nomination and Governance, Risk and Remuneration Committees were all considered to be working effectively. The remit of the Customer and Sustainability Committee has evolved during the course of the year to focus more on customer and sustainability in line with the Group's strategic priorities and will continue to be embedded during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Capital return\n\nDuring 2021, the Board delivered on its strategy to focus the portfolio on the UK, Ireland and Canada where our businesses have market-leading positions and to undertake a programme of divestment for our other businesses. On 2 March 2022, we also delivered on our promise to make a substantial capital return to shareholders and announced a \u00a33.75 billion return of capital to ordinary shareholders via a B Share Scheme. This was in addition to the \u00a31 billion 31 March 2022.

Later in the year, the Board considered and approved the payment of \u00a310 million in unclaimed payments from the B Share Scheme to the Aviva Foundation to support a range of community organisations focused on financial inclusion and community resilience. The Board has ensured that Aviva continues to maintain its financial strength while returning capital and had an estimated Solvency II shareholder cover ratio of 212% at 31 December 2022.\n\nshare buyback which was completed on General Meeting on 9 May 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The objective of the change in remit was to allow more detailed oversight of these two key areas of strategy.\n\nTo further strengthen the linkage between the Board and the boards of our principle operating entities, the Aviva plc Board approved the appointment of two of its members, Jim McConville and Martin Strobel, as Chairs of Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, and Aviva lnsurance Limited, respectively.

Andrea Blance was appointed on 21 February 2022, bringing detailed understanding of customers, risk and regulation to the Board. Mike Craston was appointed as a Non-Executive Director with effect from 17 May 2022. Mike is Chair of the Aviva Investors' Board in the UK and Canada and brings invaluable asset management and corporate leadership experience to the Board.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the succession plan for the Group CEO to ensure that the internal and external talent pipeline was robust and diverse.\n\nOn 13 January 2022, we announced that Jason Windsor had resigned as an Executive Director of Aviva plc, he stepped down from the Board with effect from 9 May 2022.\n\nThe Committee led on the appointment of Charlotte Jones as Chief Financial Officer and Executive Director with effect from 5 September 2022.\n\nMichael Mire reached nine years of tenure on 12 September 2022 and therefore no longer met the independence criteria from that date. The Committee considered the composition of the Board and agreed that it would further support the Board's discussion if Michael remained on the Board as a Non-Executive Director.\n\nPatricia Cross and Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda retired from the Board as Non-Executive Directors at the Company's 2022 AGM.\n\n## Board appointments\n\nOur Non-Executive Directors played a principal role in the process to appoint new directors to the Board. Russell Reynolds, an independent consulting company, undertook the search processes for the appointment of the CFO. MWM Consulting supported the Committee in identifying Andrea Blance as a suitable candidate for the Board. Mike Craston, as noted in the 'Effective Governance', case study on 'Governance in Action' was Chair of the Aviva Investors Board and was appointed, inter alia, to strengthen the linkage between the Board and boards of our principle operating entities . Neither Russell Reynolds nor MWM Consulting have other connections with the Company or any individual Director other than the provision of recruitment services.\n\nIn line with our succession planning processes, we undertake a formal, rigorous and transparent search process for each external appointment, considering the current balance of skills, experience and diversity amongst our directors. Each appointment is made subject to receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals.\n\nFurthermore, the Board is subject to an annual board effectiveness review including confirming that each Director's performance continues to be satisfactory. In accordance with the Code and the Company's Articles of Association, all serving directors must retire and those who wish to continue in office must stand for election or re-election by our shareholders at each AGM. All directors intending to remain in office at the time of the 2022 AGM, were elected or re-elected at that meeting.\n\n## Talent management\n\nThe Committee monitors the development of the Group Executive Committee (ExCo) to ensure that there is an appropriate pipeline of senior executives and potential future Executive Board members with the required skills and experience.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee received updates from the Group CEO on composition and changes to the Group ExCo and considered the development plans and talent profiles of these individuals in line with the Group's succession plans.\n\nThe Committee also considered the development plans designed to prepare successors for ExCo roles. Internal talent development and developing a pipeline of potential future leaders remained an area of focus for the Committee during the year.\n\nThe Committee also considers initiatives to enhance, strengthen and diversify the talent pipeline across the wider Group and members of the Committee remain involved in various initiatives, including the Ethnically Diverse Leadership programme and reverse mentoring programmes with senior leaders.\n\n## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion continued to be an area of focus for the Committee and the Board. The Board is committed to having a diverse and inclusive leadership team which provides a range of perspectives and insights and the challenge needed to support good decision making. Diversity at Aviva includes, but is not limited to, gender, ethnicity, skills and experience, geographic and socio-economic and educational backgrounds, disability and sexual orientation.\n\nThe ways in which we seek to put into practice these values are set out in our Board Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement, which supports the Committee's approach to succession planning. This includes our commitment to increasing the number of women in leadership roles to 40% by 2024 and to enhancing the ethnic diversity of our leadership and succession pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Nomination and Governance Committee report continued\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed the Statement and expanded its remit to include socio-economic and educational backgrounds. The Statement, which aligns to the overall Group Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy, is available on the Company's website at www.aviva.com/ corporate-governance .\n\nAs at the date of this report the representation of women on the Board is 42%. In addition, women represent 42% of the ExCo and further details on gender diversity in the workforce and wider senior leadership population can be found in the Strategic report.\n\nWe actively support women advancing into senior roles, with the Group CEO being a member of the 30% Club and HM Treasury's Women in Finance Champion, which commits financial services companies to a range of measures to improve gender diversity amongst senior management.\n\nThe Board is pleased to have met the Parker Review Committee's target for all FTSE 100 boards to have at least one director from an ethnic minority background.\n\nThe Company also ranks as number 27 on the Stonewall UK Workplace Equality Index.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and independence\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee regularly reviewed the independence of the Board, and conducted a review of individual Director conflict authorisations as recorded in the Conflicts of Interest register. This included any potential conflicts related to\n\nexternal appointments, including Amanda Blanc's appointment to the board of BP plc. In order to form a view of a Director's independence, consideration was also given to other external appointments held by each Director.\n\nFor Non-Executive Directors, independence of thought and judgement is vital to facilitating constructive and challenging debate in the boardroom and is essential to the operational effectiveness of the Board and Committees of Aviva. The Committee determines a Non-Executive Director's independence in line with Provision 10 of the Code and was satisfied that all Independent Non-Executive Directors met the criteria for independence and that the Chair of the Board met the criteria on appointment to that role. Mike Craston was not considered an independent Non-Executive Director upon appointment due to his previous role at Aviva Investors. Michael Mire reached nine years of tenure on 12 September 2022 and therefore no longer met the independence criteria from that date. As a result he stood down from the Risk and Remuneration Committees on 12 September 2022.\n\n## Organisational design\n\nThe Committee considers proposals for operating model simplification within the Group. The reduced geographic size of the Group provided an opportunity to optimise and simplify our operating model to drive efficiency and deliver greater value to our shareholders. The Committee reviewed the organisational design plans and the programme workstreams and considered the governance and controls around the proposed changes.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nThe Committee monitors the Group's compliance with the Code and other areas of regulation and guidance. The Group Company Secretary provides updates to the Committee on governance matters, and legal and litigation risks which have the potential to impact the reputation of the Group.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee focused on the implementation and embedding of the Group Governance Framework for the oversight of the Group's subsidiaries, as reported in the Subsidiary Governance dashboard. Updates were provided relating to enhancements to the Subsidiary Governance Principles, the effectiveness of the Company's subsidiary boards and the Group Conflicts of Interest policy, and related safeguards.\n\nThe Committee considers succession planning for material subsidiaries around the Group and, where appropriate, approves changes to the composition of the material subsidiary boards. The Committee also reviews the outcomes of the board evaluations completed by subsidiaries and monitors the action plans developed by those boards in response to those outcomes.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe Committee undertakes a review of its effectiveness annually as part of the Board Evaluation. More information can be found in the 'Governance in action' section of the Governance report.\n\n## George Culmer\n\nChair of the Nomination and Governance Committee 8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee also provides assurance over the integrity of the Group's financial and non-financial reporting (NFR) including climate-related disclosures. Together with the Risk Committee, it monitors the effectiveness of the internal control environment over financial and non-financial reporting.\n\nThe Committee monitors the effectiveness, performance, objectivity and independence of our internal and external auditors. The Committee also monitors our whistleblowing arrangements.\n\n## Key committee activities during 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and recommended for approval the quarterly reporting, halfyear and full year financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed developments in climaterelated and non-financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and approved IFRS 17 accounting policies and monitored the development and implementation of systems and processes to support IFRS 17 reporting.\n- \u00b7 Assessed the effectiveness of the work of the external auditors and the internal audit function including the outcomes of associated external reviews.\n- \u00b7 Monitored the effectiveness of the systems of internal control over financial and non-financial reporting that support the integrity of Aviva's financial and non-financial disclosures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Audit Committee report continued\n\n## Committee member requirements\n\nIn my role as Committee Chair I annually review how members meet the experience and expertise criteria set out in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FCA Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTRs). I, as Committee Chair, Andrea Blance, Shonaid Jemmett-Page and Jim McConville fulfilled both this Code and the DTR requirements for financial expertise and experience. The Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the insurance and broader financial services industry.\n\n## External and internal audit effectiveness\n\nThe Committee regularly receives reports from the external auditor on the progress of its audit activities. The Committee reviews the contents of these reports and the level of professional scepticism and challenge of management assumptions demonstrated by the external auditor, and where appropriate, requests that management respond to that challenge and tracks management response to ensure a satisfactory outcome to the challenges raised.\n\nThe 2022 External Audit Effectiveness review was undertaken to assist the Committee in assessing the quality of audit services provided to the Group through completion of a questionnaire by the Committee, subsidiary company audit committees, senior management, and members of the Group's finance teams. The review focused on the effectiveness of the audit team, expertise and resources and interaction with\n\naudit committee meetings. Overall feedback was positive and where opportunities for improvement were identified, PwC was asked to take account of that feedback in the planning for future audit activity. The Committee was provided with the FRC Audit Quality Review (AQR) report on the PwC audit of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts and discussed the findings with PwC. No specific actions were required as a result of the AQR. The AQR provided further external evidence to the Committee of the robustness and quality of the external audit.\n\nThe Committee concluded that the external auditor continued to perform effectively and is recommended to shareholders for reappointment at the 2023 AGM. PwC have been Aviva's external auditor since 2012, and subject to continued satisfactory performance, it is anticipated that PwC will continue in its role until completion of the Full Year 2023 audit, when in line with the outcomes of last year's competitive tender process, EY will be appointed as the external auditor. The Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Committee also conducts an annual review of the internal audit function to assess its independence, effectiveness and to satisfy itself that the quality, experience and expertise of the internal audit function is appropriate for the business. This is carried out by reviewing reports issued by internal audit and the output of an\n\nannual stakeholder effectiveness survey. This formal process is supplemented by regular private discussions with executive management, the internal auditor and the external auditor. During the year, an External Quality Assessment (EQA) of the internal audit function was completed by Deloitte. The outcome of the EQA was built into an action plan to further enhance the effectiveness of the internal audit function. The Committee concluded that for 2022 the function performed well and remained effective.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe Committee undertakes a review of its effectiveness annually as part of the Board Evaluation. More information can be found in the 'Governance in action' section of the Governance report.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nThe Committee Chair is the whistleblowers' champion for the Group and is responsible for overseeing the integrity, independence and effectiveness of the Group's policies in relation to whistleblowing. The Committee receives reports on the number of cases reported to the Speak Up Service, the proportion of reports that are designated as instances of whistleblowing, the number of substantiated cases and summaries of the action taken.\n\nThe Committee continues to support the Speak Up team and review opportunities to further enhance the Speak Up Service. The outcome of the Voice of Aviva survey is used to assess staff comfort and confidence in the whistleblowing processes.\n\n## 2023 Priorities\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor the programme to implement IFRS 17, including the design of reporting systems and calculation of new measures. The Committee will also seek assurance over the design and implementation of the system of controls over financial reporting relating to disclosures under IFRS 17. Working in conjunction with the Customer and Sustainability Committee there will be further enhancement to our climate and non-financial reporting and assurance processes.\n\nThe Committee also continues to monitor the latest Government proposals for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation on audit and corporate governance reform. Proposals, including the development of an Audit and Assurance Policy (AAP), are being closely monitored. While new regulation is not expected during 2023, the Committee is overseeing development of an AAP and changes in external disclosures in readiness for the new regulations when they do take effect.\n\nThe Committee will also provide oversight of the work to transition the role of the external auditor from PwC to EY, who, subject to approval at the 2024 AGM, will be appointed for the financial year ended 31 December 2024.\n\n## Patrick Flynn\n\nChair of the Audit Committee 8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Committee reviews the underlying  assumptions as these involve complex  judgements and changes can have a  significant impact on reported results. | Technical provisions .  The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions used in the calculation of the Best Estimate  Liability component of the technical provisions required under SII, and the expense impacts on SII reserves across our life and  general insurance businesses. The Committee reviewed and challenged the longevity, persistency, expense and residential and commercial property growth  assumptions used for the quarterly operating updates, and 2022 half year and full year financial statements. The process around  the setting of longevity assumptions was a particularly significant area for review as those judgements could have a material  impact on Aviva's SII and IFRS results. During 2022, the Committee worked closely with the Audit Committee of the Group's UK  Life subsidiary, Aviva Life & Pensions UK Ltd, to review the detailed analysis and to validate changes observed in recent mortality  experience and the resulting impact on the existing longevity assumptions. The Committee reviewed the impact of the period of  higher inflation and the rising interest rate environment during 2022. This included residential property assumptions, the impact  on the general insurance business of current and future claims inflation, and impacts on the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme. COVID-19 assumptions on business interruption.  The Committee reviewed the judgements made in relation to COVID-19 |\n| IFRS and SII key accounting  judgements and disclosures | The Committee reviews and  recommends to the Board Quarterly,  Half Year and Full Year disclosures and  the impact of accounting judgements  on those disclosures.

The Committee reviewed, challenged and recommended  approval of IFRS and SII judgements, including the impact of acquisitions on the Group balance sheet and the outcome of  goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews. The Committee reviewed the Group's exposure to contingent liabilities and  other risk factors, including amounts allowed for and disclosures. The Committee also considered the financial impact and  disclosures stemming from the war in Ukraine.  Where appropriate, the Committee monitored and tracked management's  response to the challenges it raised to ensure a satisfactory outcome. Alternative Performance Measures (APMs). The Committee reviewed and approved the clarification and treatment of certain  items within the Group's Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) to further improve the transparency and consistency of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

IFRS 17  is expected to have a significant impact  on reporting of the Group's financial  performance. | The Committee continued to monitor preparedness for the implementation of new IFRS standards, but most significantly in respect  of IFRS 17. IFRS 17 will have a significant impact on the measurement and presentation of insurance contracts and the Committee  has spent significant time considering the new accounting policies and judgements. The Committee continued to regularly assess  the impact on the financial reporting process, the operation of new internal financial tools to be used for financial forecasting and  planning purposes, and the calculation of insurance liabilities under the new standard. The Committee monitored updates on the  planning and implementation activities for IFRS 17, and reviewed and approved tranches of accounting methodologies during 2022  in support of a series of 'dry runs' ahead of the effective date of 1 January 2023. The Committee initially commenced the review and  agreement of IFRS 17 accounting policies and judgements during 2021. This continued into 2022 as the Committee reviewed,  challenged and approved the material accounting judgements required to implement IFRS 17. The Committee also assessed the  effectiveness of the systems of controls over the new IFRS 17 reporting systems. |\n| Non-financial and  Sustainability Reporting | The Committee provides oversight of  the integrity of climate-related and  non-financial reporting.                                                                                                                                                   | The Committee reviewed and challenged the application of critical climate-related and non-financial metrics related policies,  practices, methods and judgements to calculate the metrics. This included the monitoring of the systems of controls over these  disclosures. The Committee reviewed the findings of the assurance with the external auditor and shared with the Customer and  Sustainability Committee the outcome of the review, and how it contributed to the integrity of climate and non-financial metrics  reporting in the Annual Report and Sustainability Report. The Committee, working with the Customer and Sustainability  Committee, recommended the climate-related disclosures to the Board for approval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Internal Controls                           | The Committee provides oversight of  the system of internal control over  financial reporting.                                                                                                                                                        | Review of the effectiveness of the Operational Risk and Control Management (ORCM) system.

        "page_content": "## Customer and Sustainability Committee report continued\n\n## Transition to the Customer and Sustainability Committee during 2022\n\nDuring the year, the Committee transitioned from the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee to the Customer and Sustainability Committee. Conduct matters were transferred to the remit of the Risk Committee and reputational matters to the Board. This has enabled the Committee to focus more closely on customer and sustainability matters across all of Aviva's businesses, routinely from the UK Life Insurance and UK General Insurance businesses and by way of deep dives from the Canadian and Irish businesses.\n\n## Customer\n\nThe Committee provided oversight of our customer strategy and operations. This included regular reviews of the customer dashboard, which provided the Committee with an overview of key customer metrics, data and insights. The Committee reviewed our Customer and Marketing transformation plan, which is designed to help Aviva meet more of our customers' needs. It also monitored the progress of customer journeys which could be undertaken digitally and the improvements in customer experience.\n\nThe Committee reviewed and supported our new brand campaign, \"Making it Click\" which recognises that taking financial action can be difficult for customers and was aimed at helping customers make decisions in relation to their finances.\n\nIn a joint meeting with the Risk Committee, the Committee undertook a deep dive on Aviva's data strategy and reviewed our data capabilities, as well as our plans to enhance customer experience, including for our more vulnerable customers.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe Committee tracked progress against Aviva's Sustainability Ambition, including programme governance, Key Performance Indicators and the Sustainability Ambition scorecard. The Committee reviewed and agreed the non-financial metrics, which demonstrate Aviva's ESG performance and monitored progress against the metrics. The Committee also provided input into the governance model for external reporting.\n\nThe Committee provided oversight of the Aviva Climate Transition Plan which supports Aviva's ambition to become a Net Zero carbon company by 2040. The Committee reviewed the content of the TCFD disclosures in preparation for the climate disclosures being voted on (on an advisory basis) at the Annual General Meeting. The Committee also reviewed the Aviva Sustainability Report and recommended this to the Board.\n\nThe Committee continued to monitor and support our community investment and received updates on the partnership with Citizens Advice and the Money Advice Trust.\n\nThe Committee received updates on the actions we are taking to help our customers and communities through the cost of living challenge.\n\nFurther information on our integrated responsibility and sustainable business approach can be found on the Company's website at: www.aviva.com/sustainability\n\n.\n\n## Aviva Canada and Ireland\n\nDuring the year, Aviva Canada and Aviva Ireland presented to the Committee an update on their customer strategies including customer journeys and experience and on the sustainability scorecards for their markets. The presentations provided the Committee with information on how Aviva Canada and Ireland contributed to the overall group performance.\n\n## Conduct and compliance\n\nWhilst as the Customer, Conduct and Reputation Committee, the Committee reviewed Aviva's conduct risk agenda, conduct risk profile, compliance obligations and the wider regulatory landscape. The Committee received regular updates on the implementation of the FCA's Pricing Practices regulation which came into effect on 1 January 2022.\n\nThe Committee also conducted a deep dive into the FCA's new Consumer Duty proposals, following the FCA's second consultation paper published in December 2021 and reviewed Aviva's response to the consultation in February.\n\nThe Committee continued to receive regular updates on the Consumer Duty regulation throughout the year and assessed the impact the Duty would have on our customers.\n\n## Reputation\n\nPrior to the transition of the Committee, the Committee monitored developments in the Group's reputation and reputational risk position. Key areas of focus included feedback on Aviva's reputation amongst different stakeholder groups, as well as the impact of business interruption litigation on Aviva and the cost of living challenges faced by Aviva customers.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe Committee undertakes a review of its effectiveness annually as part of the Board Evaluation. More information can be found in the 'Governance in action' section of the Governance report.\n\nShonaid Jemmett-Page Chair of the Customer and Sustainability Committee 8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Risk Committee report continued\n\n## Oversight of risk management\n\nThe main purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of risk within the Group, with a focus on reviewing the Group's risk appetite and risk profile in relation to solvency, liquidity, climate, operational, conduct and reputational risks and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management framework (RMF) making recommendations to the Board as required.\n\nThe Committee reviews the methodology and internal model used in determining the Group's capital requirements and associated stress testing, and the due diligence appraisals carried out on strategic or significant transactions.\n\nIn addition to the risks inherent in the Group's investment portfolio, the Committee reviews the Group's operational risks, including significant changes to the regulatory framework.\n\nDuring the year the Committee reviewed management actions in response to the Group's increased exposure to general insurance property catastrophic risk as a result of hardening reinsurance markets.\n\nThe Committee works with the Remuneration Committee so that risk management and risk culture are properly considered in setting the Remuneration Policy and determining remuneration outcomes.\n\nDuring the year, the oversight of conduct risk was transferred to the Risk Committee as part of the transition of the Customer, Conduct, and Reputation Committee to the\n\nCustomer and Sustainability Committee. The Committee will continue to focus on conduct risk into 2023, particularly as the requirements of the new Consumer Duty Regulations are embedded.\n\nThe Committee also continued to work closely throughout the year with the Audit Committee on risk and control matters.\n\nThere has been good engagement with the chairs of the subsidiary risk committees in 2022, covering thematic risks across the Group as well as business unit specific focus areas.\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nDuring the year the Committee considered one of the biggest threats to the Group's capital and liquidity position to be macroeconomic risks and received regular updates on interest, inflation, capital and liquidity. Continuing areas of uncertainty include the war in Ukraine, credit spreads and downgrades, inflation, interest rate movements and the risk of commercial property price volatility on the commercial mortgage portfolio.\n\nThe Committee considered actions being taken to support customer wellbeing, and oversaw and supported the proactive steps undertaken by the business in relation to specific customer threats, which included customer focused education and awareness in response to the cost of living crisis, and the related increase in cyber based investment scams targeting customers.\n\nEmployee wellbeing has remained high on the agenda and the Committee discussed the actions being taken to manage people\n\nrisk, including resource stretch, and the cost of living crisis.\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe Committee received regular updates on the risk profile, residual risks, key concerns and outlook across all markets and risk appetites. Whilst the insights gained from the dashboard demonstrated continued improvement in the management of risk and controls across the Group, they also enabled the Committee to request deep dives in certain areas including the management of capital and liquidity risk, cyber and energy security risk, as well as the risk culture throughout the Group.\n\nThe Committee also received regular updates and challenged the progress made by management on operational resilience and change management related risk appetite and tolerances in particular.\n\n## Climate change\n\nAs detailed in its Committee Report, the Customer and Sustainability Committee oversaw the progress made in 2022 against the goals contained with Aviva's Sustainability Ambition. However, overseeing the management of climate-related risk is a key pillar of the risk management framework, and was accordingly managed in close collaboration between the Committee, the Customer and Sustainability Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nDuring the year the Committee considered a deep dive on governance and monitoring across asset classes and the role of Aviva's Sustainability Ambition in managing climate-related risk appetite.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThe Committee undertakes a review of its effectiveness annually as part of the Board Evaluation. More information can be found in the 'Governance in action' section of the Governance report.\n\n## 2023 priorities\n\nContinue to support the search and appointment process for the Group CRO.\n\nMonitor the impacts and associated risks arising from the macroeconomic environment, regulatory landscape, and global climate change, with a particular focus on consideration of emerging risks. Focus on the management of capital and liquidity risks.\n\nOversight of the current and future conduct risk exposures of the Group, including determination of risk appetite and tolerance and desired risk intelligent culture, particularly as the new Consumer Duty Regulations are implemented during 2023.\n\nBuild a strong dialogue between the Committee and our equivalent subsidiary level risk committees, and embed the changes introduced by the repurposing of the Customer and Sustainability Committee.\n\n## Andrea Blance\n\nChair of the Risk Committee 8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee report continued\n\n## Growth in the value created in our businesses\n\nPerformance against the financial measures in relation to our incentive plans exceeded targets:\n\n- \u00b7 Growth in the value created by our businesses was demonstrated in the increase in Solvency II own funds generation (Solvency II OFG) and cash remittances, both exceeding target levels.\n- \u00b7 Cost reductions achieved in 2022 were in line with our targets, reflecting continued efficiency improvements.\n- \u00b7 Growth and expense discipline saw increased group adjusted operating profit, in excess of target level.\n\nIn terms of non-financial performance, the Committee welcomed the continued improvement evident in our risk and control environment, as reflected in an above target assessment against the qualitative and quantitative measures within the Risk scorecard. Our employee engagement levels saw a 14 point increase to 86%, a figure well ahead of market norms. This reflects the focus on leadership development and visibility, and actions to support our people through a difficult economic environment.\n\nPerformance against our customer measures was more challenging, given the impact of inflation on product pricing, supply chain issues, and market volatility on pension valuations.\n\n## Supporting our people\n\nOversight of remuneration across the wider colleague population featured prominently on the Committee's agenda during 2022. Aviva is proud to pay all of our UK colleagues at least the Real Living Wage, plus an additional 8% to enable colleagues to benefit from our 14% matching pension contribution and save for their retirement.\n\nDuring 2022, we closely monitored the impact of the rising cost of living on our colleagues and welcomed the actions that were taken to support them, which included:\n\n- \u00b7 Over 9,000 colleagues received a one-off cost of living payment of up to \u00a31,000.\n- \u00b7 All colleagues received \u00a31,000 of free shares to recognise their contribution to the reshaping of our business and the capital return to shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Car parking charges have been removed at UK sites where Aviva is the facility operator.\n- \u00b7 An extension to our wellbeing programmes to include financial education.\n- \u00b7 21,000 free lunches were provided to children of UK colleagues during school holidays.\n\nFor 2023, the UK salary budget was 7%. Recognising the current cost of living challenges, a higher budget was targeted at more junior colleagues offset by a significantly lower budget for senior management.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for 2022\n\nOur remuneration outcomes reflect the strong performance of Aviva in 2022, as set out below.\n\n## 2022 annual bonus\n\nThe formulaic outcome from the annual bonus scorecard was 79.7% of maximum (at 159.3%).\n\nThe Committee carefully considered this outcome in the context of broader performance and a quality of earnings assessment, noting input from the Audit and Risk Committees, to ensure the scorecard outcome was reflective of overall performance and aligned with the experience of shareholders. The Committee determined that no adjustments were required to the formulaic bonus scorecard outcome.\n\nIn line with the Policy the Committee also considered the individual performance of the Group CEO and Group CFO to determine whether individual adjustments to the scorecard outcome were required.\n\nAmanda Blanc's performance as Group CEO continues to be exceptional. Aviva's share price has performed strongly against both our sector and the broader FTSE 100, reflecting strong execution of the clear strategy which Amanda has set out.\n\nFrom an external perspective, Amanda has continued to enhance Aviva's profile across multiple industry and public forums and has been recognised as an influential business and financial services leader. This performance is reflected in Amanda's annual bonus for 2022 of 97.2% of maximum (at 194.3% of salary).\n\nSince joining Aviva as Group CFO in September 2022, Charlotte Jones has made an impressive start, quickly building relationships and credibility with stakeholders. Charlotte has provided effective leadership through a period of external volatility while developing an ambitious business plan for the Group and creating a long-term vision and strategy for the Finance function. Charlotte's annual bonus for 2022 was 86.4% of maximum (at 129.7% of salary).\n\n## 2020-22 LTIP\n\nThe formulaic vesting outcome was 80.2%, reflecting strong performance against the Solvency II return on equity (Solvency II RoE) and relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) targets. Consistent with our commitments, the Committee carefully reviewed whether this vesting outcome was appropriate, being mindful of the guidance from proxy agencies and investors around the issue of 'windfall gains'. This assessment, detailed within the report, resulted in a 10% downward adjustment in the vesting outcome.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On appointment, Charlotte's remuneration package was in line with that of her predecessor. I have been particularly impressed with how quickly Charlotte has built relationships with our stakeholders. Further details can be found within the DRR.\n\n## Shareholder consultation\n\nThe Chair and Executive Directors (EDs) meet with institutional shareholders during the year. Topics raised during 2022 included Aviva's dividend policy, capital returns, climate risk and progress against our strategic plan. A shareholder newsletter is published quarterly on aviva.com.\n\nI look forward to continued constructive engagement with shareholders this year as we prepare a revised Policy for approval at the 2024 AGM.\n\n## Remuneration in 2023 Salary\n\nAmanda will receive a salary increase of 4.85%. Charlotte will receive a salary increase of 4.81%.\n\nThe percentage increases for our Executive Directors are significantly below the overall increase in the UK salary budget of 7%.\n\n## 2023 annual bonus and 2023-25 LTIP\n\nFor Amanda and Charlotte, the opportunities are unchanged from the awards made for the prior year.

I look forward to engaging with shareholders as part of the review ahead of the 2024 AGM vote.\n\nFinally, the Committee took a number of actions to support colleagues through cost of living challenges during 2022. In 2023, we will continue to closely monitor the ongoing impacts to colleagues.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAviva has again delivered very strong results in a challenging and volatile economic environment, demonstrating the benefits of our diversified business. As a Committee, we have sought to make decisions which effectively drive and reward results, while continuing to align with UK best practice remuneration and governance expectations. I hope that this report is clear and informative and I look forward to seeing shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Pippa Lambert\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 8 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee's view is that the Remuneration Framework at Aviva is well-aligned with these areas.\n\n## Clarity\n\n- \u00b7 Our remuneration framework is structured to support the financial and strategic objectives of the Group, aligning the interests of our EDs with those of shareholders and wider stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 We are committed to transparent communication with all our stakeholders, including shareholders further details of our engagement process for the Policy are set out under the 'Views' section on the next page.\n\n## Risk\n\nOur reward structure ensures risk events are reflected in remuneration outcomes through:\n\n- \u00b7 Opinion from Risk on appropriate performance measures and targets; risk, performance management and consequence management inputs are considered before awards are made.\n- \u00b7 Overarching discretion is retained to adjust formulaic outcomes to properly reflect any risk events.\n- \u00b7 Deferral of annual bonus (over three years) and LTIP (five years, including an additional twoyear holding period for EDs), subject to malus and clawback provisions which mitigates against future risk.\n- \u00b7 Our within- and postemployment shareholding guidelines align to the successful delivery of the Group's long-term strategy.\n\n## Simplicity\n\n- \u00b7 We operate a simple remuneration framework, comprising fixed pay elements, along with short-and long-term variable elements.\n- \u00b7 This structure provides clear line of sight for both executives and shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The annual bonus and LTIP are focused on our strategic priorities, rewarding performance against key measures of success for the business.\n\n## Proportionality\n\n- \u00b7 There is clear alignment between the performance of the Group and the rewards available to EDs.\n- \u00b7 Incentive elements are closely aligned to our strategic goals, transparent and robustly assessed, with the Committee having full discretion to adjust outcomes to ensure they align with overall Aviva performance.\n\n## Predictability\n\n- \u00b7 The Policy sets out the possible future value of remuneration which EDs could receive, including the impact of share price appreciation of 50% see the illustration of the Policy for further details.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- \u00b7 We are committed to effective stakeholder and colleague engagement.\n- \u00b7 As part of this, the Committee regularly reviews data and insights relating to pay and broader employment conditions in the workforce, and takes these into account when considering executive remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We will consult with shareholders during 2023 in preparation for presenting our Policy to shareholders at the 2024 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Our colleagues\n\nThe Committee has sight of colleague views through the colleague engagement survey (Voice of Aviva), input from the People function during Committee meetings, colleague forums and the Evolution Council, chaired by the Board Chair. Specifically for the last two channels:\n\n- \u00b7 The Committee Chair met with Your Forum (a fully elected employee forum representing UK colleagues) as well as members of Unite the Union in June 2022. Discussion included matters of interest to colleagues and members covering areas such as colleagues' return to the office and hybrid working; recruitment and retention; the Group's ongoing response to the cost of living challenges as well as our ESG goals and strategy for the future.\n- \u00b7 The Evolution Council consists of a diverse group of high calibre leaders from across the business who discuss a range of topics related to the Group's strategy, values, culture and performance.\n\nWhen determining the Policy and arrangements for EDs, the Committee also reviews:\n\n- \u00b7 Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group to ensure reward structures are suitably aligned and that levels of remuneration remain appropriate, as set out below table 12. Other considerations include:\n- - Changes in remuneration (salary, benefits and bonus) of UK employees compared with that of directors (see table 8).\n- - The ratio of CEO pay to that of employees (see tables 11 and 12).\n- - Gender and ethnicity pay gaps. We released our UK Pay Gap Report 2022 in February 2023. This was the sixth year that we published our gender pay gap and the second time we published our ethnicity pay gap. The report also included details of actions we are taking to drive change and close the gap. The report can be found at www.aviva.com/ about-us/uk-pay-gap-report .\n- - Any material changes to benefit and pension provision for colleagues more widely.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Risk Scorecard objectively assesses and reports on how effectively first line Aviva employees and senior management manage risk and controls. The Risk Scorecard considered risk behaviours, outcomes and a second line check and challenge. The Group outturn rating reflects ongoing progress with strengthening the Risk and Control environment and desired Risk Culture throughout Aviva.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee also assessed Charlotte on her individual performance from the period of joining Aviva in September 2022 to the end of the year. This assessment is set out to the right.\n\n## Amanda Blanc\n\nAmanda's strong leadership continues to have a significant impact on the performance and transformation of the Aviva Group. Key achievements include:\n\n- \u00b7 Delivery of a robust set of financial results, meeting or exceeding targets for: Cash remittances, Solvency II OFG, Group adjusted operating profit and cost savings.\n- \u00b7 Completion of the \u00a34.75 billion capital return, with an additional capital return scheduled for the 2022 results announcement.\n- \u00b7 Completion of strategic  bolt-on acquisitions, namely Succession Wealth and Azur.\n- \u00b7 Playing a significant role in lobbying for Solvency II reforms, which would enable Aviva to invest in a wider range of asset classes, most notably, Infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Disciplined and active management of pricing and underwriting to mitigate inflationary pressures.\n- \u00b7 Employee engagement 5% above Financial Services (FS) norms 1 , employees feeling safe to speak up 10% above FS norms, and trust in senior leadership has increased 14% year on year.\n- \u00b7 Continued strengthening of the senior leadership team through the appointment of Charlotte Jones as Group CFO.\n- \u00b7 Enhancement of customer digital journeys with 200+ changes made this year.\n- \u00b7 Significant progress towards Aviva's ambition to be Net Zero by 2040 and continuing to shape the future financial architecture for climate change through work with GFANZ and attendance at COP15.\n- \u00b7 Enhancing Aviva's brand through her media activity. Amanda was named as The Sunday Times Business Person of the Year and Insurance Personality of the Year at the British Insurance Awards. She was also included in The Financial Times' 25 most influential women of 2022 and Forbes - The World's 100 Most Powerful Women in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Amanda is the Women in Finance Charter Champion and helped to issue a blueprint of best practice to help all organisations in progressing the female agenda.\n\n## Charlotte Jones\n\nKey achievements include:\n\n- \u00b7 Building relationships and credibility with colleagues, analysts, shareholders and regulators.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the financial strength of the Group, with strong capital and liquidity positions, despite market volatility and political uncertainty.\n- \u00b7 Partnering with the Group CEO on delivering key updates to the market, including an update on IFRS 17 implementation.\n- \u00b7 Leading on the development of a stretching and ambitious three-year business plan, which is aligned to the Group's strategic priorities and commitments to investors.\n- \u00b7 Creating a long-term vision and strategy for Finance and reshaping the function to deliver transformative commercial partnering to the business.\n\nThe Committee considered that in light of Amanda's outstanding performance during the year, it was appropriate to apply an individual adjustment of 35% to her bonus outcome. As Charlotte was newly appointed, the Committee did not make any adjustment to her bonus outcome.\n\nTable 3 2022 bonus outcomes for Executive Directors (audited information) 2\n\n|                                               | Amanda Blanc   | Charlotte Jones   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Bonus scorecard (0% - 200%)                   | 159.3%         | 159.3%            |\n| Committee discretion                          | -%             | -%                |\n| Sub total                                     | 159.3%         | 159.3%            |\n| Individual adjustment                         | 35.0%          | -%                |\n| Final outcome                                 | 194.3%         | 159.3%            |\n| Target opportunity (% of salary)              | 100.0%         | 100.0%            |\n| Maximum opportunity for 2022 2  (% of salary) | 200.0%         | 150.0%            |\n| Final bonus outcomes                          |                |                   |\n| % of salary 3                                 | 194.3%         | 129.7%            |\n| % of maximum                                  | 97.2%          | 86.4%             |\n| \u00a3 amount                                      | \u00a32,001,290     | \u00a3282,921          |\n\n- 1.

The Group CEO has a maximum bonus opportunity, inclusive of any individual adjustment, of two times target (i.e. 200% of salary) while the Group CFO has a maximum opportunity, inclusive of any individual adjustment, of one and a half times target (150% of salary)\n- 3. The bonus scorecard for EDs can range from 0 to 200 %. When the final outcome is above 100%, the resulting final bonus outcome, as a percentage of salary, is on a '1% for 1%' basis for the Group CEO and on a '2% for 1%' basis for other EDs; e.g. a final outcome of 140% would result in a bonus of 140% of salary for the Group CEO and 120% of salary for other EDs. When below 100%, scaling is '1% for 1%', such that a final outcome of 80% would result in a bonus of 80 % of salary for all EDs, including the Group CEO.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration continued\n\n## Discretion\n\nThe Committee is conscious of the provisions of the 2018 Code, with remuneration committees being encouraged to review incentive outcomes against individual and company performance, together with any wider circumstances, and to exercise independent judgement and discretion in relation to remuneration outcomes. Taking into account the impact of the outcome of the quality of earnings assessment (see opposite), the Committee is of the view that these outcomes appropriately reflect the overall performance of Aviva during the year and align with the experience of shareholders and no discretion was exercised.\n\n## 2020 LTIP vesting in respect of performance period 2020-2022 (audited information)\n\nThe Solvency II RoE and TSR outcomes for the 2020 LTIP are detailed in the table below.\n\nTable 4  2020 LTIP award - performance conditions\n\n| Measure               |                    | Threshold (20 % vest) 1   | Maximum  (100 % of vest)   | Vesting (% of  maximum)   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Solvency II RoE - 50% |                    | 10.5%                     | 12.5%                      |                           |\n|                       | Aviva  performance |                           | 13.2%                      | 100%                      |\n| Relative TSR 2  - 50% | Aviva              | Median                    | Upper quintile  and above  | 60%                       |\n\n- 1. Threshold vesting is 20% for each performance measure independently\n- 2. For the purposes of measuring the TSR performance condition, the Company's TSR and that of the comparator group will be based on the 90-day average TSR for the period immediately preceding the start and end of the performance period. The comparator group is provided in footnote 4 to table 16.\n\nAmanda was granted 641,921 conditional shares under the LTIP on 6 August 2020 for the threeyear performance period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. An additional 104,637 shares have accrued as dividend equivalents. Amanda was appointed as Group CEO on 6 July 2020 and her 2020 LTIP award was pro-rated to represent period of time worked in 2020.\n\nOn a formulaic basis, the 2020 LTIP award vested at 80.2% of maximum. This reflected strong performance against the financial Solvency II RoE target, with favourable economic movements over the period not affecting the vesting outcome, and above median relative TSR performance. Consistent with our commitments in the 2020 DRR, the Committee carefully reviewed whether this vesting outcome was appropriate, being mindful of the guidance from proxy agencies and investors around the issue of 'windfall gains'. In doing so, the Committee recognised three key factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Firstly, there was a fall in the share price in the period prior to grant. The extent to which this fall was driven by COVID-19 is ultimately a subjective judgement, but the overall magnitude was not wholly out of line with that seen in the wider market or sectoral peers.\n- \u00b7 Secondly, Aviva's performance over the last three years, and particularly in the period since Amanda Blanc's appointment in July 2020, has been outstanding. From a total shareholder return perspective, we outperformed our sector 1 median by c.14 percentage points and the broader FTSE 100 by c.13 percentage points. The strategy which Amanda announced with our Half Year 2020 results has delivered strong financial performance we have seen robust growth across targeted areas, while continued progress on our cost base has driven greater efficiencies throughout the business. We also sold businesses in continental Europe (France, Poland and Italy) and Asia (Singapore and Vietnam). This strong performance allowed us to return \u00a34.75 billion to shareholders, and we have announced a new share buyback scheme beginning in March 2023.\n- \u00b7 Thirdly, in determining the LTIP award made to Amanda on joining Aviva, the Committee at that time decided on an extremely conservative approach, resulting in an award of 147% of salary. This represented 49% of a full award despite Amanda being in role for 83% of the performance period.\n\nTaking all of the above into consideration, the Committee concluded that a downwards adjustment of 10% was appropriate. This reflects the Committee view that there had been an impact from COVID-19 on the share price at the time of grant, but also recognises both the outstanding performance delivered over the last three years and the significant reduction which had already been applied to Amanda's award. The Committee considered that this adjustment provided a reasonable final vesting outcome, aligned with Aviva's performance and circumstances over the period.\n\n- 1. Based on the median of Aviva's 2020 LTIP comparator group, which can be found in footnote 4 to table 16.\n\n## Quality of earnings assessment - 2022 remuneration decisions\n\nThe Committee discussed those items that impacted the overall results in 2022 e.g. foreign exchange, acquisitions and disposals, life assumption and modelling changes, prior year reserve development, and other items that are non-recurring in nature. This process provides the Committee with an understanding of the core profitability of the business taking these factors into account.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nAs part of the annual pay review process, the Committee has considered whether any recovery or withholding under the malus and clawback provisions of Aviva's incentive plans is required by any current circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The LTIP is a conditional right to receive shares, which vest at the end of a three-year performance period, with an additional two-year holding period. ABP represents two-thirds of the 2021 bonus, which is deferred into shares and vests in three equal annual tranches. Shares issued in lieu of dividends accrue on ABP and LTIP awards during the ABP deferral period and the LTIP performance period.\n- 2. Face values for the awards granted on 21 March 2022 and 5 September 2022 have been calculated using the average of the middle-market closing price of an Aviva ordinary share on the three consecutive business days immediately preceding the date of the main grant for employees, 21 March 2022, of 424 pence\n- 3. Threshold vesting is 20% for each performance measure independently. This means less than 20% may vest overall.\n\n## Targets for LTIP awards made in 2022\n\nThree-year targets are set annually within the context of the Company's strategic plan. The 2022 targets are provided below.\n\n|                                                                               |           | Below  threshold   | Threshold   |          | Maximum        | Above  maximum   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------|\n| Measure                                                                       | Weighting | 0%                 | 20%         | 20-100 % | 100 %          | 100 %            |\n| Solvency II RoE 1                                                             | 15%       |                    | 11%         |          | 13%            |                  |\n| Cumulative cash  remittances 1                                                | 25%       |                    | \u00a35.3bn      |          | \u00a35.8bn         |                  |\n| Relative TSR 2                                                                | 40%       |                    | Median      |          | Upper quintile |                  |\n| Reduction in CO 2 intensity of  shareholders' assets  and with-profit funds 3 | 7.5%      |                    | 25%         |          | 27.5%          |                  |\n| RNPS gap to  competition 4                                                    | 7.5%      |                    | 11.0        |          | 14.0           |                  |\n| Females in senior  leadership roles 5                                         | 2.5%      |                    | 37.0%       |          | 40.0%          |                  |\n| Ethnically diverse  employees in senior  leadership roles 6                   | 2.5%      |                    | 10.0%       |          | 13.0%          |                  |\n\n- 1. Any vesting of the Solvency II RoE and Cumulative cash remittances elements of the LTIP are subject to a Solvency II shareholder cover ratio that meets or exceeds the minimum of the stated working range (in 2022, this was 160%)\n- 2. Aviva's TSR performance will be assessed against that of the following companies: Admiral, Allianz, AXA, Direct Line Group, Hargreaves Lansdown, Hiscox, Intact, Legal & General, Lloyds Banking Group, M&G, Phoenix, Quilter and Zurich Insurance Group. The performance period for the TSR performance condition is the three years beginning 1 January 2022. For the purposes of measuring the TSR performance condition, the Company's TSR and that of the comparator group will be based on the 90-day average TSR for the period immediately preceding the start and end of the performance period.\n- 3. Reduction in CO2 intensity of shareholder assets and with-profit funds over the three-year performance period is aligned to Aviva Group's target of being Net Zero by 2040\n- 4.

Salary/fees, annual bonus and benefit amounts for the EDs, the Chair and the NEDs have been annualised where applicable to reflect what they would have been over a full 12-month period to aid comparison. The decrease in benefits for EDs reflects lower relocation and taxable travel and subsistence.\n- 2. The increase in fee levels for NEDs in 2020 are mainly driven by increases in fees effective July 2020\n- 3. Patrick Flynn was appointed as Senior Independent Director of Aviva plc and a Remuneration Committee member on 15 June and 7 September 2020 respectively\n- 4. Andrea Blance was appointed to the Board on 21 February 2022 and Mike Craston on 17 May 2022\n- 5. Shonaid Jemmett-Page joined the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee on 14 February 2022; she became chair of the Customer and Sustainability Committee on 17 May 2022\n- 6. Jim McConville stood down as Chair of the Customer and Sustainability Committee, remaining a member, on 17 May 2022\n- 7. Bel\u00e9n Romana Garc\u00eda and Patricia Cross stepped down from the Board on 9 May 2022\n- 8. Michael Mire stood down from the Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee on 14 September 2022\n- 9. The increase in taxable benefits for UK based employees in 2021, and subsequent decrease in 2022 has been mainly driven by the one-off recognition in 2021 of colleagues for their hard work during the pandemic. The taxable benefits also increased in 2021 due to the increase in the cost of private medical insurance. Without these items, benefits would have increased by 8.4 % in 2021 reflecting greater use of our online recognition platform.\n- 10. The increase in benefits for NEDs in 2022 compared to 2021 is largely reflective of the return of taxable travel and subsistence costs after the pandemic. The reduction in benefits in 2021 compared to 2020 is largely reflective of reduced taxable travel and subsistence costs due to the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total remuneration reflects all remuneration received by an individual in respect of the relevant years, and includes salary, benefits, bonus, pension, and value received from incentive plans.\n\n## Table 11 CEO Pay ratio table\n\nTable 12 Salary and total remuneration used in the CEO pay ratio calculations\n\n|   Year | Method   | P25  (lower quartile)   | P50 (median)   | P75  (upper quartile)   |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|\n|   2022 | Option A | 181:1                   | 127:1          | 76:1                    |\n|   2021 | Option A | 102:1                   | 70:1           | 42:1                    |\n|   2020 | Option A | 80:1                    | 56:1           | 34:1                    |\n|   2019 | Option A | 90:1                    | 63:1           | 37:1                    |\n\nWe would highlight the following in terms of the approach taken.\n\n- \u00b7 In calculating the ratio for 2020, the single figure for both Amanda Blanc and Maurice Tulloch in respect of their services as Group CEO were aggregated\n- \u00b7 In 2019, the single figure for Maurice Tulloch was aggregated with the pro rata fees for Sir Adrian Montague as Executive Chairman\n- \u00b7 The P25, P50 and P75 employees were calculated based on full-time equivalent data as at 31 December of the relevant years\n- \u00b7 Out of the three alternatives available for calculating the ratio, we chose to use Option A as it is considered to be the most accurate way of identifying employees at P25, P50 and P75, and is aligned with shareholder expectations. Under this approach we calculate total remuneration on a full-time equivalent basis for all of our UK employees and rank them accordingly.\n\nThe increase in the ratio reflects the fact that Amanda Blanc's first LTIP since becoming Group CEO vested during the year. The ratio for 2021 was therefore lower as no LTIP was due to vest for the CEO in respect of that year. Executive Directors receive a greater proportion of their remuneration in elements tied to performance, including participation in the LTIP. This means that the pay ratio will vary in large part due to incentive outcomes each year.\n\nAlthough the CEO pay ratio has increased, the total remuneration for each quartile employee has increased. This reflects the measures taken by Aviva to support our colleagues through the rising cost of living.\n\nTable 12 provides further information on the total remuneration figure for each quartile employee, and the salary component within this.\n\n| Year   | Pay element        | P25  (lower quartile)   | P50  (median)   | P75  (upper quartile)   |\n|--------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| 2022   | Salary             | \u00a325,667                 | \u00a333,875         | \u00a355,506                 |\n|        | Total remuneration | \u00a330,583                 | \u00a343,603         | \u00a372,530                 |\n\nIn reviewing the employee pay data, the Committee is comfortable that the P25, P50 and P75 individuals identified appropriately reflect the employee pay profile at those quartiles, and that the overall picture presented by the ratios is consistent with our pay, reward and progression policies for UK employees.\n\nAt Aviva, we are equally focused on our colleagues as we are on our customers. We recognise the individual needs of colleagues and we are proud of the reward, benefits and overall career packages that we offer our colleagues:\n\n- \u00b7 In the UK, we have been an accredited Real Living Wage employer since April 2014 and a Real Living Hours employer since October 2020. Our salaries are set above Real Living Wage to allow colleagues to save for their retirement and benefit from an employer pension contribution up to 14% whilst still earning the Real Living Wage.\n- \u00b7 We have a structured salary progression scheme for our frontline colleagues, providing salary increases to recognise colleagues as they develop and gain experience.\n- \u00b7 We conduct regular market reviews of our salary ranges in order to maintain competitiveness to market rates, and we move everyone who is below a band to at least the minimum of that range each year.\n- \u00b7 Our comprehensive, flexible benefits offering provides colleagues with the opportunity to select the benefits that matter most to them, and our range of inclusive colleague policies support life's big moments, including equal parental leave.\n- \u00b7 UK colleagues are eligible to participate in our SAYE and AESOP offerings with similar plans operating for many of our overseas colleagues. We are proud of the participation rates in these plans, with over 60% participating in the SAYE and over 70% in the AESOP, meaning colleagues both share in Aviva's success and benefit from tax-efficient savings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is at the same level as the current (within employment) guideline. The Committee retains the discretion to waive part or all of the guideline where considered appropriate, for example in exceptional or compassionate circumstances.\n- \u00b7 EDs are required to retain shares vesting from incentive plans within the Companysponsored nominee account, and are not permitted to transfer them, e.g. into their own brokerage accounts, unless otherwise agreed by the Committee. In this manner, the Committee is able to retain oversight of the shares and is comfortable that this provides the ability to enforce the post-cessation guidelines in practice and helps with the enforcement of malus and clawback.\n\n|                     |                   |                                                    | Shares held                                      | Shares held                                      | Options held               |                                          |                                      |                  |\n|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Executive Directors | Owned  outright 1 | Unvested and  subject to  performance conditions 2 | Unvested and  subject to  continued employment 3 | Unvested  and subject  to continued employment 4 | Vested  but not  exercised | Shareholding  requirement  (% of salary) | Current shareholding 5 (% of salary) | Requirement  met |\n| Amanda Blanc        |                   | 407,880   2,226,885                                | 343,715                                          | -                                                | -                          | 300                                      | 175                                  | No               |\n| Charlotte Jones 6   | -                 | 358,195                                            | -                                                | -                                                | -                          | 225                                      | -                                    | No               |\n| Jason Windsor 7     | 373,500           | -                                                  | -                                                | -                                                | -                          | 225                                      | 245                                  | Yes              |\n\n- 5.

For IFPR the 2022 AIGSL disclosure will be found, when published, at www.avivainvestors.com/en-gb/capabilities/regulatory/ and a link to the disclosure for the UK Insurance firms can be found at www.aviva.com/about-us/ remuneration-committee/\n\n## Solvency II remuneration\n\nRemuneration Requirements (PRA PS22/16 & SS10/16) apply to the Aviva Group. Our remuneration structures have been designed in a way that is compliant with these requirements for all senior managers across the Group, not just those identified as being specifically covered by the requirements of the regulation. Such employees at Aviva are termed 'Covered Employees'. We are required to complete a Remuneration Policy Statement, which outlines how we have complied with each of the requirements. This document is approved annually by the Group Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe Solvency II reporting requirements for the year ended 31 December 2022 necessitate firms to produce the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) which contains remuneration information and is publicly available. Aviva's reward principles and arrangements are designed to incentivise and reward employees for achieving stated business goals in a manner that is consistent with the Company's approach to sound and effective risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For 2023 awards, the Solvency II shareholder cover ratio is to meet or exceed the minimum of the stated working range (currently 160%)\n- 2. The Committee is mindful of the volatile economic environment and the impact of significant changes in key external variables such as interest rates on RoE outcomes. The Committee therefore will keep the economic assumptions and environment under review.\n- 3. Aviva's TSR performance will be assessed against that of the following companies: Admiral, Allianz, AXA, Direct Line Group, Hargreaves Lansdown, Hiscox, Intact, Legal & General, Lloyds Banking Group, M&G, Phoenix, Quilter and Zurich Insurance Group. 2023 TSR comparator group is unchanged from that used for the 2022 awards. The performance period for the TSR performance condition is the three years beginning 1 January 2023. For the purposes of measuring the TSR performance condition, the Company's TSR and that of the comparator group will be based on the 90-day average TSR for the period immediately preceding the start and end of the performance period.\n- 4.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\n## Our Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at our AGM on 6 May 2021 and will apply for a period of up to three years.\n\nThe full and definitive Policy is set out in our 2020 Annual report and accounts, which can be found on our website at www.aviva.com/reports/\n\nAlthough reproduced here for convenience, the 2021 Policy is our formally approved Policy and should be consulted where required. Please note the updates to the scenario charts to reflect 2023 remuneration arrangements for our EDs, as well as appointment end dates for NEDs.\n\n## Alignment of Group strategy with executive remuneration\n\nThe Committee considers that alignment between Group strategy and ED remuneration is critical. The Policy provides market competitive remuneration, and incentivises EDs to achieve the annual business plan and the Group's longer-term strategic objectives. Significant levels of deferral and shareholding requirements align EDs' interests with those of shareholders and aid retention of key personnel. Variable remuneration can be zero if performance thresholds are not met. Remuneration payments to directors can only be made if they are consistent with the approved Policy.\n\nTable 20 provides an overview of the Policy for EDs. The Policy for NEDs is in table 22.\n\nTable 20 Key aspects of the Policy for Executive Directors\n\n| Element      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Basic salary | Purpose To provide core market related pay  to attract and retain the required level  of talent.

This involves both core executive benefits, and the opportunity to participate in flexible benefits programmes offered by the Company (via salary sacrifice).\n\nThis enables us to attract and retain the right level of talent necessary to deliver the Company's strategy.\n\n## Operation\n\nBenefits are provided on a market related basis. The Company reserves the right to deliver benefits to EDs depending on their individual circumstances, which may include a cash car allowance, life insurance, private medical insurance and access to a company car and driver for business use. In the case of non-UK executives, the Committee may consider additional allowances in line with standard relevant market practice.\n\nEDs are eligible to participate in the Company's broad based employee share plans on the same basis as other eligible employees.\n\nSet at a level which the Committee considers appropriate against comparable roles in companies of a similar size and complexity to provide a reasonable level of benefit. Costs would normally be limited to providing a cash car allowance, private medical insurance, life insurance, and reasonable travel benefits (including the tax cost where applicable). In addition, there may be one-off or exceptional items on a case by case basis, which would be disclosed in the DRR.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are not compensated for performing the role but to defray costs of a relocation or residence outside the home country.\n\nThe Committee would reward no more than it judged reasonably necessary, in the light of all applicable circumstances.\n\n## Notes to the table:\n\n## Performance measures\n\nFor the annual bonus, performance measures are chosen to align to the Group's key performance indicators and include financial, strategic, risk, employee and customer measures. Achievement against individual strategic objectives is also taken into account.\n\nLTIP performance measures are chosen to provide an indication of both absolute and relative return generated for shareholders. In terms of target setting, a number of reference points are taken into account each year including, but not limited to, the Group's business plan and external market expectations of the Company. Maximum payouts require performance that significantly exceeds expected performance under both the annual bonus and the LTIP.\n\n## Quality of earnings assessments\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee engages in a regular quality of earnings assessment. A quality of earnings assessment sign-off is the final step in determining annual bonus scorecard outcomes, and is performed before vesting is determined against financial measures under the LTIP.\n\nAs a minimum, at any Committee meeting where LTIP vesting or annual bonus scorecard decisions are considered, the Chief Financial Controller prepares a report to the Committee on the quality of earnings reflected in the results being assessed, against performance targets. Extensive information from the audited accounts is used to explain the vesting and scorecard outcomes - ranging from movements in reserves, capital management decisions, consistency of accounting treatment and period to period comparability. The Chief Financial Controller attends the Committee meeting to answer any questions that any member of the Committee may choose to ask. Any vesting decision or confirmation of awards is made after this process has been undertaken.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nThe circumstances when malus (the forfeiture or reduction of unvested shares awarded under the ABP and LTIP) and clawback (the recovery of cash and share awards after release) may apply include (but are not limited to) where the Committee considers that the employee concerned has been involved in or partially/wholly responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 A materially adverse misstatement (as defined by the Board) of the Company's financial statements, or a misleading representation of performance;\n- \u00b7 A significant failure of risk management and/or controls;\n- \u00b7 A scenario or event which causes material reputational damage to the Company;\n\n<!-- image -->",

In relation to the outcomes under these plans, the Committee has unfettered discretion to adjust upward or downward (including to nil) the mechanical outcome where it considers that:\n\n- \u00b7 The outcome does not reflect the underlying financial or non-financial performance of the participant or the Group over the relevant period;\n- \u00b7 The outcome is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at the award date;\n- \u00b7 There exists any other reason why an adjustment is appropriate; and/or\n- \u00b7 It is appropriate to do so, taking into account a range of factors, including the management of risk and good governance and, in all cases, the experience of shareholders.\n\nOther discretions include, but are not limited to, the ability to set additional conditions and the discretion to change or waive those conditions. Such discretions would only be applied in exceptional circumstances, to ensure that awards properly reflect underlying business performance. Any use of the discretions and how they were exercised will be disclosed, where relevant, in the DRR and, where appropriate, be subject to consultation with Aviva's shareholders.\n\n## Change in control\n\nIn the event of a change in control, unless a new award is granted in exchange for an existing award, or if there is a significant corporate event like a demerger, awards under the LTIP would normally vest to the extent that the performance conditions have been satisfied as at the date of the change in control, and unless the Committee decides otherwise, would be pro-rated to reflect the time between the date of grant and the change in control event. Awards under the ABP would normally vest on the date of the change in control and may vest if there is a significant corporate event.\n\n## Consistency of executive Policy across the Group\n\nThe Policy for our EDs is designed as part of the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for the wider Group. Remuneration arrangements for employees below the EDs take account of the seniority and nature of the role, individual performance and local market practice. The components and levels of remuneration for different employees may therefore differ from the Policy for EDs.\n\nAny such elements are reviewed against market practice and approved in line with internal guidelines and frameworks.\n\nDifferentiation in reward outcomes based on performance and behaviour that is consistent with the Aviva values is a feature of how Aviva operates its annual bonus plan for its senior leaders and managers globally.\n\nA disciplined approach is taken to moderation across the Company in order to recognise and reward the key contributors. The allocation of LTIP awards also involves strong differentiation, with expected contribution and ability to collaborate effectively in implementation of the strategy driving award levels.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\n## Legacy payments\n\nThe Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretions available to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding that they are not in line with the Policy set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before May 2014 (the date the Company's first Policy came into effect), (ii) before the Policy set out above came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the Policy in force at the time they were agreed, or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of the Company. For these purposes, 'payments' includes the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Approach to recruitment remuneration\n\nOn hiring a new ED, the Committee would align the proposed remuneration package with the Policy in place for EDs at the time of the appointment.\n\nIn determining the actual remuneration for a new ED, the Committee would consider the package in totality, taking into account elements such as the skills and experience of the individual, local market benchmarks, remuneration practice, and the existing remuneration of other senior executives. The Committee would ensure any arrangements agreed would be in the best interests of Aviva and its shareholders. It would seek not to pay more than necessary to secure the right candidate.\n\nWhere considered appropriate the Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate to 'buyout' remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so, the Committee would take account of relevant factors including any performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which it was paid (e.g. cash or shares) and the timeframe of awards.\n\nBuyout awards would be awarded on a 'like for like' basis compared to remuneration being forfeited, and would be capped to reflect the value being forfeited. The Committee considers that a buyout award is a significant investment in human capital by Aviva, and any buyout decision will involve careful consideration of the contribution that is expected from the individual.\n\nThe maximum level of variable pay which could be awarded to a new ED, excluding any buyouts, would be in line with the Policy set out above and would therefore be no more than 550% of basic salary for the Group CEO (200% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant) and 500% of basic salary for other EDs (150% of basic salary annual bonus opportunity and 350% of basic salary as the face value of a LTIP grant).\n\nAll other elements of remuneration will also be in line with the Policy set out above.\n\nShould the Company have any prior commitments outside of this Policy in respect of an employee promoted internally to an ED position, the Committee may continue to honour these for a period of time. Where an ED is appointed from within the organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an ED is appointed following Aviva's acquisition of, or merger with, another company, legacy terms and conditions may be honoured.\n\nOn appointing a new NED, the Committee would align the remuneration package with the Policy for NEDs, outlined in table 22, including fees and travel benefits.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The charts are illustrative only and the actual value EDs could earn is subject to business performance and share price movement to the date of vesting of the LTIP and of the deferred share element of the annual bonus\n- 2. Fixed pay consists of basic salary, pension as described in table 1, and estimated value of benefits provided under the Policy, excluding any one offs. Actual figures may vary in future years.\n- 3. The value of the deferred element of the annual bonus assumes a constant share price and does not include additional shares awarded in lieu of dividends that may accrue during the vesting period\n- 4. The value of the LTIP assumes a constant share price (with the exception of the maximum with share price increase scenario) and does not include additional shares awarded in lieu of dividends that may accrue during the vesting period\n- 5. The LTIP is as proposed to be awarded in 2023, which would vest in 2026, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions. The shares would then be subject to a further two-year holding period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee has the ability to exercise its discretion on the final amount actually paid. Any compensation would be based on basic salary, pension entitlement and other contractual benefits during the notice period, or a payment made in lieu of notice, depending on whether the notice is worked.\n\nWhere notice of termination of a contract is given, payments to the ED would continue for the period worked during the notice period. Alternatively, the contract may be terminated, and phased monthly payments made in lieu of notice for, or for the balance of, the 12 months' notice period. During this period, EDs would be expected to mitigate their loss by seeking alternative employment. Payments in lieu of notice would be reduced by the salary received from any alternative employment, potentially to zero. The Company would typically make a reasonable contribution towards an ED's legal fees in connection with advice on the terms of their departure.\n\nThere is no automatic entitlement to an annual bonus for the year in which loss of office occurs. The Committee may determine that an ED may receive a pro rata bonus in respect of the period of employment during the year loss of office occurs based on an assessment of performance. Where an ED leaves the Company by reason of death, disability or ill health, or any other reason determined by the Committee, there may be a payment of a pro rata bonus for the relevant year at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nThe treatment of leavers under the ABP and LTIP is determined by the rules of the relevant plans. Good leaver status under these plans would be granted in the event of, for example, the death of an ED. Good leaver status for other leaving reasons is at the discretion of the Committee, taking into account the circumstances of the individual's departure, but would typically include planned retirement, or their departure on ill health grounds.\n\nIn circumstances where good leaver status has been granted, awards may still be subject to malus and clawback in the event that inappropriate conduct of the ED is subsequently discovered post departure, and retirees are subject to post-activity restrictions which allow the Committee to reduce or recover awards if certain employment is taken elsewhere. If good leaver status is not granted, all outstanding awards will lapse.\n\nIn the case of LTIP awards, where the Committee determines an ED to be a good leaver, vesting is normally based on the extent to which performance conditions have been met at the end of the relevant performance period, and the proportion of the award that vests is pro-rated for the time from the date of grant to final date of service (unless the Committee decides otherwise). Any decision not to apply this would only be made in exceptional circumstances and would be fully disclosed. It is not the practice to allow such treatment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Committee reviews levels of basic salary increases for other employees and executives based on their respective locations. It reviews changes in overall bonus pool funding and long-term incentive grants. The Committee considers feedback on pay matters from sources including the employee opinion survey and employee forums. The Committee also takes into account information provided by the people function and external advisers and the Committee Chair has in place a programme of consultation and meetings with employee forums including trade unions, Your Forum and the Evolution Council to discuss remuneration.\n- \u00b7 In its ongoing dialogue with shareholders, the Committee seeks shareholder views and takes them into account when any significant changes are being proposed to remuneration arrangements and when formulating and implementing the Policy. For example, there was detailed engagement with our largest shareholders regarding the proposed Policy during 2020, continuing into 2021.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors\n\nThe table below sets out details of our Policy for NEDs.\n\n## Table 22 Key aspects of the Policy for Non-Executive Directors\n\n## Element\n\n## Chair and NEDs' fees\n\n## Chair's travel benefits\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo attract individuals with the required range of skills and experience to serve as a Chair or as a NED.\n\n## Operation\n\nNEDs receive a basic annual fee in respect of their Board duties. Further fees are paid for membership and, where appropriate, chairing Board committees.\n\nThe Chair receives a fixed annual fee. Fees are reviewed annually taking into account market data and trends and the scope of specific Board duties. NEDs are able to use up to 100 % of their post-tax base fees to acquire shares in Aviva plc.\n\nThe Chair and NEDs do not participate in any incentive or performance plans or pension arrangements and do not receive an expense allowance.\n\nNEDs are reimbursed for reasonable expenses, and any tax arising on those expenses is settled directly by Aviva. To the extent that these are deemed taxable benefits, they will be included in the DRR, as required.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo provide the Chair with suitable travel arrangements for them to discharge their duties effectively.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association provide that the total aggregate remuneration paid to the Chair of the Company and NEDs will be determined by the Board within the limits set by shareholders and detailed in the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nThe Chair has access to a company car and driver for business use.

This Governance section, including the Directors' Remuneration Report, fulfils the requirements of the corporate governance statement under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.2.1.\n\n## Our policy on hedging\n\nThe hedging policy is disclosed in note 58(c) to the IFRS Financial Statements.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nRelated party transactions are disclosed in note 61 to the IFRS Financial Statements.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends for ordinary shareholders of Aviva plc are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Paid interim dividend of 10.3 pence per 32 17/19 pence ordinary share (2021: 7.35 pence per 25 pence ordinary share)\n- \u00b7 Proposed final dividend of 20.7 pence per 32 17/19 pence ordinary share (2021: 14.7 pence per 25 pence ordinary share)\n- \u00b7 Total ordinary dividend of 31.00 pence per 32 17/19 pence ordinary share (2021: 22.05 pence per 25 pence ordinary share)\n- \u00b7 Total cost of ordinary dividends paid in 2022 was \u00a3828 million (2021: \u00a31,110 million)\n\nSubject to shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM, the final dividend for 2022 will become due and payable on 18 May 2023 to all holders of ordinary shares on the Register of Members at the close of business on 31 March 2023, by reference to the number and nominal value of ordinary shares in issue at that time. (The payment date is approximately four business days later for holders of the Company's American Depositary Shares). In compliance with the rules issued by the Prudential Regulation Authority and other regulatory requirements to which the Group is subject, any final dividend declared by the Company is required to remain cancellable at any point prior to becoming due and payable and to be cancelled if, prior to payment, the Group ceases to hold capital resources equal to or in excess of its Solvency Capital Requirement, or if that would be the case if the dividend was paid. The directors have no intention of exercising this cancellation right, other than where they determine it may be necessary or appropriate to do so as a result of legal or regulatory requirements (including without limitation if, prior to payment, the Group ceases to hold capital resources equal to or in excess of its Solvency Capital Requirement, or if that would be the case if the dividend were paid). Details of any dividend waivers are disclosed in note 33 to the IFRS Financial Statements.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nIn light of our 2022 performance and resilient capital and liquidity, the Board has recommended a final dividend of 20.7 pence per 32 17/19 pence ordinary share (2021: 14.7 pence per 25 pence ordinary share), bringing the full year dividend in respect of 2022 financial year to 31.00 pence per 32 17/19 pence ordinary share (2021: 22.05 pence per 25 pence ordinary share). We recognise that dividends are important to our shareholders, with sustainable growth in cash generation an important driver of dividend capacity and in March 2022 Aviva provided clear guidance on dividends for the 2022 and 2023 financial years. For the period thereafter we anticipate low to mid-single digit growth in the cash cost of the dividend. This guidance is subject to market conditions and Board approval.\n\nUnder UK company law, we may only pay dividends if the Company has 'distributable profits' available. 'Distributable profits' are accumulated, realised profits/(losses) not previously distributed or capitalised, less accumulated, unrealised losses not previously written off based on IFRS. Even if distributable profits are available, we pay dividends only if the amount of our net assets is not less than the aggregate of our called-up share capital and nondistributable reserves and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of our net assets to less than that aggregate. As a holding company, the Company is dependent upon dividends and interest from our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report continued\n\nMany of the Company's subsidiaries are subject to insurance regulations that restrict the amount of dividends that they can pay to us.\n\nHistorically, the Company has declared an interim and a final dividend for each year (with the final dividend being paid in the following year).\n\nSubject to the restrictions set out above, the payment of interim dividends on ordinary shares is made at the discretion of the Board, while payment of any final dividend requires the approval of the Company's shareholders at a general meeting. Dividends on preference shares are made at the discretion of the Board.\n\nThe Company pays cash dividends in pounds sterling and euros, although the Articles of Association permit payment of dividends on ordinary shares in any currency and in forms other than cash, such as ordinary shares.\n\nInterim dividends are typically paid in September/October, subject to declaration by the Board. A final dividend is typically proposed by the Company's Board after the end of the relevant year and generally paid in May. Table 1 shows certain information regarding the dividends that we paid on the Company's ordinary shares.\n\n## Distributable reserves\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Aviva plc itself had sufficient distributable reserves to support the paid and proposed dividends during the period of our business plan. In Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, our largest operating subsidiary, distributable reserves, which could be paid to Aviva plc via its intermediate holding company, are based on the updated Companies Act 2006 (Distributions of Insurance Companies) Regulations 2016 which uses an adjusted Solvency II Own Funds measure in determining profits available for distribution.\n\nTable 1 Dividend information\n\n|   Year | Interim dividend  per share (pence)   |   Interim Dividend  per share (cents) 1 | Final dividend per  share (pence)   | Final dividend per  share (cents) 1   |\n|--------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|   2017 | 8.40                                  |                                    9.5  | 19.00                               | 21.77                                 |\n|   2018 | 9.25                                  |                                   10.25 | 20.75                               | 24.12                                 |\n|   2019 | 15.50  2                              |                                   17.35 | 0.00  3                             | 0.00                                  |\n|   2020 | 7.00                                  |                                    7.75 | 14.00                               | 16.15                                 |\n|   2021 | 7.35                                  |                                    8.6  | 14.70                               | 17.46                                 |\n|   2022 | 10.30                                 |                                   11.89 | 20.70                               | -                                     |\n\n- 1.

On 8 April 2020 the Board withdrew its recommendation to pay the 2019 final dividend, referencing the unprecedented challenges COVID-19 presented for businesses, households and customers and the adverse and highly uncertain impact on the global economy\n\nWhile the UK insurance regulatory laws applicable to UK Life and our other UK subsidiaries impose no statutory restrictions on an insurer's ability to declare a dividend, the rules require maintenance of each insurance company's solvency margin, which might impact their ability to pay dividends to the parent company.\n\nOur other life insurance, general insurance, and fund management subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends and make loans to the parent company is similarly restricted by local corporate or insurance laws and regulations. In all jurisdictions, when paying dividends, the relevant subsidiary must take into account its capital position and must set the level of dividend to maintain sufficient capital to meet minimum solvency requirements and any additional target capital expected by local regulators.\n\n## Acquisition of own shares\n\nOn 31 March 2022, Aviva completed the share buyback programme of ordinary shares originally announced on 12 August 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of up to \u00a3750 million and later increased and extended on 16 December 2021 to an aggregate purchase of up to \u00a31 billion. In total, 245,225,489 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were repurchased for an aggregate consideration of \u00a31 billion and a nominal value of \u00a361 million.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, 79,587,629 ordinary shares with the nominal value of \u00a319,896,907.25 (representing 2.154 % of the called up ordinary share capital as at 31 December 2022) were repurchased and cancelled during 2022, for an aggregate total consideration of \u00a3336,617,822.69. All repurchased shares have been cancelled.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net of new shares issued, in respect of the Company's employee share plans, during the period from 13 August to 31 March 2022, the number of shares in issue reduced by 242 million. Details of shares purchased, held or disposed by employee share plan trusts on the recommendation of the Company in 2022 for use in conjunction with the Company's employees' share plans are set out in note 33 to the IFRS Financial Statements.\n\n## Share class and listing\n\nAll the Company's shares in issue are fully paid up and the ordinary and preference shares have a Premium and Standard listing respectively on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nDetails of the Company's share capital and shares under option at 31 December 2022 and shares issued during the year are given in notes 31 to 34 to the IFRS Financial Statements. The calculation of earnings per share is included in note 13 to the IFRS Financial Statements.\n\n## Share capital\n\nDuring the year, 79,587,629 ordinary shares were cancelled following re-purchase by the Company as outlined above. On 9 May 2022, shareholders approved a return of capital and share consolidation. Through the return of capital, 3,687,322,000 B shares were issued and immediately redeemed. Through the share consolidation, 3,687,322,000 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were cancelled and replaced with 2,802,364,720\n\nordinary shares of 32 17/19 pence each. This resulted in a reduction of 884,957,280 ordinary shares. A total of 6,814,159 ordinary shares were allotted to satisfy amounts under the Group's employee share and incentive plans which comprised of 1,214,203 ordinary shares of 25 pence each and 5,599,956 ordinary shares of 32 17/19 pence each. At 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Issued ordinary share capital totalled 2,807,964,676 shares of 32 17/19 pence each (82% of total share capital)\n- \u00b7 Issued preference share capital totalled 200,000,000 shares of \u00a31 each (18% of total share capital)\n\nFurther details on the ordinary share capital of the Company are shown in note 31 to the IFRS Financial Statements.\n\n## Rights and obligations attaching to the Company's ordinary shares and preference shares\n\nRights and obligations attaching to the Company's shares together with the powers of the Company's directors are set out in the Company's Articles of Association (the Articles), copies of which can be obtained from Companies House and the Company's website at www.aviva.com/articles , or by writing to the Group Company Secretary. The powers of the Company's directors are subject to relevant legislation and, in certain circumstances (including in relation to the issue or buying back by the Company of its shares), are subject to authority being given to the directors by shareholders at a general meeting. At the 2023 AGM, shareholders will\n\nbe asked to renew the directors' authority to allot new securities. Details will be contained in the Notice of 2023 Annual General Meeting (Notice of AGM) due to be published at the end of March 2023.\n\n## Restrictions on transfer of securities/ voting rights\n\nWith the exception of restrictions under the Company's employee share incentive plans, where the shares are subject to the plan rules, there are no restrictions on the voting rights attaching to the Company's ordinary shares or the transfer of securities in the Company.\n\nWhere, under an employee share incentive plan operated by the Company, participants are the beneficial owners of shares but not the registered owners, the voting rights are normally exercised at the discretion of the participants. No person holds securities in the Company carrying special rights with regard to control of the Company. The Company is not aware of any agreements between holders of securities that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or voting rights.\n\n## Significant agreements change of control\n\nThere are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and joint venture agreements.\n\nNone are considered to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. All of the Company's employee share incentive plans contain provisions relating to a change of control. Outstanding awards and options would normally vest and become exercisable on a change of control, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions and pro rata reduction as may be applicable under the rules of the employee share incentive plans.\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nDetails of shares purchased during 2022 are outlined above (under 'Acquisition of own shares'). At the 2022 AGM, shareholders renewed the Company's authorities to make market purchases of up to 392 million ordinary shares, up to 100 million preference shares of 8\u00be% each and up to 100 million preference shares of 8\u215c% each. No shares have been purchased under this authority.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, shareholders will be asked to renew the authorities to buy the Company's shares for another year and the resolution in relation to the ordinary shares will once again propose a maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares which the Company can purchase of less than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital. Details are contained in the Notice of AGM available at www.aviva.com/agm . The Company held no treasury shares during the year or up to the date of this report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Information provided to the Company under the DTRs is publicly available via the regulatory information services and on the Company's website.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe directors as at the date of this report, together with their biographical details and details of Board appointments, resignations and retirements are shown earlier in the 'Our Board of Directors' section.\n\nThe rules regarding the appointment and removal of directors are contained in the Company's Articles. Under the Articles, the Board can appoint additional directors or appoint a director to fill a casual vacancy.\n\nThe new Director must retire at the first AGM following their appointment and can only continue as a Director if they are elected by shareholders at the AGM.\n\nAt no time during the year did any director hold a material interest in any contract of significance with the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings other than an indemnity provision between each director and the Company and employment contracts between each executive director and a Group company.

        "page_content": "## Directors' report continued\n\n## Going concern and longer-term viability\n\nA detailed going concern and longer-term viability review has been undertaken as part of the 2022 reporting process. The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic report, along with the Group's approach to risk and risk management. In addition, the 'Financial statements' sections include notes on the Group's borrowings (note 51); its contingent liabilities and other risk factors (note 54); its capital management (note 56); management of its risks including market, climate, credit and liquidity risk (note 58); and derivative financial instruments (note 59).\n\nThe going concern and longer-term viability review includes consideration of the Group's current and forecast solvency and liquidity positions over a three-year period which aligns to management's 2023-2025 business plan and evaluates the results of stress and scenario testing. Stress and scenario testing (including reverse stress testing) is used to test the resilience of business plans and to inform decision-making.\n\nThese tests are driven by the Group's risk profile at a range of severities, as well as a range of other scenarios as part of the Group solvency and liquidity management processes.\n\nThe Group continues to maintain strong solvency and liquidity positions through a range of scenarios and stress testing. Particular areas of uncertainty include credit downgrades where a specific focus has been our commercial mortgage portfolio which we continue to monitor closely and have taken several actions including debt restructuring. The Group's balance sheet exposure has been reviewed and actions taken to reduce the sensitivity to economic shocks.\n\nEven in severe downside scenarios, no material uncertainty in relation to going concern and longer-term viability has been identified, due to the Group's strong solvency and liquidity positions providing considerable resilience to external shocks, underpinned by the Group's approach to risk management (see note 58).\n\nIt is fundamental to the Group's longerterm strategy that the directors manage and monitor risk, considering all key risks the Group faces, including longer-term insurance risks, so that it can continue to meet its obligations to policyholders. The Group is also subject to extensive regulation and supervision under the UK Solvency II regulatory framework.\n\n## Going concern\n\nAfter making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group as a whole have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. For this reason, they continue to adopt, and to consider appropriate, the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\n## Longer-term viability statement\n\nThe directors have assessed the prospects of the Group in accordance with Provision 31 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, with reference to the Group's current position and prospects, its strategy, risk appetite, and the potential impact of the principal risks and how these are managed. Based on this assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year assessment period to 31 December 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under that law the directors have prepared the Group and parent financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make reasonable and prudent judgements and accounting estimates;\n- \u00b7 state where applicable the directors have prepared the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards; and\n- \u00b7 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and Group, enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and,\n\n## Listing Rules requirements\n\nFor the purposes of Listing Rule (LR) 9.8.4C R, the information required to be disclosed by LR 9.8.4 R can be found in the following locations:\n\n|   Section in LR 9.8.4C R | Topic                                   | Location in the Annual Report  and Accounts   |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|                       12 | Shareholder waivers of dividends        | IFRS Financial Statements - note 33           |\n|                       13 | Shareholder waivers of future dividends | IFRS Financial Statements - note 33           |\n\nBy order of the Board on 8 March 2023.\n\n## Amanda Blanc\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\nas regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nThe directors are responsible for making, and continuing to make, the Company's Annual Report and Accounts available on the Company's website. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's and the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nEach of the current directors whose names and functions are detailed in the 'Our Board of Directors' section and in the Directors' and Corporate Governance report confirm that, to the best of their knowledge: the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group; and the Strategic report and the Directors' and Corporate Governance report in this Annual report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nThis is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.\n\nThe asset class of corporate bonds has been added to the credit default assumption key audit matter this year. Furthermore, the disclosures in Note 62 in accordance with International Accounting Standard (\"IAS\") 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' in relation to the impact on the opening balance sheet as a result of adopting IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' for the period beginning 1 January 2023 is a new key audit matter this year. Otherwise the key audit matters below are consistent with last year.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of life insurance liabilities (Group)\n\nRefer to Accounting policy (L) 'Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities - Long-term business provisions' and Note 41 Insurance liabilities (b) Long-term business liabilities.\n\nFor UK Life insurance liabilities, the valuation of the long-term business provision for the settlement of future claims involves complex and subjective judgements about future events, both internal and external to the business, for which small changes in assumptions can result in material impacts to the valuation of these liabilities.\n\nAs part of our consideration of the entire set of assumptions, we focused particularly on the following three assumptions given the level of judgement involved in their determination, and the sensitivity of the valuation of the insurance liabilities to them:\n\n- \u00b7 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of annuity business insurance liabilities (\"annuitant mortality\");\n- \u00b7 Credit default assumptions for illiquid assets and corporate bonds; and\n- \u00b7 Expense assumptions.\n\nWe provide more detailed consideration of each of these below.\n\nThe work to address the valuation of the life insurance liabilities included the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Understood and evaluated the process and the design and implementation of controls in place to determine the life insurance liabilities;\n- \u00b7 Tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls in place over life insurance liabilities, including those covering the approval of assumptions, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used;\n- \u00b7 Using our actuarial specialist team members, applied industry knowledge and experience and compared the methodology, models and assumptions used against recognised actuarial practice. This included consideration of the reasonableness of assumptions against actual historical experience, and the appropriateness of any judgements applied, including if there was any indication of management bias;\n- \u00b7 Tested the key judgements over the preparation of the life insurance liabilities, including manual calculation of components focusing on the consistency in treatment and methodology yearon-year and with reference to recognised actuarial practice;\n- \u00b7 Used the results of an independent PwC annual benchmarking survey of assumptions to further challenge the assumption setting process by comparing certain assumptions used relative to the Group's industry peers; and\n- \u00b7 Assessed the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nAs part of our consideration of the entire set of assumptions, we focused particularly on annuitant mortality, credit default for illiquid assets and corporate bonds, and expense assumptions given their significance to the Group's result and the level of judgement involved.\n\nThese aspects of our work have been considered in more detail below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The differing factors which affect the assumptions are underlying mortality experience (in the portfolio), industry and management's views on the future rate of mortality improvements, and external factors arising from developments in the annuity market.\n\nThere are two main components to the annuitant mortality assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Mortality base assumption: this component is typically less subjective as it is derived using the external Continuous Mortality Investigation (\"CMI\") tables for individual annuities and Club Vita 3 (\"CV3\") tables for Bulk Purchase Annuities (\"BPA\"), adjusted for internal experience. However, judgement is required in choosing the appropriate table and fitting Aviva's own experience to this table. In setting this assumption, management opted to exclude 2020 and 2021 experience from the analysis, as a result of the distorting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and maintained the same external mortality tables as at 31 December 2021;and\n- \u00b7 Rate of mortality improvements: this component is more subjective given the uncertainty over how life expectancy will change in the future and the lack of available data to support judgements made in respect of this. In setting this assumption, management has adopted the latest CMI model (CMI 2021) and dataset, whilst maintaining the specific parameters for the longterm rate and adjustments to reflect the profile of the portfolio.\n\nIn respect of the annuitant mortality assumptions we performed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the methodology used by management to derive the assumptions with reference to relevant rules and actuarial guidance and by applying our industry knowledge and experience. This included evaluating management's decision to retain the existing base tables, published in mid-2020, as well as to move to the latest CMI model (CMI 2021) and dataset for determining both improvements and the margin for prudence;\n- \u00b7 Assessed the reasonableness of the base mortality assumptions. This included assessing the judgement applied by management in excluding 2020 and 2021 data from the experience investigation due to the distorting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n- \u00b7 Considered the reasonableness of other assumptions, including those unchanged, such as the socio-economic group adjustments, following the move to the latest CMI model. We performed this by assessing the continued appropriateness of these elements of the mortality improvement basis against the impact arising from the change in the CMI model.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the assumptions used for annuitant mortality to be appropriate.\n\n## Credit default assumptions for illiquid assets (commercial mortgages and equity release mortgages) and corporate bonds (Group)\n\nRefer to Accounting policy (L) 'Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities - Long-term business provisions' and Note 42 Insurance liabilities methodology and assumptions (a) Long-term business.\n\nLife Insurance liabilities are valued by discounting expected future cash flows at an interest rate based on the yield of assets backing the liabilities, allowing for a prudent deduction for the credit risk associated with holding these assets.\n\nUK Life has substantial holdings in asset classes with significant credit risk. For illiquid assets, the underlying asset valuation requires a number of different assumptions. Internally developed models are then used to project the associated cash flows for the assets, using these assumptions, to calculate the asset value and associated credit risk.\n\nThere is a heightened risk around the corporate bonds credit default assumptions for the year ended 31 December 2022, relating to the methodology and judgements applied in the calculation of credit default allowances being no longer materially appropriate given the current heightened economic uncertainty. We have consequently included this asset class within this key audit matter.\n\nThe calculated credit risk for illiquid assets and corporate bonds is converted into credit default assumptions for each asset type. These assumptions are then uplifted by a prudence margin and used, alongside credit default assumptions for other assets, in the calculation of the valuation interest rate used to value life insurance liabilities.\n\nIn respect of the credit default assumptions for illiquid assets, we performed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the methodology and the credit risk pricing models used by management to derive the assumptions for commercial and equity release mortgages. This included consideration of the relevant rules and actuarial guidance, such as the adoption of an appropriate prudence margin, and by applying our industry knowledge and experience; and\n- \u00b7 Validated the significant assumptions used by management by ensuring consistency with the assumptions used for the valuation of the illiquid assets, and by considering any additional judgements applied, market observable data (to the extent available and relevant) and our experience of market practice.\n\nIn respect of the credit default assumptions for corporate bonds, we performed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the appropriateness of the methodology used by management. This included consideration of the relevant rules and actuarial guidance, such as the adoption of an appropriate prudence margin, and by applying our industry knowledge and experience; and\n- \u00b7 Assessed the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the calculation of the credit default assumption, with a focus on recent market volatility.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the assumptions used for credit default risk on illiquid assets (commercial mortgages and equity release mortgages) and corporate bonds to be appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The assumptions reflect the expected future expenses that will be required to maintain the inforce policies at the balance sheet date, including an allowance for project costs and a margin for prudence.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, inflation is significantly higher than historical rates. There is also significant uncertainty around future inflation and how inflation will vary across the economy. This increases the materiality and risk associated with judgements applied in the calculation of expense inflation.\n\nIn respect of the expense assumptions, we performed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested the methodology used by management to derive the assumptions with reference to relevant rules and actuarial guidance and by applying our industry knowledge and experience. This included testing the split of expenses between acquisition and maintenance expenses by agreeing a sample to supporting evidence;\n- \u00b7 Tested that the assumptions appropriately reflect the expected future expenses for maintaining policies in force at the balance sheet date, which includes consideration of the allowance for project costs and planned controlled cost reduction; and\n- \u00b7 Tested the actuarial reserving models to ensure that the expense assumptions continue to be applied appropriately within the models, and assessed the appropriateness of new and existing maintenance expense manual provisions.\n\nIn respect of the excess inflation assumption, we performed the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Considered the reasonableness of the expense inflation assumption with respect to market views of inflation as at 31 December 2022. This included the reasonableness of any adjustments made to market inflation to set the expense inflation assumption.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the expense assumptions to be appropriate.\n\n## Valuation of general insurance liabilities (Group)\n\nRefer to Accounting policy (L) 'Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities - General insurance and health provisions' and Note 41 Insurance liabilities (c) General insurance and health liabilities.\n\nGeneral insurance liabilities include the provision for claims incurred but not reported (\"claims IBNR\"). The estimation of these liabilities involves a significant degree of judgement in determining the valuation of the provision for claims IBNR as at 31 December 2022.\n\nWe focused particularly on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the costs of claims for general insurance products, in particular assumptions relating to the expected settlement amount and settlement patterns of claims, including personal injury lump sum compensation amounts;\n- \u00b7 The underlying volatility attached to estimates for the larger classes of business such as the motor accounts, where small changes in assumptions can lead to large changes in the level of the estimate held and the reported combined operating ratio (\"COR\");\n- \u00b7 The magnitude of uncertainty in respect of rising inflation in claims costs and its impact on assumptions adopted in the determination of claims IBNR; and\n- \u00b7 The risk of inappropriate assumptions in determining the impact of COVID-19 on the provision for claims IBNR.\n\nOur work focused on the provision for claims IBNR in the UK General Insurance and Canada General Insurance components, given their size in relation to the consolidated Group and the subjectivity of the judgements involved.\n\nWe assessed the calculation of the general insurance liabilities by performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Understood and evaluated the process and the design and implementation of controls in place to determine the provision for claims IBNR. This included testing the design and operating effectiveness of the relevant controls in place, and the completeness and accuracy of data used;\n- \u00b7 Tested the underlying data to source documentation;\n- \u00b7 Using our actuarial specialist team members, applied our industry knowledge and experience and compared the methodology, models and assumptions used against recognised actuarial practices. This included consideration of the reasonableness of assumptions against actual historical experience and the appropriateness of any judgements applied;\n- \u00b7 Using our actuarial specialist team members, independently estimated the provision for claims IBNR on selected classes of business, particularly focusing on the reserves for larger and higher risk classes. For these classes, we compared our estimates which included assumptions in respect of inflation, that we determined were appropriate, to those booked by management, to determine whether the provision for claims IBNR represented a reasonable estimate;\n- \u00b7 For the remaining classes, which include business interruption losses arising as a direct result of COVID-19 we evaluated the methodology and assumptions applied, or performed key indicator tests to identify and investigate any anomalies;\n- \u00b7 Considered whether any of our audit procedures gave rise to an indication of management bias in the estimates; and\n- \u00b7 Assessed the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nBased on the work performed and evidence obtained, we consider the methodology and assumptions used to value the general insurance liabilities to be appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Independent auditors' report to the members of Aviva plc continued\n\n## Disclosure of the impact of adopting IFRS 17 (Group)\n\nRefer to Accounting policy (A(i)) 'Basis of preparation - IFRS 17, Insurance contracts' and Note 62 IFRS 17 Transition.\n\nInternational Accounting Standard 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' ('IAS 8') requires the disclosure of reasonably estimable information relevant to assessing the possible impact of new accounting standards issued but not yet effective. International Financial Reporting Standard 17 'Insurance Contracts' , ('IFRS 17' or the 'standard') became effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, replacing International Financial Reporting Standard 4, Insurance Contracts. The related IAS 8 disclosures in section A of the Accounting Policies and in Note 62 of these financial statements are intended to provide readers with an understanding of the estimated impact of the new standard on the transition date of 1 January 2022 and, as a result, are more limited than the disclosures which will be required within the 2023 interim and annual reports and accounts. Management has estimated the impact of the transition to IFRS 17 on the Group's opening total equity position and the resultant recognition of the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM') as at the transition date, 1 January 2022, and disclosed these impacts in accordance with IAS 8.\n\nWe determined the disclosure of the impact of IFRS 17 to be an area of focus because of the significant changes introduced by the standard, which includes a number of new estimates and judgements, and because the impacts will be of particular importance to the readers of these financial statements. In particular, we have focused on the following key judgements that management have taken in calculating the impact of implementing IFRS 17:\n\n- \u00b7 The determination of the transition approach adopted for each group of insurance contracts;\n- \u00b7 The methodology used by management to determine discount rates;\n- \u00b7 The methodology and assumptions in respect of determining the risk adjustment;\n- \u00b7 The methodology applied to the amortisation of the CSM for annuities where the fully retrospective approach is being applied;\n- \u00b7 The methodology that has been used to determine the fair value CSM on transition for annuity and with-profits business;\n- \u00b7 The assumptions made by management in determining the fair value of annuity liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 The calculations performed in management's new models; specifically models relating to annuities and with-profits business for the fair value approach, annuities for the full retrospective approach, and the risk adjustment models.\n\n## Valuation of investments in subsidiaries (Company)\n\nRefer to Accounting policy (D) 'Consolidation principles - The Company's investments' and Note E to the Financial Statements of the Company Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture.\n\nIn the Company's statement of financial position, investments in subsidiaries are reported at cost less impairment. The investments in subsidiaries are the largest assets on the Company's statement of financial position. There is a risk that the carrying value of the investments in subsidiaries exceeds the recoverable amount and therefore an impairment loss should be recognised.\n\nIn respect of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries we have:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtained management's assessment of impairment indicators in investments in subsidiaries and tested relevant key inputs;\n- \u00b7 Evaluated whether there is an impact on the carrying value of the investment based on our understanding of the business and accounting treatment; and\n- \u00b7 Tested the disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n\nBased on the work performed and the evidence obtained, we consider the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries to be appropriate.\n\nIn respect of our audit work over the valuation of the estimated impact on the Group's opening total equity position and the recognition of the CSM as at 1 January 2022, we performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Understood and evaluated the design effectiveness of controls in place, and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant data integrity and management controls, and substantively tested relevant data inputs;\n- \u00b7 Assessed whether the judgements applied by management in determining their accounting policies are in accordance with IFRS 17;\n- \u00b7 Using our actuarial specialist team members, evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology used to determine discount rates as at 1 January 2022 and historic periods where the fully retrospective approach is adopted;\n- \u00b7 Applied industry knowledge and compared the methodology, models and assumptions used in determining the risk adjustment, CSM, fair value of annuity liabilities and IFRS 17 best estimate liabilities against expected market practice. This included consideration of the reasonableness of assumptions and the appropriateness of any judgements applied, including whether or not there was any indication of management bias;\n- \u00b7 Tested the mathematical accuracy of the supporting calculations and adjustments used to determine the impact on the Group's opening total equity position and the recognition of the CSM as at 1 January 2022; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluated the reasonableness of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures included in the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of IAS 8.\n\nBased on the audit procedures performed and evidence obtained, we consider the disclosures related to the initial impact of IFRS 17, and key judgements and assumptions to be appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also performed audit procedures over the corporate centre operations and the consolidation process, as well as over certain other Group activities, including specific account balances in the Aviva Employment Services, Aviva Central Services, and Aviva Group Holdings components.\n\nWe completed review procedures over the other components not subject to full scope audits.\n\nAs the Group audit team, we determined the level of involvement required at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient and appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. In our role as Group auditors, we exercised oversight of the work performed by auditors of the components including performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Issued Group instructions outlining areas requiring additional audit focus, including the key audit matters above;\n- \u00b7 Maintained an active dialogue with reporting component audit teams throughout the year;\n- \u00b7 Attended meetings with local management;\n- \u00b7 Reviewed reporting requested from component teams, including those areas determined to be of heightened audit risk; and\n- \u00b7 Met with all full scope components and reviewed the detailed working papers, where relevant.\n\n## The impact of climate risk on our audit\n\nWe have made enquiries of management (both within and outside of the Group's finance functions) in order to understand the extent of the impact of climate change risks and the commitments made by the Group on the Group's financial statements. As part of this, we have reviewed minutes of meetings of the Aviva Sustainability Ambition (\"ASA\") Steering Committee and reviewed the Group's climate reporting framework. We have also made enquiries to understand, and performed a risk assessment in respect of, the commitments made by the Group and how these may affect the financial statements and the audit procedures that we perform. We have assessed the risks of material misstatement to the financial statements as a result of climate change and concluded that for the year ended 31 December 2022, the main audit risks are related to consistency of disclosures included within the Annual Report and 'other information' including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (\"TCFD\") report. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that there was no impact on our key audit matters.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the year ended 31 December 2022, we have  determined that a 3-year average of this metric is more  appropriate as it normalises both economic and non-economic | In determining our materiality, we considered financial  metrics which we believed to be relevant and  concluded, consistent with prior year, that total equity  was the most appropriate benchmark. The primary use  of the financial statements is to determine the entity's  ability to pay dividends, and the users will therefore be  focused on a total equity benchmark. |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was \u00a334,000,000 - \u00a388,000,000. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall Group materiality.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to \u00a369,000,000 (2021: \u00a3107,000,000) for the Group financial statements and \u00a349,400,000 (2021: \u00a365,990,000) for the Company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a34,600,000 (Group audit) (2021: \u00a37,000,000) and \u00a33,200,000 (Company audit) (2021: \u00a34,400,000) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group's and the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Obtaining the directors' Going Concern assessment and challenging the rationale for the downside scenarios adopted and material assumptions made using our knowledge of Aviva's business performance, review of regulatory correspondence and obtaining further corroborating evidence;\n- \u00b7 Considering the directors' assessment of the regulatory solvency coverage and liquidity position in the forward looking scenarios considered, which have been derived from Aviva's Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (\"ORSA\");\n- \u00b7 Considering information obtained during the course of the audit and publicly available market information to identify any evidence that would contradict the directors' assessment of going concern (including the impacts of COVID-19); and\n- \u00b7 Enquiring and understanding the actions taken by the directors to mitigate the risks arising from the impacts of economic uncertainty, including review of Board Risk Committee minutes and attendance of all Audit Committees.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the directors' reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The directors are responsible for the other information, which includes reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\") recommendations. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.\n\nBased on our work undertaken in the course of the audit, the Companies Act 2006 requires us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.\n\n## Strategic report and Directors' report\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the Strategic report and Directors' report for the year ended 31 December 2022 is consistent with the financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic report and Directors' report.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Annual report on Remuneration to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Corporate governance statement\n\nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors' statements in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the corporate governance statement relating to the Company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- \u00b7 The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the Group's and Company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the Group's and Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the Group and Company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the Group's and Company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- \u00b7 The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to breaches of UK and European regulatory principles, such as those governed by the Prudential Regulation Authority (\"PRA\") and the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls) and determined that the principal risks were related to management bias in accounting estimates and judgmental areas of the financial statements as shown in our 'Key Audit Matters'. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- \u00b7 Discussions with the Board, management, Internal Audit, senior management involved in the Risk and Compliance functions and Group and Company's legal function, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of management's controls designed to prevent and detect irregularities;\n- \u00b7 Assessment of matters reported on the Group and Company's whistleblowing helpline and fraud register and the results of management's investigation of such matters;\n- \u00b7 Meeting with the PRA periodically and reading key correspondence with the PRA and the FCA, including those in relation to compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing relevant meeting minutes including those of the Board of Directors, Audit, Remuneration and Disclosure Committees;\n- \u00b7 Identifying and testing journal entries based on risk criteria;\n- \u00b7 Designing audit procedures to incorporate unpredictability around the nature, timing or extent of our testing;\n- \u00b7 Testing transactions entered into outside of the normal course of the Group and Company's business;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the Group's register of litigation and claims, Internal Audit reports, and Compliance reports in so far as they related to noncompliance with laws and regulations and fraud; and\n- \u00b7 Attendance at Audit and Risk Committee meetings.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.\n\nOur audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: www.frc.org.uk/ auditorsresponsibilities .

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nAviva plc (the 'Company'), a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK), together with its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group' or 'Aviva') transacts life assurance and long-term savings business, fund management and most classes of general insurance and health business through its subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches in the UK, Ireland, Canada and Asia.\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## (A) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements and those of the Company have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the legal requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nOn 31 December 2020, IFRS as adopted by the EU at that date was brought into UK law and became UK-adopted International Accounting Standards, with future changes being subject to endorsement by the UK Endorsement Board. The Group transitioned to UK-adopted international accounting standards on 1 January 2021.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, investment property, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, the Group has applied existing accounting practices for insurance and participating investment contracts, modified as appropriate to comply with the IFRS framework and applicable standards. Further details are given in accounting policy L.\n\nItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency). The consolidated financial statements are stated in pounds sterling, which is the Company's functional and presentational currency. Unless otherwise noted, the amounts shown in these financial statements are in millions of pounds sterling (\u00a3m).\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the Group and/or the Company\n\nThe Group and/or the Company has adopted the following amendments to standards which became effective for the annual reporting period beginning on 1 January 2022. The amendments have been issued and endorsed by the UK and do not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements to IFRS 2018-2020 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 16 Leases and IAS 41 Agriculture (published by the IASB in May 2020)\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (published by the IASB in May 2020)\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework (published by the IASB in May 2020)\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (published by the IASB in May 2020)\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (published by the IASB in March 2021)\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Group or the Company\n\nThe following new standards and amendments to existing standards have been issued, are not yet effective for the Group and have not been adopted early by the Group:\n\n## (i)  IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB published IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts. Amendments to the standard were published in June 2020 and December 2021 (Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 -Comparative Information). In May 2022, the UK endorsed both IFRS 17 and the amendments, all of which apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, which was issued in 2005. In contrast to the requirements in IFRS 4, which are largely based on grandfathering of previous local accounting policies, IFRS 17 provides a comprehensive and consistent approach to accounting for insurance contracts.\n\nThe measurement and presentation of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features are significantly impacted by the transition to IFRS 17. Further details, including the expected financial impacts on Group equity at the transition date of 1 January 2022, are given in note 62.\n\n## (ii)  IFRS 9, Financial Instruments\n\nIn September 2016, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts that addressed the accounting consequences of the application of IFRS 9 to insurers prior to implementing IFRS 17. Under the deferral approach set out in the amendments, the Group has elected to apply the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. The Group has however been required to apply the additional disclosure requirements of IFRS 4 which are set out in notes 22 and 58. Eligibility for the deferral approach was based on an assessment of the Group's liabilities as at 31 December 2015, in accordance with the date specified in the amendments to IFRS 4. At this date the Group's liabilities connected with insurance exceeded 90% of the carrying amount of the Group's total liabilities. The Group's total liabilities were \u00a3369,642 million and liabilities connected with insurance in the statement of financial position at this date primarily included insurance and participating investment contracts within the scope of IFRS 4 (\u00a3218,604 million), non-participating investment contract liabilities (\u00a3103,125 million), unallocated divisible surplus (\u00a38,811 million), borrowings (\u00a38,770 million), and certain amounts within payables and other financial liabilities which arise in the course of writing insurance business (\u00a310,285 million).\n\nIn November 2016, the EU endorsed IFRS 9, followed by the Amendments to IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts - deferral of IFRS 9 in December 2020, which extends the fixed expiry date for the temporary exemption for insurers from applying IFRS 9 from 1 January 2021 until 1 January 2023, to align the effective dates with IFRS 17 Insurance contracts.\n\nIFRS 9 incorporates new classification and measurement requirements for financial assets, the introduction of an expected credit loss impairment model which will replace the incurred loss model of IAS 39, and new hedge accounting requirements. Under IFRS 9, all financial assets will be measured at either amortised cost or fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The standard retains most of IAS 39's requirements for financial liabilities except for those designated at fair value through profit or loss whereby that part of the fair value changes attributable to own credit is to be recognised in other comprehensive income instead of the income statement.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, entities have the option to restate prior periods on transition. The Group will elect to restate comparatives in line with the IFRS 17 approach for restatement. We have assessed the interaction of IFRS 9 with IFRS 17 and intend to continue to apply the Group's current policy of measuring the majority of its financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, hence we do not expect any significant measurement differences on adoption of IFRS 9. There will be changes to presentation and disclosures, including reflecting the business model assessment required for classification of financial investments under IFRS 9.\n\nThe Company is not eligible to apply the deferral approach and has adopted IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 information relating to entities within the Group which have applied IFRS 9 from 1 January 2018 can be found in the entities' publicly available individual financial statements.\n\n## (iii) Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure of Accounting Policies\n\nPublished by the IASB in January 2020.

The APM incorporates the expected return on investments which supports its long-term and non-long-term businesses.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities. Variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit. For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is analysed between that calculated using a longer-term return and short-term fluctuations from that level. The exclusion of short-term realised and unrealised investment gains and losses from the Group adjusted operating profit APM reflects the long-term nature of much of our business and presents separately the operating profit APM which is used in managing the performance of our operating segments from the impact of economic factors. Further details of this analysis and the assumptions used are given in notes 7 and 8.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit excludes impairment of goodwill, associates and joint ventures; amortisation and impairment of intangibles acquired in business combinations; amortisation and impairment of acquired value of in-force business; and the profit or loss on disposal and remeasurement of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. These items principally relate to mergers and acquisition activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from the operating profit APM as this is principally used to manage the performance of our operating segments when reporting to the Group's chief operating decision maker.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit also excludes other items, which are those items that, in the directors' view, are required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. Details of these items, including an explanation of the rationale for their exclusion, are provided in the Alternative Performance Measures section within 'Other information'.\n\nThe Group adjusted operating profit APM should be viewed as complementary to IFRS GAAP measures. It is important to consider Group adjusted operating profit and profit before tax together to understand the performance of the business in the period.\n\n## (C) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the Group to select accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of financial position, other primary statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements and assumptions applied and the appropriateness of significant accounting policies. The significant judgements considered by the Committee in the year are included within the Audit Committee Report and summarised in the following table.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk. Contracts that transfer financial risks, but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts. Judgement is required to assess whether insurance risk is significant at inception of the contract. Some insurance and investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature which is a supplement to guaranteed benefits. Judgement is required to determine whether discretionary additional benefits are likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual payments.\n\n## Financial Investments (accounting policy - T)\n\nClassification of investments including the application of the fair value option.\n\nThe Group classifies its investments as either fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or available for sale (AFS). The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired and is determined by local management at initial recognition.\n\nAll estimates are based on management's knowledge of current facts and circumstances, assumptions based on that knowledge and their predictions of future events and actions. Actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.\n\nThe table below sets out those estimates considered particularly susceptible to changes in assumptions, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, and the relevant accounting policy and note disclosures.\n\n| Significant accounting estimates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Assumptions   | Carrying  values    | Sensitivity   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n| Measurement of insurance and participating  investment contract liabilities (accounting  policy - L)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |               |                     | note          |\n| Principal assumptions used in the calculation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | note          | note                |               |\n| of life insurance and participating investment  contract liabilities include those in respect of  annuitant mortality, expenses, valuation                                                                                                                                                                                                | 41(b)         | 40(a),  Note  43(a) | 58(h)         |\n| T, U)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |               |                     |               |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | note          |                     |               |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 22(g)         |                     | 22(g)         |\n| Fair value of financial instruments and  investment property (accounting policy - F,  Where quoted market prices are not  available, valuation techniques are used to  value financial instruments and investment  property.

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## (D) Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an investee if and only if the Group has all of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 power over the investee;\n- \u00b7 exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and\n- \u00b7 the ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns.\n\nThe Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including: the purpose and design of an investee, relevant activities, substantive and protective rights, and voting rights and potential voting rights.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.\n\n## Investment vehicles\n\nIn several countries, the Group has invested in a number of specialised investment vehicles such as Open-ended Investment Companies (OEICs) and unit trusts. These invest mainly in equities, bonds, cash and cash equivalents, and properties, and distribute most of their income.\n\nIn determining whether the Group controls such vehicles, primary considerations include whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent (including an assessment of the substantive removal rights of third parties) and the variability in the returns associated with the Group's aggregate economic interest in the fund (direct interest and expected management fees) relative to the total variability of returns.\n\nAdditionally, the Group's percentage ownership in these vehicles can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the level of participation of the Group and third-parties. To avoid transitory or minor changes in fund holdings (which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement) resulting in binary changes in the consolidation conclusions, the Group takes into account the trend of ownership over a period of time. This is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 40%, the Group is judged to have control over the entity;\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 40%, the facts and circumstances of the Group's involvement in the entity are considered, in forming a judgement as to whether the Group has control over the entity. Considerations include the rights held by other parties, the Group's rights to fees from the entity, the variability in the returns associated with the Group's aggregate economic interest in the fund and the nature of the Group's exposure to variability compared with that of other investors; and\n- \u00b7 Where the entity is managed by a Group asset manager, and the Group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the Group is judged to not have control over the entity.\n\nWhere the Group is deemed to control such vehicles, they are consolidated, with the interests of parties other than Aviva being classified as liabilities. These appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unitholders' in the consolidated statement of financial position. The interest of parties other than Aviva in the investment return on these funds appear as 'Investment expense/(income) attributable to unitholders' in the income statement.\n\nWhere the Group does not control such vehicles, and these investments are held by its insurance or investment funds, they are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments in the consolidated statement of financial position, in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.\n\nAs part of their investment strategy, long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships (PLPs), either directly or via property unit trusts (PUTs), through a mix of capital and loans. The PLPs are managed by general partners (GPs), in which the long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs. The PUTs are managed by a Group subsidiary.\n\nAccounting for the PUTs and PLPs as subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates or other financial investments depends on whether the Group is deemed to have control or joint control over the PUTs and PLPs' shareholdings in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement are considered along with other factors that determine control, as outlined above.\n\nWhere the Group exerts control over a PUT or a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.\n\nWhere the partnership is managed by an agreement such that there is joint control between the parties, notwithstanding that the Group's partnership share in the PLP (including its indirect stake via the relevant PUT and GP) may be lower or higher than 50%, such PUTs and PLPs have been classified as joint ventures (see below). Where the Group has significant influence over the PUT or PLP, as defined in the following section, the PUT or PLP is classified as an associate. Where the Group holds non-controlling interests in PLPs, with no significant influence or control over their associated GPs, the relevant investments are carried at fair value through profit or loss within financial investments.\n\n## Consolidation procedure\n\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date the Group obtains control and are excluded from consolidation from the date the Group loses control. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned on acquisition to ensure consistency with Group policies.\n\nThe Group is required to use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under this method, the Group recognises identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group has the option to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill (see accounting policy O below). Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that lead to changes in the ownership interests in a subsidiary but do not result in a loss of control are treated as equity transactions.\n\n## Merger accounting and the merger reserve\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, the date of first time adoption of IFRS, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the 'pooling of interests method' (or merger accounting), which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nMerger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiary's own share capital and share premium account. These transactions have not been restated, as permitted by the IFRS 1 transitional arrangements.\n\nThe merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control. Generally, it is presumed that the Group has significant influence if it has between 20% and 50% of voting rights.\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Group and other parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture.\n\nJoint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In a number of these, the Group's share of the underlying assets and liabilities may be greater or less than 50% but the terms of the relevant agreements make it clear that control is not exercised. Such jointly controlled entities are referred to as joint ventures in these financial statements.\n\nGains on transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and joint ventures. Losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred between entities.\n\nOther than investments in investment vehicles which are carried at fair value through profit or loss, investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the cost of the investment in a given associate or joint venture, together with the Group's share of that entity's post-acquisition changes to shareholders' funds, is included as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position. As explained in accounting policy O, the cost includes goodwill recognised on acquisition. The Group's share of their postacquisition profit or losses is recognised in the income statement and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves. Equity accounting is discontinued when the Group no longer has significant influence or joint control over the investment.\n\nIf the Group's share of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the undertaking, the Group does not recognise further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the entity.\n\n## The Company's investments\n\nIn the Company's statement of financial position, subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are stated at cost less impairment. Investments are reviewed annually to test whether any indicators of impairment exist. Where there is objective evidence of such an asset being impaired the investment is impaired to its recoverable value and any unrealised loss is recorded in the income statement.\n\n## (E) Foreign currency translation\n\nIncome statements and cash flows of foreign entities are translated into the Group's presentation currency at average exchange rates for the year while their statements of financial position are translated at the year-end exchange rates. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the currency translation reserve or the hedging instrument reserve within equity. On disposal of a foreign entity, such exchange differences are transferred out of this reserve and are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. The cumulative translation differences were deemed to be zero at the transition date to IFRS.\n\nForeign currency transactions are accounted for at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nTranslation differences on debt securities and other monetary financial assets measured at fair value and designated as held at FVTPL (see accounting policy T) are included in foreign exchange gains and losses in the income statement. For monetary financial assets designated as AFS, translation differences are calculated as if they were carried at amortised cost and so are recognised in the income statement, while foreign exchange differences arising from fair value gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and included in the investment valuation reserve within equity. Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equities which are designated as FVTPL, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss, whereas such differences on AFS equities are included in the investment valuation reserve.\n\n## (F) Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. This presumes that the transaction takes place in the principal (or most advantageous) market under current market conditions. Fair value is a market-based measure and in the absence of observable market prices in an active market, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe fair value of a non-financial asset is determined based on its highest and best use from a market participant's perspective. When using this approach, the Group takes into account the asset's use that is physically possible, legally permissible and financially feasible.\n\nThe best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is normally the transaction price i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. In certain circumstances, the fair value at initial recognition may differ from the transaction price.\n\nIf the fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging), or is based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets, then the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is recognised as a gain or loss in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nWhen unobservable market data has a significant impact on the valuation of financial instruments, the difference between the fair value at initial recognition and the transaction price is not recognised immediately in the income statement, but deferred and recognised in the income statement on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out or otherwise matured.\n\nIf an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, the price within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances is used to measure fair value.\n\n## (G) Product classification\n\nInsurance contracts are defined as those containing significant insurance risk if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, excluding scenarios that lack commercial substance, at the inception of the contract.\n\nSuch contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Contracts that transfer financial risks, but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nSome insurance and investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature, which is a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits (i) that are likely to be a significant portion of the total contractual payments; (ii) whose amount or timing is at the discretion of the issuer; and (iii) that are based on the performance of a specified pool of assets, company, or other entity that issues the contracts. Investment contracts with discretionary participation features, referred to as participating investment contracts, are accounted for under IFRS 4. Investment contracts without discretionary participation features, referred to as non-participating investment contracts, are accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39.\n\nThe classification of the Group's main contracts is summarised below:\n\n| Type of contract                                     | Classification                                          |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annuities                                            | Insurance contract                                      |\n| Unit-linked with significant  insurance risk         | Insurance contract                                      |\n| Unit-linked without significant  insurance risk      | Investment contract                                     |\n| Protection                                           | Insurance contract                                      |\n| General insurance (e.g. motor,  property, liability) | Insurance contract                                      |\n| Health                                               | Insurance contract                                      |\n| With-profits                                         | Insurance contract / Participating  investment contract |\n\nAs noted in accounting policy A, insurance contracts and participating investment contracts in general continue to be measured and accounted for under existing accounting practices at the later of the date of transition to IFRS ('grandfathered') or the date of the acquisition of the entity, in accordance with IFRS 4. IFRS accounting for insurance contracts in UK companies was grandfathered at the date of transition to IFRS and determined in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice issued by the Association of British Insurers (subsequently withdrawn by the ABI in 2015).\n\nIn certain businesses, the accounting policies or accounting estimates have been changed, as permitted by IFRS 4 and IAS 8 respectively, to remeasure designated insurance liabilities to reflect current market interest rates and changes to regulatory capital requirements. When accounting policies or accounting estimates have been changed, and adjustments to the measurement basis have occurred, the financial statements of that year will have disclosed the impacts accordingly. One such example is our adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 27 Life Assurance (FRS 27) which was issued by the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) in December 2004 (subsequently withdrawn by the ASB in 2015).\n\n## (H) Premiums earned\n\nPremiums on long-term insurance contracts and participating investment contracts are recognised as income when receivable, except for investment-linked premiums which are accounted for when the corresponding liabilities are recognised. For single premium business, this is the date from which the policy is effective. For regular premium contracts, receivables are recognised at the date when payments are due.\n\nPremiums are shown before deduction of commission and before any sales-based taxes or duties. Where policies lapse due to nonreceipt of premiums, then all the related premium income accrued but not received from the date they are deemed to have lapsed is offset against premiums.\n\nGeneral insurance and health premiums written reflect business incepted during the year, and exclude any sales-based taxes or duties. Unearned premiums are those proportions of the premiums written in a year that relate to periods of risk after the statement of financial position date. Unearned premiums are calculated on either a daily or monthly pro rata basis. Premiums collected by intermediaries, but not yet received, are assessed based on estimates from underwriting or past experience, and are included in premiums written.\n\nDeposits collected under investment contracts without a discretionary participation feature (non-participating contracts) are not accounted for through the income statement, except for the fee income (covered in accounting policy I) and the investment income attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the investment contract liability.\n\n## (I) Other investment contract fee revenue\n\nInvestment contract policyholders are charged fees for policy administration, investment management, surrenders or other contract services. The fees may be for fixed amounts or vary with the amounts being managed, and will generally be charged as an adjustment to the policyholder's balance. Fees related to investment management services are recognised as revenue over time, as performance obligations are satisfied. In most cases this revenue is recognised in the same period in which the fees are charged to the policyholder. Fees that are related to services to be provided in future periods are deferred and recognised when the performance obligation is fulfilled. Variable consideration, such as performance fees and commission subject to clawback arrangements, is not recognised as revenue until it is reasonably certain that no significant reversal of amounts recognised would occur.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nInitiation and other 'front-end' fees (fees that are assessed against the policyholder balance as consideration for origination of the contract) are charged on some non-participating investment and investment fund management contracts. Where the investment contract is recorded at amortised cost, these fees are deferred and recognised over the expected term of the policy by an adjustment to the effective yield. Where the investment contract is measured at fair value, the front-end fees that relate to the provision of investment management services are deferred and recognised as the services are provided. Origination fees are recognised immediately where the sale of fund interests represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## (J) Other fee and commission income\n\nOther fee and commission income consists primarily of fund management fees, distribution fees from mutual funds, commissions on reinsurance ceded, commission revenue from the sale of mutual fund shares and transfer agent fees for shareholder record keeping. Reinsurance commissions receivable are deferred in the same way as acquisition costs, as described in accounting policy X. All other fee and commission income is recognised over time as the services are provided.\n\n## (K) Net investment income\n\nInvestment income consists of dividends, interest and rents receivable for the year, movements in amortised cost on debt securities, realised gains and losses, and unrealised gains and losses on FVTPL investments (as defined in accounting policy T). Dividends on equity securities are recorded as revenue on the exdividend date. Interest income is recognised as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the investment. It includes the interest rate differential on forward foreign exchange contracts. Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis, and is recognised on a straight line basis unless there is compelling evidence that benefits do not accrue evenly over the period of the lease.\n\nA gain or loss on a financial investment is only realised on disposal or transfer, and is the difference between the proceeds received, net of transaction costs, and its original cost or amortised cost, as appropriate.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses, arising on investments which have not been derecognised as a result of disposal or transfer, represent the difference between the carrying value at the year end and the carrying value at the previous year end or purchase value during the year, less the reversal of previously recognised unrealised gains and losses in respect of disposals made during the year. Realised gains or losses on investment property represent the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the property.\n\n## (L) Insurance and participating investment contract liabilities\n\nClaims\n\nLong-term business claims reflect the cost of all claims arising during the year, including claims handling costs, as well as policyholder bonuses accrued in anticipation of bonus declarations.\n\nGeneral insurance and health claims incurred include all losses occurring during the year, whether reported or not, related handling costs, a reduction for the value of salvage and other recoveries, and any adjustments to claims outstanding from previous years.\n\nClaims handling costs include internal and external costs incurred in connection with the negotiation and settlement of claims. Internal costs include all direct expenses of the claims department and any part of the general administrative costs directly attributable to the claims function.\n\n## Long-term business provisions\n\nUnder current IFRS requirements, insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are measured using accounting policies consistent with those adopted previously under existing accounting practices, with the exception of liabilities remeasured to reflect current market interest rates to be consistent with the value of the backing assets, and those relating to UK with-profits and nonprofit contracts.\n\nThe long-term business provisions are calculated separately for each life operation, based either on local regulatory requirements or existing local GAAP (at the later of the date of transition to IFRS or the date of the acquisition of the entity); and actuarial principles consistent with those applied in each local market. Each calculation represents a determination within a range of possible outcomes, where the assumptions used in the calculations depend on the circumstances prevailing in each life operation. The principal assumptions are disclosed in note 42(a). For the UK with-profits funds, FRS 27 required liabilities to be calculated on the realistic basis adjusted to remove the shareholders' share of future bonuses.\n\nFRS 27 was grandfathered from UK regulatory requirements prior to the adoption of Solvency II. For UK non-profit insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated using the gross premium valuation method. This method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses. These assumptions are set on a prudent basis and can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience. These estimates depend upon the outcome of future events and may need to be revised as circumstances change. The liabilities are based on the UK regulatory requirements prior to the adoption of Solvency II, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business.\n\n## Unallocated divisible surplus\n\nIn certain participating long-term insurance and investment business, the nature of the policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain. Amounts whose allocation to either policyholders or shareholders has not been determined by the end of the financial year are held within liabilities as an unallocated divisible surplus.\n\nIf the aggregate carrying value of liabilities for a particular participating business fund is in excess of the aggregate carrying value of its assets, then the difference is held as a negative unallocated divisible surplus balance, subject to recoverability from margins in that fund's participating business. Any excess of this difference over the recoverable amount is charged to net income in the reporting period.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nEmbedded derivatives that meet the definition of an insurance contract or correspond to options to surrender insurance contracts for a set amount (or based on a fixed amount and an interest rate) are not separately measured. All other embedded derivatives are separated and measured at fair value if they are not considered closely related to the host insurance contract or do not meet the definition of an insurance contract. Fair value reflects own credit risk to the extent the embedded derivative is not fully collateralised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Liability adequacy\n\nAt each reporting date, an assessment is made of whether the recognised long-term business provisions are adequate, using current estimates of future cash flows. If that assessment shows that the carrying amount of the liabilities (less related assets) is insufficient in light of the estimated future cash flows, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up an additional provision in the statement of financial position.\n\n## General insurance and health provisions Outstanding claims provisions\n\nGeneral insurance and health outstanding claims provisions are based on the estimated ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the statement of financial position date, whether reported or not, together with related claims handling costs. Significant delays are experienced in the notification and settlement of certain types of general insurance claims, particularly in respect of liability business, including environmental and pollution exposures, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date. As such, booked claim provisions for general insurance and health insurance are based on the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty. Any estimate represents a determination within a range of possible outcomes. Further details of estimation techniques are given in note 42(b).\n\nProvisions for latent claims and claims that are settled on an annuity type basis such as structured settlements are discounted, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims and the nature of the liabilities.\n\nThe discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change. The range of discount rates used is described in note 42(b). Outstanding claims provisions are valued net of an allowance for expected future recoveries. Recoveries include noninsurance assets that have been acquired by exercising rights to salvage and subrogation under the terms of insurance contracts.\n\n## Provision for unearned premiums\n\nThe proportion of written premiums, gross of commission payable to intermediaries, attributable to subsequent periods is deferred as a provision for unearned premiums. The change in this provision is taken to the income statement as recognition of revenue over the period of risk.\n\n## Liability adequacy\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews its unexpired risks and carries out a liability adequacy test for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums, using the current estimates of future cash flows under its contracts after taking account of the investment return expected to arise on assets relating to the relevant general business provisions.\n\nIf these estimates show that the carrying amount of its insurance liabilities (less related deferred acquisition costs) is insufficient in light of the estimated future cash flows, the deficiency is recognised in the income statement by setting up a provision in the statement of financial position.\n\n## Other assessments and levies\n\nThe Group is subject to various periodic insurance-related assessments or guarantee fund levies. Related provisions are established where there is a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event. Such amounts are not included in insurance liabilities but are included under 'Pension deficits and other provisions' in the statement of financial position.\n\n## (M) Non-participating investment contract liabilities\n\n## Claims\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts with an account balance, claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nDeposits collected under non-participating investment contracts are not accounted for through the income statement, except for the investment income attributable to those contracts, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the investment contract liability.\n\nThe majority of the Group's contracts classified as non-participating investment contracts are unit-linked contracts and are measured at fair value.\n\nThe liability's fair value is determined using a valuation technique to provide a reliable estimate of the amount for which the liability could be transferred in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, subject to a minimum equal to the surrender value. For unit-linked contracts, the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units. In addition, if required, non-unit reserves are held based on a discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nFor non-linked contracts, the fair value liability is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, with allowance for risk calibrated to match the market price for risk.\n\n## (N) Reinsurance\n\nThe Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business, with retention limits varying by line of business. Premiums on reinsurance assumed are recognised as revenue in the same manner as they would be if the reinsurance were considered direct business, taking into account the product classification of the reinsured business.\n\nThe cost of reinsurance related to long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies, using assumptions consistent with those used to account for these policies.\n\nWhere general insurance liabilities are discounted, any corresponding reinsurance assets are also discounted using consistent assumptions.\n\nGains or losses on buying retroactive reinsurance are recognised in the income statement immediately at the date of purchase and are not amortised. Premiums ceded and claims reimbursed are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position as appropriate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nReinsurance assets primarily include balances due from both insurance and reinsurance companies for ceded insurance and investment contract liabilities. This includes balances in respect of investment contracts which are legally reinsurance contracts but do not meet the definition of a reinsurance contract under IFRS. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the underlying contract liabilities, outstanding claims provisions or settled claims associated with the reinsured policies and in accordance with the relevant reinsurance contract.\n\nReinsurance of non-participating investment contracts and reinsurance contracts that principally transfer financial risk are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position. A deposit asset or liability is recognised, based on the consideration paid or received less any explicitly identified premiums or fees to be retained by the reinsured. These deposit assets or liabilities are shown within reinsurance assets in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nIf a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount accordingly and recognises that impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after initial recognition of the reinsurance asset, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.\n\n## (O) Goodwill, AVIF and intangible assets Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Goodwill arising on the Group's investments in subsidiaries is shown as a separate asset, while that on associates and joint ventures is included within the carrying value of those investments.\n\nGoodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004 (the date of transition to IFRS) is carried at its book value (original cost less cumulative amortisation) on that date, less any impairment subsequently incurred. Goodwill arising before 1 January 1998 was eliminated against reserves and has not been reinstated.\n\nWhere negative goodwill arises on an acquisition, this is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Acquired value of in-force business (AVIF)\n\nThe present value of future profits on a portfolio of long-term insurance and investment contracts, acquired either directly or through the purchase of a subsidiary, is recognised as an asset.\n\nIf the AVIF results from the acquisition of an investment in a joint venture or an associate, it is held within the carrying amount of that investment. In all cases, the AVIF is amortised over the useful lifetime of the related contracts in the portfolio on a systematic basis. The rate of amortisation is chosen by considering the profile of the additional value of in-force business acquired and the expected depletion in its value.\n\nNon-participating investment contract AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment, consistent with reviews conducted for other finite life intangible assets. Insurance and participating investment contract AVIF is reviewed for impairment at each reporting date as part of the liability adequacy requirements of IFRS 4 (see accounting policy L). AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment and impairment tested at product portfolio level by reference to a projection of future profits arising from the portfolio.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets consist primarily of contractual relationships such as access to distribution networks, customer lists and software. The economic lives of these are determined by considering relevant factors such as usage of the asset, typical product life cycles, potential obsolescence, maintenance costs, the stability of the industry, competitive position and the period of control over the assets. Finite life intangibles are amortised over their useful lives, which range from three to 30 years, using the straight-line method.\n\nThe amortisation charge for the year is included in the income statement under 'Other expenses'. For intangibles with finite lives, impairment charges will be recognised in the income statement where evidence of such impairment is observed.\n\nIntangibles with indefinite lives are subject to regular impairment testing, as described below.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nFor impairment testing, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives have been allocated to cash-generating units. The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is reviewed at least annually or when circumstances or events indicate there may be uncertainty over this value. Goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are written down for impairment where the recoverable amount is insufficient to support its carrying value. Further details on goodwill allocation and impairment testing are given in note 15. Any impairments are charged as expenses in the income statement.\n\n## (P) Property and equipment\n\nOwner-occupied properties are carried at their revalued amounts, and movements are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to a separate reserve within equity. When such properties are sold, the accumulated revaluation surpluses are transferred from this reserve to retained earnings. These properties are depreciated down to their estimated residual values over their useful lives.\n\nThis excludes owner-occupied properties held under lease arrangements, which are measured at amortised cost. Refer to accounting policy Z for further information.\n\nAll other items classed as property and equipment within the statement of financial position are carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nInvestment properties under construction are included within property and equipment until completion, and are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their values until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write down the cost of other assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u2022 Properties under construction\n\nNo depreciation\n\n- \u2022 Owner-occupied properties, and related mechanical and electrical equipment\n\n25 years\n\n- \u2022 Motor vehicles\n\nThree years, or lease term (up\u00a0to useful life) if longer\n\n- \u2022 Computer equipment\n\nThree to five years\n\n- \u2022 Other assets\n\nThree to five years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nThe assets' residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed regularly, and at least at each financial year end, and adjusted if appropriate. Where the carrying amount of an asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are determined by reference to their carrying amount.\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of property and equipment are capitalised. All repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. The cost of major renovations is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits in excess of the most recently assessed standard of performance of the existing asset will flow to the Group and the renovation replaces an identifiable part of the asset. Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset.\n\n## (Q) Investment property\n\nInvestment property is held for long-term rental yields and is not occupied by the Group. Completed investment property is stated at its fair value, as assessed by qualified external valuers or by qualified staff of the Group. Changes in fair values are recorded in the income statement in net investment income.\n\nAs described in accounting policy P above, investment properties under construction are included within property and equipment, and are stated at cost less any impairment in their values until construction is completed or fair value becomes reliably measurable.\n\n## (R) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nProperty and equipment and other non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment losses whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows. Nonfinancial assets, except goodwill which have suffered an impairment, are reviewed annually for possible reversal of the impairment.\n\n## (S) Derecognition and offset of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised where:\n\n- \u00b7 The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired;\n- \u00b7 The Group retains the right to receive cash flows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; or\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and has either transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position when there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is the ability and intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (T) Financial investments\n\nThe Group classifies its investments as either FVTPL or AFS.\n\nThe classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired, and is determined by management at initial recognition. The FVTPL category has two subcategories those that meet the definition as being held for trading and those the Group chooses to designate as FVTPL (referred to in this accounting policy as 'other than trading') upon initial recognition.\n\nIn general, the other than trading category is used as, in most cases, the Group's investment or risk management strategy is to manage its financial investments on a fair value basis. Debt securities and equity securities, which the Group acquires with the intention to resell in the short term, are classified as trading, as are non-hedge derivatives (see accounting policy U below). The AFS category is used where the relevant long-term business liability (including shareholders' funds) is passively managed, as well as in certain fund management and non-insurance operations.\n\nPurchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets, at their fair values.\n\nDebt securities are initially recorded at their fair value, which is taken to be amortised cost, with amortisation credited or charged to the income statement. Investments classified as trading, other than trading and AFS, are subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of trading and other than trading investments are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.\n\nChanges in the fair value of securities classified as AFS are recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in a separate investment valuation reserve within equity. When securities classified as AFS are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are transferred out of the investment valuation reserve to the income statement with a corresponding movement through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying value of its AFS investments on a regular basis. If the carrying value of an AFS investment is greater than the recoverable amount, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the income statement in the period of impairment. The following policies are used to determine the level of any impairment, some of which involve considerable judgement.\n\n## AFS debt securities\n\nAn AFS debt security is impaired if there is objective evidence that a loss event has occurred which has impaired the expected cash flows, i.e. where all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security are not considered collectible. An impairment charge, measured as the difference between the security's fair value and amortised cost, is recognised when the issuer is known to be either in default or in financial difficulty. Determining when an issuer is in financial difficulty requires the use of judgement, and we consider a number of factors including industry risk factors, financial condition, liquidity position and near-term prospects of the issuer, credit rating declines and a breach of contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any subsequent increase in fair value of these impaired securities is recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in the investment valuation reserve unless this increase represents a decrease in the impairment loss that can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the income statement. In such an event, the reversal of the impairment loss is recognised as a gain in the income statement.\n\n## AFS equity securities\n\nAn AFS equity security is considered impaired if there is objective evidence that the cost may not be recovered. In addition to qualitative impairment criteria, such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Unless there is evidence to the contrary, an equity security is considered impaired if the decline in fair value relative to cost has been either at least 20% for a continuous six-month period or more than 40% at the end of the reporting period, or been in an unrealised loss position for a continuous period of more than 12 months at the end of the reporting period. We also review our largest equity holdings for evidence of impairment, as well as individual equity holdings in industry sectors known to be in difficulty. Where there is objective evidence that impairment exists, the security is written down regardless of the size of the unrealised loss.\n\nFor securities identified as being impaired, the cumulative unrealised loss previously recognised within the investment valuation reserve is transferred to realised losses for the year with a corresponding movement through other comprehensive income.\n\nAny subsequent increase in fair value of these impaired securities is recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in the investment valuation reserve.\n\nReversals of impairments on any of these assets are only recognised where the decrease in the impairment can be objectively related to an event occurring after the write-down (such as an improvement in the debtor's credit rating), and are not recognised in respect of equity instruments.\n\n## (U) Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nDerivative financial instruments include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate futures, currency and interest rate swaps, currency and interest rate options (both written and purchased) and other financial instruments that derive their value mainly from underlying interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit or equity indices, commodity values or equity instruments.\n\nAll derivatives are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at their fair value, which usually represents their cost. They are subsequently remeasured at their fair value, with the method of recognising movements in this value depending on whether they are designated as hedging instruments and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged. Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices or, if these are not available, by using valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models. All derivatives are carried as assets when the fair values are positive and as liabilities when the fair values are negative. Premiums paid for derivatives are recorded as an asset on the statement of\n\nfinancial position at the date of purchase, representing their fair value at that date.\n\nDerivative contracts may be traded on an exchange or over-thecounter (OTC). Exchange-traded derivatives are standardised and include certain futures and option contracts. OTC derivative contracts are individually negotiated between contracting parties and include forwards, swaps, caps and floors. Derivatives are subject to various risks including market, liquidity and credit risk, similar to those related to the underlying financial instruments. Many OTC transactions are contracted and documented under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements or their equivalent, which are designed to provide legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, reducing the Group's exposure to credit risk.\n\nThe notional or contractual amounts associated with derivative financial instruments are not recorded as assets or liabilities on the statement of financial position as they do not represent the fair value of these transactions. These amounts are disclosed in note 59(b).\n\nThe Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties. Accounting policy W covers collateral, both received and pledged, in respect of these derivatives.\n\n## Interest rate and currency swaps\n\nInterest rate swaps are contractual agreements between two parties to exchange fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments, calculated on a specified notional amount and defined interest rates. Most interest rate swap payments are netted against each other, with the difference between the fixed and floating rate interest payments paid by one party. Currency swaps, in their simplest form, are contractual agreements that involve the exchange of both periodic and final amounts in two different currencies. Both types of swap contracts may include the net exchange of principal. Exposure to gain or loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as a function of maturity dates, interest and foreign exchange rates, and the timing of payments.\n\n## Interest rate futures, forwards and options contracts\n\nInterest rate futures are exchange-traded instruments and represent commitments to purchase or sell a designated security or money market instrument at a specified future date and price.\n\nInterest rate forward agreements are OTC contracts in which two parties agree on an interest rate and other terms that will become a reference point in determining, in concert with an agreed notional principal amount, a net payment to be made by one party to the other, depending upon what rate prevails at a future point in time. Interest rate options, which consist primarily of caps and floors, are interest rate protection instruments that involve the potential obligation of the seller to pay the buyer an interest rate differential in exchange for a premium paid by the buyer. This differential represents the difference between current rate and an agreed rate applied to a notional amount. Exposure to gain or loss on all interest rate contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as interest rates fluctuate. Certain contracts, known as swaptions, contain features which can act as swaps or options.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nForeign exchange contracts, which include spot, forward and futures contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nForeign exchange option contracts are similar to interest rate option contracts, except that they are based on currencies, rather than interest rates.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nHedge accounting is applied to certain transactions which meet the criteria set out in IAS 39, in order to mitigate the Group's exposure to risk. At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. The Group also documents its assessment of whether the hedge is expected to be, and has been, highly effective in offsetting the risk in the hedged item, both at inception and on an ongoing basis.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges) or a hedge of a future cash flow, attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction or a firm commitment (cash flow hedges), and that prove to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk, are recognised in other comprehensive income and a separate reserve within equity. Gains and losses accumulated in this reserve are included in the income statement on disposal of the relevant hedged item.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedges) are recognised in the income statement. The gain or loss on the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThis applies even if the hedged item is an available for sale financial asset or is measured at amortised cost. If a hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement, based on a recalculated effective interest rate over the residual period to maturity. In cases where the hedged item has been derecognised, the cumulative adjustment is released to the income statement immediately.\n\nThe Group does not currently apply the specific hedge accounting rules to its derivative transactions which are treated as derivatives held for trading. The fair value gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised immediately in net investment income.\n\n## (V) Loans\n\nLoans with fixed maturities, including policyholder loans, mortgage loans on investment property, securitised mortgages and collateral loans, are recognised when cash is advanced to borrowers.\n\nCertain loans are carried at their unpaid principal balances and adjusted for amortisation of premium or discount, non-refundable loan fees and related direct costs. These amounts are deferred and amortised over the life of the loan as an adjustment to loan yield using the effective interest rate method.\n\nHowever, for the majority of mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage of the fair value option under IAS 39 to present the mortgages, associated borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise from using different measurement bases for these three items. The fair values of these mortgages are estimated using discounted cash flow models, based on a risk-adjusted discount rate which reflects the risks associated with these products. They are revalued at each period end, with movements in their fair values being taken to the income statement.\n\nAt each reporting date, we review loans carried at amortised cost for objective evidence that they are impaired and uncollectable, either at the level of an individual security or collectively within a group of loans with similar credit risk characteristics. To the extent that a loan is uncollectable, it is written down as impaired to its recoverable amount, measured as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan, taking into account the fair value of the underlying collateral through an impairment provision account. Subsequent recoveries in excess of the loan's written-down carrying value are credited to the income statement.\n\nThe Company classifies and measures loans at either amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the outcome of an assessment of the Company's business model for managing financial assets and the extent to which the financial assets' contractual cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nThe Company calculates expected credit losses for all financial assets held at either amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Expected credit losses are calculated on either a 12-month or lifetime basis depending on the extent to which credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\n## (W) Collateral\n\nThe Group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of stock lending transactions, certain derivative contracts and loans, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. Collateral is also pledged as security for bank letters of credit. The amount and type of collateral required depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.\n\nCollateral received in the form of cash, which is not legally segregated from the Group, is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position with a corresponding liability for the repayment in financial liabilities (note 60). However, where the Group has a currently enforceable legal right of set-off and the ability and intent to net settle, the collateral liability and associated derivative balances are shown net.\n\nNon-cash collateral received is not recognised in the statement of financial position unless the transfer of the collateral meets the derecognition criteria from the perspective of the transferor. Such collateral is typically recognised when the Group either (a) sells or repledges these assets in the absence of default, at which point the obligation to return this collateral is recognised as a liability; or (b) the counterparty to the arrangement defaults, at which point the collateral is seized and recognised as an asset.\n\nCollateral pledged in the form of cash, which is legally segregated from the Group, is derecognised from the statement of financial position with a corresponding receivable recognised for its return. Non-cash collateral pledged is not derecognised from the statement of financial position unless the Group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement, and therefore continues to be recognised in the statement of financial position within financial investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## (X) Deferred acquisition costs and other assets\n\nCosts relating to the acquisition of new business for insurance and participating investment contracts are deferred in line with existing local accounting practices, to the extent that they are expected to be recovered out of future margins in revenues on these contracts. For participating contracts written in the UK, acquisition costs are generally not deferred as the liability for these contracts is calculated on a realistic basis which was grandfathered from UK regulatory requirements prior to the adoption of Solvency II (see accounting policy L). For non-participating investment and investment fund management contracts, incremental acquisition costs and sales enhancements that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service are also deferred.\n\nLong-term business deferred acquisition costs are amortised systematically over a period no longer than that in which they are expected to be recoverable out of these future margins. Deferred acquisition costs for non-participating investment and investment fund management contracts are amortised over the period in which the service is provided. General insurance and health deferred acquisition costs are amortised over the period in which the related revenues are earned. The reinsurers' share of deferred acquisition costs is amortised in the same manner as the underlying asset.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs are reviewed by category of business at the end of each reporting period and are written-off where they are no longer considered to be recoverable.\n\nWhere such business is reinsured, an appropriate proportion of the deferred acquisition costs is attributed to the reinsurer. Recoverability is assessed net of reinsurance, and may result in deferred acquisition costs being written-off if any liability recognised for the reinsurer's share is insufficient.\n\nOther receivables and payables are initially recognised at cost, being fair value. Subsequent to initial measurement they are measured at amortised cost.\n\n## (Y) Statement of cash flows Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks, treasury bills and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such investments are those with less than three months' maturity from the date of acquisition, or which are redeemable on demand with only an insignificant change in their fair values.\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents also include bank overdrafts, which are included in payables and other financial liabilities on the statement of financial position.\n\n## Operating cash flows\n\nPurchases and sales of investment property, loans and financial investments are included within operating cash flows as the purchases are funded from cash flows associated with the origination of insurance and investment contracts, net of payments of related benefits and claims.\n\n## (Z) Leases\n\nWhere the Group is the lessee, a lease liability equal to the present value of outstanding lease payments and a corresponding right-ofuse asset equal to cost are initially recognised. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at amortised cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the length of the lease term. Depreciation on lease assets and interest on lease liabilities is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe Group has made use of the election available under IFRS 16 to not recognise any amounts on the balance sheet associated with leases that are either deemed to be short-term, or where the underlying asset is of low value. A short-term lease in this context is defined as any arrangement which has a lease term of 12 months or less. Lease payments associated with such arrangements are recognised in the income statement as an expense on a straightline basis. The Group's total short-term and low value lease portfolio is not material.\n\nWhere the Group is the lessor, leases are classified as finance leases if the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the lessee and operating leases if they are not substantially transferred. Lease income from operating leases is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When assets are subject to finance leases, the present value of the lease payments, together with any unguaranteed residual value, is recognised as a receivable.\n\n## (AA) Provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is more probable than not that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.\n\nThe Group recognises provisions under a variety of circumstances including for product governance rectification, which may include customer redress, and for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\nThe amount recorded as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. Discounting is applied to the provision where the effect of the time value of money is material. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan and has raised a valid expectation that the restructure will be carried out, for example by announcing its main features to those affected. Costs included in restructuring provisions comprise only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring. Costs associated with the ongoing activities of the entity are excluded.\n\nWhere the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is only recognised as a separate asset when virtually certain.\n\nContingent liabilities are disclosed if there is a possible future obligation as a result of a past event, or if there is a present obligation as a result of a past event but either a payment is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## (AB) Employee benefits\n\n## Pension obligations\n\nThe Group operates a number of pension schemes, whose members receive benefits on either a defined benefit or defined contribution basis. Under a defined contribution plan, the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to the amount it agrees to contribute to a fund and there is no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay benefits. A defined benefit pension plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan and typically defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The pension obligation is measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows, using a discount rate based on market yields for high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. The resultant net surplus or deficit recognised as an asset or liability on the statement of financial position is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.\n\nPlan assets exclude unpaid contributions due from Group entities to the schemes, and any non-transferrable financial instruments issued by a Group entity and held by the schemes. If the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the resultant asset is limited to the asset ceiling defined as present value of economic benefits available in the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in contributions to the plan. In order to calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any minimum funding requirements that apply to any plan in the Group.\n\nRemeasurements of defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, the return on plan assets (excluding net interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any). The Group recognises remeasurements immediately in other comprehensive income and does not reclassify them to the income statement in subsequent periods.\n\nService costs comprising current service costs, past service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and net interest expense/income are charged or credited to the income statement.\n\nPast service costs are recognised at the earlier of the date the plan amendment or curtailment occurs or when related restructuring costs are recognised.\n\nThe Group determines the net interest expense/income on the net defined benefit liability/asset for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the net defined benefit liability/asset. Net interest expense is charged to finance costs, whereas, net interest income is credited to investment income.\n\nThe Group pays contributions to the defined contribution pension plans. Once the contributions have been paid, the Group, as employer, has no further payment obligations. The Group's contributions are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate and are included in staff costs.\n\n## Equity compensation plans\n\nThe Group offers share award and option plans over the Company's ordinary shares for certain employees, including a Save As You Earn plan (SAYE plan), details of which are given in the Directors' Remuneration Report and in note 33.\n\nThe Group accounts for options and awards under equity compensation plans, which were granted after 7 November 2002, until such time as they are fully vested, using the fair value based method of accounting (the 'fair value method'). Under this method, the cost of providing equity compensation plans is based on the fair value of the share awards or option plans at date of grant, which is recognised in the income statement over the expected vesting period of the related employees and credited to the equity compensation reserve, part of shareholders' funds. In certain jurisdictions, awards must be settled in cash instead of shares, and the credit is taken to liabilities rather than reserves.\n\nThe fair value of these cash-settled awards is recalculated each year, with the income statement charge and liability being adjusted accordingly.\n\nShares purchased by employee share trusts to fund these awards are shown as deduction from shareholders' equity at their weighted average cost.\n\nWhen the options are exercised and new shares are issued, the proceeds received, net of any transaction costs, are credited to share capital (par value) and the balance to share premium. Where the shares are already held by employee trusts, the net proceeds are credited against the cost of these shares, with the difference between cost and proceeds being taken to retained earnings. In both cases, the relevant amount in the equity compensation reserve is then credited to retained earnings.\n\n## (AC) Income taxes\n\nThe current tax expense is based on the taxable profits for the year, after any adjustments in respect of prior years. Tax, including tax relief for losses if applicable, is allocated over profits before taxation and amounts charged or credited to components of other comprehensive income and equity, as appropriate.\n\nProvision is made for deferred tax liabilities, or credit taken for deferred tax assets, using the liability method, on all material temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe rates enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date are used to value the deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on any temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nDeferred taxes are not provided in respect of temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax relating to items recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity are similarly recognised in other comprehensive income and directly in equity respectively.\n\nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of available for sale investments, pensions and other post-retirement obligations and other amounts charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of financial position as a deferred tax asset or liability. Current tax on interest paid on subordinated debt instruments is credited to the income statement.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax includes amounts provided in respect of uncertain tax positions, where management expects it is more likely than not that an economic outflow will occur as a result of examination by a relevant tax authority.\n\nProvisions reflect management's best estimate of the ultimate liability based on their interpretation of tax law, precedent and guidance, informed by external tax advice as necessary. The final amounts of tax due may ultimately differ from management's best estimate at the balance sheet date. Changes in facts and circumstances underlying these provisions are reassessed at each balance sheet date, and the provisions are re-measured as required to reflect current information.\n\nIn addition to paying tax on shareholders' profits ('shareholder tax'), the Group's life businesses in the UK, Ireland and Singapore pay tax on policyholders' investment returns ('policyholder tax') on certain products at policyholder tax rates. The incremental tax borne by the Group represents income tax on policyholder's investment return. In jurisdictions where policyholder tax is applicable, the total tax charge in the income statement is allocated between shareholder tax and policyholder tax. The shareholder tax is calculated by applying the corporate tax rate to the shareholder profit. The difference between the total tax charge and shareholder tax is allocated to policyholder tax. This calculation methodology is consistent with the legislation relating to the calculation of tax on shareholder profits. The Group has decided to show separately the amounts of policyholder tax to provide a meaningful measure of the tax the Group pays on its profit. In the reconciliation, the Group adjusted operating profit has been calculated after charging policyholder tax.\n\n## (AD) Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are classified as being for either core structural or operational purposes. They are recognised initially at their issue proceeds less transaction costs incurred. Subsequently, most borrowings are stated at amortised cost, and any difference between net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as they are incurred except where they are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of property and equipment as described in accounting policy P.\n\nWhere loan notes have been issued in connection with certain securitised mortgage loans, the Group has taken advantage of the fair value option under IAS 39 to present the mortgages, associated liabilities and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis. This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise from using different measurement bases for these three items.\n\n## (AE) Share capital and treasury shares Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities.\n\nAccordingly, a financial instrument is treated as equity if:\n\n- (i) there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on terms that may be unfavourable; and\n- (ii)  the instrument is a non-derivative that contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of shares or is a derivative that will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other assets for a fixed number of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## Share issue costs\n\nIncremental external costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds of the issue and disclosed where material.\n\n## Dividends\n\nInterim dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid. Final dividends on these shares are recognised when they have been approved by shareholders. Dividends on preference shares are recognised in the period in which they are declared and appropriately approved.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nWhere the Company or its subsidiaries purchase the Company's share capital or obtain rights to purchase its share capital, the consideration paid (including any attributable transaction costs net of income taxes) is shown as a deduction from total shareholders' equity. Gains and losses on own shares are charged or credited to the treasury share account in equity.\n\n## (AF) Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets and income arising from fiduciary activities, together with related undertakings to return such assets to customers, are excluded from these financial statements where the Group has no contractual rights in the assets and acts in a fiduciary capacity such as nominee, trustee or agent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Details are given in note 13.\n\nFor the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as convertible debt and share options granted to employees. No adjustments are made if the impact of the conversion of potential ordinary shares is antidilutive, which would decrease loss per share.\n\nPotential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.\n\n## (AH) Discontinued operations\n\nDiscontinued operations comprise those activities that were disposed of or classified as held for sale at the end of the period and represent a separate major line of business or geographical area that can clearly be distinguished for operational and financial reporting purposes.\n\nThe results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated income statement, disaggregated between the profit on disposal of discontinued operations and profit from discontinued operations.

Cash flows from operating activities include interest received of \u00a34,335 million (2021: \u00a33,605 million) and dividends received of \u00a34,347 million (2021: \u00a34,461 million). Cash flows from operating activities include impacts from the investment of proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations into financial investments during 2021, and subsequent disinvestment from those financial investments in 2022 ahead of the return of capital to ordinary shareholders. This activity is reflected as an increase in cash generated from operating activities in 2022.\n- 2. Acquisitions of, and additions to, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates net of cash acquired relates to the acquisition of Succession Wealth and Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited (see note 2a)\n- 3. Repayment of borrowings includes the redemption of \u00a31,002 million (2021: \u00a31,878 million) subordinated debt and senior notes (see note 51(e))\n- 4. On 15 June 2022, the Group issued \u00a3500 million of 6.875% fixed rate reset perpetual restricted tier 1 contingent convertible notes (the RT1 notes). The RT1 notes are callable at par between 15 December 2031 and 15 June 2032 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and thereafter every five years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 15 June 2032 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 4.649%. The notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the Group and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The RT1 notes are therefore treated as equity and the coupon payment is recognised directly in equity. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Group.\n\nThe above consolidated statement of cash flows should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies and accompanying notes to the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The acquisition significantly enhances our position in the fastgrowing UK wealth market and accelerates our ability to offer high-quality financial advice to our workplace and individual pension and savings customers.\n\nOf the total consideration of \u00a3392 million (including contingent consideration of \u00a37 million), \u00a3139 million of the cash transferred to the shareholders of Succession Wealth was used to settle Succession Wealth's existing external debt. The remaining \u00a3253 million represents the consideration paid to acquire \u00a371 million of net liabilities of Succession Wealth offset by \u00a3324 million of goodwill recognised on acquisition, as follows:\n\n|                                              | Fair Value \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Assets                                       |                 |\n| Intangible assets                            | 191             |\n| Other assets                                 | 12              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                    | 6               |\n| Total identifiable assets                    | 209             |\n| Liabilities                                  |                 |\n| Borrowings                                   | 139             |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                     | 48              |\n| Other liabilities                            | 93              |\n| Total identifiable liabilities               | 280             |\n| Net identifiable liabilities acquired        | (71)            |\n| Goodwill arising on acquisition              | 324             |\n| Consideration paid for net liabilities       | 246             |\n| Contingent consideration                     | 7               |\n| Total consideration paid for net liabilities | 253             |\n| Borrowings settlement                        | 139             |\n| Total Consideration                          | 392             |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 2 - Strategic transactions continued\n\nAn intangible asset of \u00a3191 million was recognised upon acquisition representing the value attributable to the existing business from Succession Wealth's existing customer base. This will be amortised over its estimated useful life in accordance with the Group's accounting policies along with the corresponding release of the deferred tax provision. The residual goodwill on acquisition of \u00a3324 million, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, represents future synergies expected to arise from combining the operations of Succession Wealth with those of the Group as well as the value of the workforce in place and other future business value.\n\nIn the period from 11 August 2022 to 31 December 2022 the acquired Succession Wealth subsidiaries contributed net income of \u00a335 million and a profit before tax of \u00a33 million to the consolidated results of the Group. If the acquisition had been effective on 1 January 2022, on a pro-forma basis the Group's net income is estimated at \u00a384 million and loss before tax is estimated at \u00a340 million. These pro-forma results are provided for information purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2022, nor are they necessarily indicative of the future results of the combined Group. Acquisition costs of \u00a37 million related to legal and professional fees incurred to support the transaction have been recognised within other expenses in the income statement.\n\n## Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited (\"Aviva India\")\n\nOn 28 September 2022 the Group acquired an additional 25% of the ordinary share capital of Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited ('Aviva India') for cash consideration of \u00a337 million, increasing the Group's total shareholding from 49% to 74% and giving Aviva a controlling interest in the entity. On that date, Aviva derecognised its investment in associate and recognised Aviva India as a consolidated subsidiary.\n\nImmediately prior to the acquisition, Aviva's 49% interest in Aviva India was remeasured to its fair value of \u00a373 million, resulting in a reversal of historic impairment of \u00a315 million, recognised within share of profit/(loss) after tax from joint ventures and associates in the income statement. The investment in associate was subsequently derecognised at its revalued amount.\n\nThe following table summarises the consideration for the acquisition, the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and resulting allocation to goodwill. The opening balance sheet of Aviva India was recorded at the prevailing rate of exchange on the date of acquisition.\n\n|                                                           | Fair Value \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Assets                                                    |                 |\n| Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets | 228             |\n| Financial investments                                     | 1,297           |\n| Other Assets                                              | 47              |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                 | 2               |\n| Total identifiable assets                                 | 1,574           |\n| Liabilities                                               |                 |\n| Gross insurance liabilities                               | 1,240           |\n| Payables and other financial liabilities                  | 30              |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                  | 32              |\n| Other liabilities                                         | 19              |\n| Total identifiable liabilities                            | 1,321           |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                          | 253             |\n| Non-controlling interests                                 | (66)            |\n| Shareholder equity retained by the Group                  | 187             |\n| Cash consideration                                        | 37              |\n| Fair value of existing investment in Aviva India          | 73              |\n| Negative goodwill                                         | 77              |\n\nAn asset of \u00a3228 million in respect of AVIF was recognised upon acquisition representing the margins in Aviva India's statutory reserves of the in-force business. The acquisition resulted in a gain from negative goodwill of \u00a377 million, as the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the total value of the cash consideration and the fair value of the previous investment in associate. The gain has been recognised immediately in the income statement as required by IFRS 3 Business combinations.\n\nIn the period from 30 September 2022 to 31 December 2022 the acquired Aviva India business contributed net income of \u00a362 million and a profit before tax of \u00a36 million to the consolidated results of the Group.

Other in 2022 primarily includes \u00a377 million negative goodwill on the Aviva India acquisition partially offset by \u00a315 million charge associated with reinsurance accepted from former Aviva France general insurance entity and charges in relation to our historic divestments, share buybacks and acquisitions in the period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group adjusted operating profit includes the effect of variances in experience for operating items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in operating assumptions. Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit, in investment variances and economic assumption changes.\n\n## (b) Methodology\n\nThe expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in life business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal life business unit.\n\nThe expected return on investments for both policyholders' and shareholders' funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period. Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year. The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equity and property. Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.\n\nThe actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as well as other market movements. To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the life business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the Group adjusted operating profit. The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside Group adjusted operating profit but included in profit before tax attributable to shareholders' profits.\n\nThe movement in liabilities included in Group adjusted operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments, and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items. This would include movements in liabilities due to changes in the discount rate arising from discretionary management decisions that impact on product profitability over the lifetime of products.\n\nThe effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside Group adjusted operating profit. For many types of life business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit. The profit impact of economic volatility on other life business depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 7 - Life business investment variances and economic assumption changes continued\n\n## (c) Assumptions\n\nThe expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions at the start of the period between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equity and property are:\n\n|                | 2022   | Equity 2021   | 2022   | Property 2021   |\n|----------------|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| United Kingdom | 4.4%   | 3.9%          | 2.9%   | 2.4%            |\n| Ireland        | 3.8%   | 3.2%          | 2.3%   | 1.7%            |\n\nThe expected return on equity and property has been calculated by reference to the ten-year mid-price swap rate for an AA rated bank in the relevant currency plus a risk premium. The use of risk premium reflects management's long-term expectations of asset return in excess of the swap yield from investing in different asset classes. The asset risk premia are set out in the table below:\n\n| All territories       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity risk premium   | 3.5%   | 3.5%   |\n| Property risk premium | 2.0%   | 2.0%   |\n\nThe ten-year mid-price swap rates at the start of the period are set out in the table below:\n\n| Territories    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| United Kingdom | 0.9%   | 0.4%   |\n| Ireland        | 0.3%   | (0.3%) |\n\nFor fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk (assessed on a best estimate basis). This includes an adjustment for credit risk on all eurozone sovereign debt. Where such securities are classified as available for sale, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.\n\n## (d) Investment variances and economic assumption changes\n\nThe investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the life adjusted operating profit are as follows:\n\n|                                               | 2022    | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Life business                                 | \u00a3m      | \u00a3m     |\n| Investment variances and economic assumptions | (2,387) | (805)  |\n\nThe loss of \u00a32,387 million (2021: loss of \u00a3805 million) in relation to investment variances and economic assumption changes was primarily driven by the significant increase in UK interest rates, with the rate on 10-year swaps increasing by 280bps during 2022. This resulted in a reduction in the value of fixed income securities and loans (see notes 23 and 26) which was not fully offset by a reduction in the valuation of long-term insurance liabilities from the increase in the valuation interest rate (see note 46). Other components of investment variances and economic assumption changes were smaller and broadly offset. These include positive impacts from hedging negative global equity returns and a reduction in the allowance for risk of default on assets backing annuities due to reduced asset values; and negative impacts from foreign exchange losses and widening of spreads on corporate bonds.\n\nThe adverse impact of interest rate rises and the beneficial impact from equity falls reflect the fact that we hedge on a Solvency II basis as that drives the ability of markets to remit cash, rather than an IFRS basis. For example, when equity markets increase we gain from the increase in the value of future annual management charges on unit-linked products on an economic basis which are not recognised under IFRS, however, the loss from hedges in place is recognised on both Solvency II and IFRS bases.\n\nFurther information on the sensitivity of the Group's long-term business to economic factors is provided in note 58(h)(iv).\n\nThe negative variance for 2021 was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates and positive global equity returns, partially offset by narrowing of credit spreads.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In respect of equities and investment properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the long-term rate of investment return.\n\nThe long-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return. The allocated long-term return for other investments (including debt securities) is the actual income receivable for the year. Actual income and long-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts/premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities. For other operations, the long-term return reflects assets backing non-life business held in Group centre investments.\n\nMarket value movements which give rise to variances between actual and long-term investment returns are disclosed separately in shortterm fluctuations outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe impact of realised and unrealised gains and losses on Group centre investments is included in short-term fluctuations on other operations.\n\n## (c) Assumptions\n\nThe principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the long-term investment return are:\n\n|                | Long-term rates  of return on equities   | Long-term rates  of return on equities   | Long-term rates  of return on property   | Long-term rates  of return on property   |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                | 2022                                     | 2021                                     | 2022                                     | 2021                                     |\n| United Kingdom | 4.4%                                     | 3.9%                                     | 2.9%                                     | 2.4%                                     |\n| Ireland        | 3.8%                                     | 3.2%                                     | 2.3%                                     | 1.7%                                     |\n| Canada         | 5.5%                                     | 4.7%                                     | 4.0%                                     | 3.2%                                     |\n\nThe long-term rates of return on equities and properties have been calculated by reference to the ten-year mid-price swap rate for an AA rated bank in the relevant currency plus a risk premium.

The increase in interest rates resulted in a reduction in the value of fixed income securities (see note 26). Additionally there were further losses from equity market falls, foreign exchange losses and credit spreads widening.\n\nThe short-term fluctuations during 2021 were primarily due to rising interest rates reducing the value of fixed income securities, partially offset by foreign exchange gains.\n\nFurther information on the sensitivity of the general insurance and health business to economic factors is provided in note 58(h)(iv).\n\n## (e) Economic assumption changes\n\nIn the general insurance and health business, there is a beneficial impact of \u00a3147 million (2021: loss of \u00a385 million) which has arisen primarily as a result of a material increase in the interest rates used to discount claims reserves for periodic payment orders (PPOs) and latent claims.\n\nAs explained in accounting policy L, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims. The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected outside Group adjusted operating profit as an economic assumption change. The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 42.\n\n## 9 - Employee information\n\nThis  note  shows  where  our  staff  are  employed,  excluding  staff  employed  by  our  joint  ventures  and  associates,  and  analyses  the  total staff costs.\n\n## (a) Employee numbers\n\nThe number of persons employed by the Group, including directors under a service contract, was:\n\n|                                      | At 31 December   | At 31 December   | Average for the year 1   | Average for the year 1   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                      | 2022 Number      | 2021 Number      | 2022 Number              | 2021 Number              |\n| Continuing operations                |                  |                  |                          |                          |\n| UK & Ireland Life                    | 9,163            | 8,629            | 8,717                    | 8,687                    |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance       | 7,858            | 7,521            | 7,680                    | 7,781                    |\n| Canada                               | 4,471            | 4,321            | 4,439                    | 4,219                    |\n| Aviva Investors                      | 997              | 1,118            | 1,069                    | 1,118                    |\n| International investments            | 1,334            | -                | 1,294                    | -                        |\n| Other Group activities               | 541              | 473              | 502                      | 507                      |\n| Employees in continuing operations   | 24,364           | 22,062           | 23,701                   | 22,312                   |\n| Employees in discontinued operations | -                | -                | -                        | 5,151                    |\n| Total employee numbers               | 24,364           | 22,062           | 23,701                   | 27,463                   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profits and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Group's pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge/(credit) attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge.\n\nThe UK Government has enacted an increase in the UK corporation tax rate to 25% to take effect from 1 April 2023. This rate has been used in the calculation of the UK's deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022 and increased the Group's deferred tax liabilities by \u00a3235 million in the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nOn 20 July 2022 the UK government published draft legislation for consultation on The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development proposals to reform the international tax system and introduce a global minimum rate of corporation tax. Final legislation is expected to be enacted in 2023. The proposals are complex and there remains considerable uncertainty about the final form of the rules and the accompanying guidance in all countries. Accordingly, the potential impact cannot yet be reliably estimated. The proposed minimum tax rate of 15% is significantly below the statutory corporation tax rates in the UK and Canada. The Group continues to monitor the progress of proposed legislation.\n\n## (e) Tax paid reconciliation\n\nThe tax on the Group's loss/profit before tax differs from the tax paid per the consolidated statement of cash flows as follows:\n\n|                                                                                      | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total tax (credited)/charged to income statement from continuing operations          | (1,240)   | 465       |\n| Accounts adjustments                                                                 |           |           |\n| Deferred tax                                                                         | 1,294     | (204)     |\n| Prior period adjustments                                                             | 35        | (33)      |\n| Current tax recorded in other comprehensive income                                   | (6)       | (10)      |\n|                                                                                      | 1,323     | (247)     |\n| Payment timing differences Current year tax to be repaid in later accounting periods | 131       | 31        |\n| Current year tax (repaid)/paid relating to prior accounting periods                  | (4)       | 55        |\n|                                                                                      | 127       | 86        |\n| Tax paid by continuing operations                                                    | 210       | 304       |\n| Tax paid by discontinued operations                                                  | -         | 79        |\n| Total tax paid                                                                       | 210       | 383       |\n\nDeferred tax represents the tax on profits or losses, which are required by legislation to be taxed in a different period to which they impact the Group's financial statements.\n\nPrior period adjustments arise where the final tax liability payable to tax authorities is different from the tax charge for the period reported in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consideration of both these measures gives a full picture of the performance of the business during the year.\n\n## (a) Basic earnings per share\n\n- (i)   The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is:\n\n|                                                                                 | 2022                               | 2022               | 2022     | 2021                               | 2021               | 2021     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------|\n|                                                                                 | Group adjusted operating profit \u00a3m | Adjusting items \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Group adjusted operating profit \u00a3m | Adjusting items \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Continuing operations                                                           |                                    |                    |          |                                    |                    |          |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to shareholders' profits                  | 2,213                              | (3,818)            | (1,605)  | 1,634                              | (1,078)            | 556      |\n| Tax attributable to shareholders' profits                                       | (289)                              | 755                | 466      | (330)                              | 110                | (220)    |\n| Profit/(loss) from continuing operations                                        | 1,924                              | (3,063)            | (1,139)  | 1,304                              | (968)              | 336      |\n| Amount attributable to non-controlling interests                                | (21)                               | -

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the CGU unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Long-term business\n\nValue in use has been calculated based on a shareholder value of the business calculated in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders' interests. The principal adjustments relate to the exclusion of the benefit of transitional measures on technical provisions and the volatility adjustment under Solvency II, modification of the Solvency II risk margin to an economic view and removal of restrictions on contract boundaries or business scope.\n\nThe present value of expected profits arising from future new business may be included within the shareholder value and is calculated on an adjusted Solvency II basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management. These plans reflect management's best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit. The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.\n\nFuture new business profits beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate. Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.\n\nExpected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate. The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Economic assumptions are based on market data as at the end of each reporting period. The basic risk-free rate curves used to value the technical provisions reflect the curves, credit risk adjustment and fundamental spread for the matching adjustment published by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the Bank of England on their websites. For the purposes of calculating value in use, the Solvency II risk margin has been modified to an economic view, with a cost of capital rate of 2%.\n\n## General insurance, health, fund management and other businesses\n\nValue in use is calculated as the discounted value of expected future profits of each business. The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three-year period. These plans reflect management's best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash generating unit. The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.\n\nCash flows beyond that three-year period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate. Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to past experience and relevant available market statistics.\n\nFuture profits are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate which is based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The inputs include the risk-free rate of interest appropriate to the geographic location of the cash flows related to each CGU being tested, market risk premium, beta and other adjustments to factor local market risks and risks specific to each CGU.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\n|                                             | Extrapolated future  profits growth rate   | Extrapolated future  profits growth rate   | Future profits  discount rate   | Future profits  discount rate   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                             | 2022 %                                     | 2021 %                                     | 2022  (Pre-tax) %               | 2021  (Pre-tax) %               |\n| United Kingdom general insurance and health | 1.0                                        | 1.0                                        | 12.4                            | 8.8                             |\n| Ireland general insurance and health        | Nil                                        | Nil                                        | 9.6                             | 8.9                             |\n| Canada general insurance                    | 5.0                                        | 5.0                                        | 10.8                            | 10.6                            |\n\n## Results of impairment testing\n\nManagement's impairment review of the Group's cash generating units did not identify any necessary impairments to goodwill.

On insurance and participating investment contracts\n- 2. On non-participating investment contracts\n- 3. Disposals in 2021 relate to the disposals of Aviva France, Aviva Italy, Aviva Poland and Aviva Vietnam\n- 4. Amortisation of other intangible assets with finite useful lives includes \u00a354 million (2021: \u00a366 million) of amortisation in respect of intangible assets acquired in business combinations\n\n## (a) Acquired value of in-force business\n\nAVIF on insurance and investment contracts is generally recoverable in more than one year. Of the total of \u00a31,581 million, \u00a31,443 million (2021: \u00a31,357 million) is expected to be recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.\n\nNon-participating investment contract AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment, consistent with reviews conducted for other finite life intangible assets. Insurance and participating investment contract AVIF is reviewed for impairment at each reporting date as part of the liability adequacy requirements in IFRS 4. AVIF is reviewed for evidence of impairment and impairment tested at product portfolio level by reference to the value of future profits in accordance with Solvency II principles, adjusted where Solvency II does not represent a best estimate of shareholders' interests, consistent with the impairment test for goodwill for long-term business (see note 15(b)).\n\nAdditions of \u00a3228 million relate to AVIF recognised upon acquisition of Aviva India (see note 2(a)). There were no impairments in 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil) in relation to the AVIF on insurance contracts or investment contracts.\n\n## (b) Other intangible assets with finite useful lives\n\nOther intangible assets with finite useful lives consist mainly of the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements and capitalised software. Additions of intangible assets with finite lives in 2022 relate to an intangible attributable to the existing business of Succession Wealth acquired on 11 August 2022 (see note 2(a)) and capitalisation of software costs in relation to the Group's digital initiatives. Impairments totalling \u00a34 million (2021: \u00a33 million) have been recognised in 2022 in relation to capitalised software.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill or intangible relates to the recoverable value of that cash generating unit. Recoverable amounts for long-term and general insurance businesses are calculated on a consistent basis with that used for impairment testing of goodwill, as set out in note 15(b). The recoverable amount of property management undertakings is the fair value less costs to sell off the joint venture, measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for investment property (see accounting policy Q).\n\n## 18 - Interests in, and loans to, associates\n\nThis note analyses our interests in entities which we do not control but where we have significant influence.\n\n## (a) Carrying amount and details of associates\n\n- (i) The movements in the carrying amount comprised:\n\n|                                    | 2022 Equity  interests \u00a3m   | 2021 Equity   interests \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| At 1 January                       | 118                         | 263                          |\n| Share of results before tax        | (11)                        | (22)                         |\n| Share of tax                       | -                           | -                            |\n| Share of results after tax         | (11)                        | (22)                         |\n| Impairment                         | (23)                        | -                            |\n| Reversal of impairment             | 15                          | -                            |\n| Share of loss after tax            | (19)                        | (22)                         |\n| Reclassification to subsidiary     | (73)                        | -                            |\n| Additions                          | 7                           | -                            |\n| Disposals                          | -                           | (77)                         |\n| Reduction in group interest        | (1)                         | (5)                          |\n| Reclassification to investment     | -                           | -                            |\n| Dividends received from associates | (1)                         | (36)                         |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements    | 10                          | (5)                          |\n| At 31 December                     | 41                          | 118                          |\n\nOn 28 September 2022 the Group acquired an additional 25% of the ordinary share capital of Aviva India (see note 2(a)), increasing the Group's total shareholding from 49% to 74% giving Aviva a controlling interest in the entity. On that date, Aviva derecognised its investment in associate and recognised Aviva India as a consolidated subsidiary. Immediately prior to the acquisition, the fair value of Aviva's 49% interest in Aviva India was \u00a373 million. The investment was remeasured to fair value in accordance with IFRS 3 Business combinations, resulting in a reversal of historic impairment of \u00a315 million. The investment in associate was subsequently derecognised at its revalued amount.\n\nDisposals of \u00a377 million in 2021 relate to the Group's interest in SCPI Ufifrance Immobilier and SCPI Logipierre 1 which were disposed of as part of the disposal of Aviva France (see note 2(b)).\n\nThe Group's share of total comprehensive income related to associates is \u00a3(19) million (2021: \u00a3(22) million).\n\n- (ii)  No associates are considered to be material from a Group perspective (2021: none). All investments in principal associates are held by subsidiaries. The Group's principal associates are as follows:\n\n|                                            |                      |                             | Proportion of  ownership interest   | Proportion of  ownership interest   |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Name                                       | Nature of activities | Principal place of business | 2022                                | 2021                                |\n| Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited | Life insurance       | India                       | -                                   | 49.00%                              |\n| AI UK Commercial Real Estate Debt Fund     | Property Management  | UK                          | 20.86%                              | 20.90%                              |\n\nIn certain jurisdictions the ability of associates to transfer funds in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans and advances made by the Group is subject to local corporate or insurance laws and regulations and solvency requirements.\n\n## (b) Impairment testing\n\nThe recoverable amount of property management undertakings is the fair value less costs to sell off the associate, measured in accordance with the Group's accounting policy for investment property (see accounting policy Q). An impairment charge of \u00a323 million (2021: \u00a3nil) has been recognised in the income statement and primarily relates to the full impairment of an investment held by the UK & Ireland Life business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, property and equipment of \u00a3157 million was disposed of as part of the disposal of operations in France and Poland\n\nOwner-occupied properties, excluding \u00a3230 million (2021: \u00a3294 million) held under lease arrangements, are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers. The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nOwner-occupied properties held under lease arrangements are stated at amortised cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless the carrying value of the leased asset exceeds the recoverable amount. Where this is the case, the asset is impaired to its recoverable amount and the impaired carrying value is amortised on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the lease term. For further information on the Group's lease arrangements see note 21.\n\nIf owner-occupied properties (freehold and leasehold) were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be \u00a3134 million (2021: \u00a3184 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, Investment property of \u00a35,155 million was disposed of as part of the disposal of Aviva France\n\nSee note 22 for further information on the fair value measurement and valuation techniques of investment property.\n\nThe fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2022 was \u00a35,676 million (2021: \u00a36,712 million). Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 21.\n\n## 21 - Lease assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group's leased assets primarily consist of properties occupied by Group companies carried at amortised cost (see note 19), leasehold investment properties carried at fair value (see note 20) which are sublet to third parties and real estate long income finance leases (see note 27). Leasehold investment properties are measured in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property (see accounting policy Q).\n\nAlthough the Group is exposed to changes in the residual value at the end of the current leases to third parties on investment property, the Group typically enters into new operating leases and therefore is not expected to immediately realise any reduction in residual value at the end of these leases. Expectations about the future residual values are reflected in the fair value of the properties.\n\n- (i) The following amounts in respect of leased assets have been recognised in the Group's consolidated income statement.\n\n|                                                         |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                   |         9 |        11 |\n| Total lease expenses recognised in the income statement |         9 |        11 |\n\nTotal cash outflows recognised in the period in relation to leases were \u00a363 million (2021: \u00a371 million). Expenses recognised in the Group consolidated income statement in relation to short-term and low-value leases were \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil). Variable lease payments not included in the measurement of lease liabilities were \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n- (ii) The following table analyses the right-of-use assets relating to leased properties occupied by Group companies.\n\n|                                     | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Balance at 1 January                | 294       | 338       |\n| Additions                           | 6         | 74        |\n| Disposals                           | (1)       | (56)      |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements     | -         | (4)       |\n| Impairment of right-of-use assets   | -         | (6)       |\n| Depreciation                        | (33)      | (52)      |\n| Modification of right-of-use assets | (36)      | -         |\n| Balance at 31 December              | 230       | 294       |\n\nThere were no gains arising from sale and leaseback transactions during the year. Included within the income statement is \u00a33 million (2021: \u00a33 million) of income in respect of sublets of right-of-use assets. There was no impairment of right-of-use assets in 2022. In 2021, \u00a37 million impairment arose from the reduction in the Group's property footprint.\n\n- (iii) Lease liabilities included within note 52 total \u00a3386 million (2021: \u00a3472 million). Future contractual aggregate minimum lease payments are as follows:\n\n|                                              |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within 1 year                                |        70 |        67 |\n| Later than 1 year and not later than 5 years |       196 |       187 |\n| Later than 5 years                           |       165 |       182 |\n|                                              |       431 |       436 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Unguaranteed residual value in respect of finance leases was \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n## 22 - Fair value methodology\n\nThis note explains the methodology for valuing our assets and liabilities measured at fair value and for fair value disclosures. It also provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.\n\n## (a) Basis for determining fair value hierarchy\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole.\n\n## Level 1\n\nInputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date. Level 1 inputs already reflect market participant views of climate change impacts and no further adjustments are made to these values.\n\n## Level 2\n\nInputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument. Level 2 inputs include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets;\n- \u00b7 Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly;\n- \u00b7 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, implied volatilities and credit spreads); and\n- \u00b7 Market corroborated inputs.\n\nWhere we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, the investments are classified as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the broker price is validated by using internal models with market observable inputs and the values are similar, we classify the investment as Level 2; and\n- \u00b7 In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, or the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 22 - Fair value methodology continued\n\n## Level 3\n\nInputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. However, the fair value measurement objective remains the same, i.e. an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Examples are investment properties and commercial and equity release mortgage loans.\n\nThe majority of the Group's assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on quoted market information or observable market data. Of the total assets and liabilities measured at fair value 15.9% (2021: 15.7%) of assets and 0.9% (2021: 0.9%) of liabilities are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3. Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible. Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value. Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2.\n\n## (b) Changes to valuation techniques\n\nThere were no changes in the valuation techniques during the year compared to those described in the Group's 2021 Annual Report and Accounts.\n\n## (c) Comparison of the carrying amount and fair values of financial instruments\n\nSet out below is a comparison of the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and liabilities, excluding those classified as held for sale. These amounts may differ where the assets or liabilities are carried on a measurement basis other than fair value, e.g. amortised cost.\n\n|                                                    | 2022          | 2022                | 2021          | 2021                |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|\n|                                                    | Fair value \u00a3m | Carrying  amount \u00a3m | Fair value \u00a3m | Carrying  amount \u00a3m |\n| Financial assets                                   |               |                     |               |                     |\n| Loans (note 23(a)) 1                               | 29,646        | 29,647              | 38,622        | 38,624              |\n| Financial investments (note 26(a))                 | 224,086       | 224,086             | 264,961       | 264,961             |\n| Fixed maturity securities                          | 103,776       | 103,776             | 133,251       | 133,251             |\n| Equity securities                                  | 85,790        | 85,790              | 95,169        | 95,169              |\n| Other investments (including derivatives)          | 34,520        | 34,520              | 36,541        | 36,541              |\n| Financial liabilities                              |               |                     |               |                     |\n| Non-participating investment contract (note 43(a)) | 140,990       | 140,990             | 151,115       | 151,115             |\n| Net asset value attributable to unitholders        | 14,080        | 14,080              | 16,427        | 16,427              |\n| Borrowings (note 51(a)) 1                          | 6,499         | 6,755               | 8,375         | 7,344               |\n| Derivative liabilities (note 59(b))                | 9,541         | 9,541               | 5,763         | 5,763               |\n\n- 1.

These valuations are determined using independent external quotations from multiple sources and are subject to a number of monitoring controls, such as monthly price variances, stale price reviews and variance analysis. Pricing services, where available, are used to obtain the third-party broker quotes. Where pricing services providers are used, a single valuation is obtained and applied. When prices are not available from pricing services, quotes are sourced from brokers.\n\nOver-the-counter derivatives are valued using broker quotes or models such as option pricing models, simulation models or a combination of models. The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.\n\nUnit Trusts and other investment funds (included under the other investments category) are valued using net asset values which are not subject to a significant adjustment for restrictions on redemption or for limited trading activity.\n\n## (f) Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy\n\nFor financial instruments that are recognised at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels of the fair value hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Transfers between Level 1 and Level 2\n\nThere were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 (2021: no significant transfers).\n\n## Transfers to/from Level 3\n\n\u00a3698 million (2021: \u00a3189 million) of assets transferred into Level 3 and \u00a3509 million (2021: \u00a31,370 million) of assets transferred out of Level 3 relate principally to fixed maturity securities held by our business in the UK. These are transferred between Levels 2 and 3 depending on the availability of observable inputs and whether the counterparty and broker quotes are corroborated using valuation models with observable inputs.\n\n\u00a3297 million (2021: \u00a3nil) of liabilities transferred into Level 3 relate to derivatives held by our business in the UK. These have been transferred into Level 3 following a change to using an internally-derived valuation model from the previous counterparty supplied valuations to ensure consistency of approach with the associated assets and liabilities held at fair value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total net gains/(losses) recognised in the income statement includes realised gains/(losses) on disposals\n\nTotal net losses recognised in the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2022 in respect of Level 3 assets measured at fair value amounted to \u00a310,106 million (2021: net losses of \u00a3760 million) with net gains in respect of liabilities of \u00a3258 million (2021: net gains of \u00a326 million). Net losses of \u00a310,203 million (2021: net losses of \u00a3852 million) attributable to assets and net gains of \u00a3258 million (2021: net losses of \u00a318 million) attributable to liabilities relate to those still held at the end of the year.\n\nThe principal assets classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are described below.\n\n## (i) Investment property\n\n- \u00b7 Investment property is valued in the UK at least annually by external chartered surveyors in accordance with guidance issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and using estimates during the intervening period. Outside the UK, valuations are produced by external qualified professional appraisers in the countries concerned. The Group's methodology requires external valuers in the UK to apply the 'Sustainability and ESG in commercial property valuation and strategic advice' guidance note issued by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in December 2021. In a valuation context, sustainability encompasses a wide range of physical, social, environmental, and economic factors that can affect value. The range of issues includes key environmental risks, such as flooding, energy efficiency and climate, as well as matters of design, configuration, accessibility, legislation, management and fiscal considerations.\n- \u00b7 Investment properties are valued on an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no further growth in the estimated rental value of the property. The uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The yield used to value investment property can vary significantly depending on a number of factors including location, type of property and sector. The yield used to value the portfolio ranges from 100bps to 2160bps (2021: 113bps to 2094bps) with higher yields predominately relating to properties in the retail and leisure sectors. Over 95% of the portfolio is valued using spreads within the range from 100bps to 810bps (2021: 113bps to 870bps).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 22 - Fair value methodology continued\n\n## (ii) Loans\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial mortgage loans and Primary Healthcare loans held by our UK Life business are valued using a Portfolio Credit Risk Model. This model calculates a Credit Risk Adjusted Value for each loan. The risk adjusted cash flows are discounted using a yield curve plus an allowance for illiquidity. Loans valued using the Portfolio Credit Risk Model have been classified as Level 3 as the liquidity premium is deemed to be non-market observable. At 31 December 2022 the liquidity premium used in the discount rate was 110 bps (2021: 150 bps). Future capital expenditure costs of 0.9% per annum (2021: 0.6%) are included in the modelling of the Credit Risk Adjusted Value of the loans to address climate change actions, including potential climate-related legislation changes. The impact is a reduction in the fair value of the properties securing the loans.\n- \u00b7 Equity release mortgage loans held by our UK Life business are valued using an internal model, with fair value initially being equal to the transaction price. The value of these loans is dependent on the expected term of the mortgage and the forecast property value at the end of the term and is calculated by adjusting future cash flows for credit risk and discounting using a yield curve plus an allowance for illiquidity. At 31 December 2022 the illiquidity premium used in the discount rate was 155 bps (2021: 180 bps).\n- \u00b7 The equity release mortgages have a no negative equity guarantee ('NNEG') such that the cost of any potential shortfall between the value of the loan and the realised value of the property at the end of the term is recognised by a deduction to the value of the loan. Property valuations at the reporting date are obtained by taking the most recent valuation for the property and indexing using an internal house price index based on published Land Registry data. NNEG is calculated using base property growth rates reduced for the cost of potential dilapidations, using a stochastic model. In addition, a cost of capital charge is applied to reflect the variability in these cash flows. The base property growth rate assumption is RPI +0.75% (2021: RPI +0.75%) which includes a reduction to the growth rate of 0.5% per annum for the potential impact of climate change actions. The modelled growth rates include an adjustment for the 5-year period 2023-2027 to reflect the market view of short-term growth being lower than long-term growth. The combination of the adjusted rate over the first five years and the base property growth rate equates to a long-term average growth rate of 3.1% per annum at 31 December 2022 (2021: 3.9%) over a twenty five year projection. After applying the cost of capital charge, dilapidations and the stochastic distribution, the effective net long-term growth rate equates to 0.4% per annum (2021: 0.6%).\n- \u00b7 Infrastructure and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) loans held by our UK Life business are valued using a discounted cash flow model. This adds spreads for credit and illiquidity to a risk-free discount rate. Credit spreads used in the discount rate are calculated using an internally developed methodology which depends on the credit rating of each loan, credit spreads on publicly traded bonds and an estimated recovery rate in event of default and are deemed to be unobservable. At 31 December 2022, the illiquidity premium used in the discount rate was 115bps (2021: 95bps) for the PFI loans and ranged from 25bps to 210bps (2021: 25bps to 210bps) for the infrastructure loans.\n\n## (iii) Fixed maturity securities\n\n- \u00b7 Structured bond-type, non-standard debt products and privately placed notes held by our life business in the UK do not trade in an active market. These fixed maturity securities are valued using discounted cash flow model, designed to appropriately reflect the credit and illiquidity risk of the instrument. These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because the valuation approach includes significant unobservable inputs and an element of subjectivity in determining appropriate credit and illiquidity spreads.\n- \u00b7 Other fixed maturity securities held by our life business in the UK which are not traded in an active market have been valued using thirdparty or counterparty valuations. These prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transaction.\n- \u00b7 The unobservable credit and illiquidity spreads used in the discount rate range from 25bps to 604bps (2021: 24bps to 822bps) with 99% of the modelled assets valued using spreads within the range from 25bps to 344bps (2021: 24bps to 297bps).\n\n## (iv) Equity securities\n\n- \u00b7 Equity securities which primarily comprise private equity holdings held in the UK are valued by a number of third-party specialists. These are valued using a range of techniques including earnings multiples, forecast cash flows and price/earnings ratios which are deemed to be unobservable.\n\n## (v) Other investments (including derivatives)\n\n- \u00b7 Other investments are held for index-linked, unit-linked and with-profit funds and are valued based on external valuation reports received from fund managers. The investments consist of:\n- - Unit trusts;\n- - Other Investment funds including property funds; and\n- - Derivatives.\n- \u00b7 Where valuations are at a date other than the balance sheet date, as is the case for private equity funds, adjustments are made for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions and the fund manager's carried interest.\n\n## (vi) Liabilities\n\n- \u00b7 The principal liabilities classified as Level 3 are securitised mortgage loan notes, presented within Borrowings, which are valued using a similar technique to the related Level 3 securitised mortgage assets. These liabilities are included within the relevant liability category within the sensitivity table below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 22 - Fair value methodology continued\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe valuation of level 3 assets involves a high degree of judgement and estimation uncertainty due to the reliance of valuation models on unobservable inputs. Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liabilities to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives. Level 3 valuations are sourced from independent third parties when available and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes. Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis:\n\n- \u00b7 For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally-modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.\n- \u00b7 For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input. Sensitivities are determined by flexing inputs of internal models to a reasonable alternative, including the yield, NAV multiple or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation. For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the security's contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.\n\nThe tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of Level 3 assets and liabilities to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative:\n\n|                                                           |                                                    |                        | Sensitivities Negative   | Sensitivities Negative   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 2022                                                      | Fair value \u00a3bn Most significant unobservable input | Reasonable alternative | Positive impact          | impact                   |\n|                                                           |                                                    | +/-5-10%               |                          |                          |\n| Commercial mortgage loans and Primary Healthcare          | Illiquidity premium                                |                        | 0.3                      |                          |\n|                                                           | 9.4                                                | +/-20 bps              | 0.1                      | (0.1)                    |\n| loans                                                     | Base property growth rate                          | +/-100 bps p.a.        | 0.1                      | (0.1)                    |\n| Equity release mortgage loans                             | 9.6  Base property growth rate                     | +/-40 bps p.a.         | 0.2                      | (0.2)                    |\n|                                                           | Current property market values                     | +/-10%                 | 0.2                      | (0.2)                    |\n| Infrastructure and Private Finance Initiative (PFI) loans | 5.3  Illiquidity premium                           | +/-25 bps 1            | 0.2                      | (0.2)                    |\n| Fixed maturity securities                                 |                                                    | +/-25 bps              | -                        | -                        |\n| Structured bond-type and non-standard debt products       | 0.4  Market spread (credit, liquidity and other)   | +/-25 bps              | -                        | -                        |\n| Privately placed notes                                    | 2.9  Credit spreads                                | +/-25 bps 1            | 0.1                      | (0.1)                    |\n|                                                           | 3.9                                                |                        | 0.1                      |                          |\n| Other fixed maturity securities                           | Credit and liquidity spreads                       | +/-20-25 bps           |                          | (0.1)                    |\n| Equity securities                                         | 0.3  Market multiples applied to net asset values  | +/-25%                 | 0.1                      | (0.1)                    |\n| Other investments                                         |                                                    |                        |                          |                          |\n| Property Funds                                            | 0.2  Market multiples applied to net asset values  | +/-15-20%              | \u00a3bn -                    | \u00a3bn -                    |\n| Liabilities                                               |                                                    |                        |                          |                          |\n| Other liabilities (including derivatives)                 | (0.4)  Independent valuation vs counterparty       | N/A                    | -                        | -  -                     |\n| Total Level 3 investments                                 |                                                    |                        | 1.5                      | (1.5)                    |\n|                                                           | 39.1                                               |                        |                          |                          |\n\n- 1.

Further details of the fair value methodology and models utilised are given in note 22 (g).\n\nThe cumulative change in fair value of loans attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2022 was a \u00a398 million loss (2021: \u00a3475 million loss).\n\nHealthcare, infrastructure and PFI other loans of \u00a36,837 million (2021: \u00a37,994 million) are secured against the income from healthcare and educational premises.\n\nNon-securitised mortgage loans include \u00a37,784 million (2021: \u00a39,699 million) of residential equity release mortgages, \u00a35,971 million (2021: \u00a37,246 million) of commercial mortgages and \u00a32,000 million (2021: \u00a32,508 million) relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses. The healthcare and PFI mortgage loans are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises. For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan. Although the loan principal is not government-guaranteed, the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is the carrying amount of each class of financial assets mentioned above.\n\n## Loans at amortised cost\n\nThe carrying amount of these loans at both 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 was a reasonable approximation for their fair value.\n\n## (b) Analysis of loans carried at amortised cost\n\n|                                | 2022              | 2022          | 2022              | 2021              | 2021          | 2021              |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n|                                | Amortised Cost \u00a3m | Impairment \u00a3m | Carrying Value \u00a3m | Amortised Cost \u00a3m | Impairment \u00a3m | Carrying Value \u00a3m |\n| Policy loans                   | 13                | -             | 13                | 13                | -             | 13                |\n| Loans to banks                 | 2,913             | -             | 2,913             | 7,996             | -             | 7,996             |\n| Non-securitised mortgage loans | -                 | -             | -                 | -                 | -             | -                 |\n| Other loans                    | 801               | -             | 801               | 635               | -             | 635               |\n| Total                          | 3,727             | -             | 3,727             | 8,644             | -             | 8,644             |\n\nThe movements in the impairment provisions on these loans were as follows:\n\n|                                            | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January                               | -         | (16)      |\n| Increase during the year                   | -         | (2)       |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements            | -         | 1         |\n| Write back following sale or reimbursement | -         | 17        |\n| At 31 December                             | -         | -         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 23 - Loans continued\n\n## (c) Collateral\n\nLoans to banks include cash collateral received under stock lending arrangements (see note 60 for further information regarding these collateral positions). The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities (see note 52).\n\nThe Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate in order to reduce the risk of non-recovery. This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above. In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.\n\n## 24 - Securitised mortgages and related assets\n\nThe Group, in its UK Life business, has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings. This note gives details of the relevant transactions.\n\n## (a) Description of current arrangements\n\nIn a UK long-term business subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies), in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration. The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments. The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.\n\nAll the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust. Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it has control of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements. AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.\n\nAER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies. In addition, Group companies have invested \u00a3208 million (2021: \u00a3213 million) in loan notes issued by the ERF companies. These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the statement of financial position.\n\nIn all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support. Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.\n\n## (b) Carrying values\n\nThe following table summarises the securitisation arrangements:\n\n|                                                            | 2022 Securitised      | 2022 Securitised   | 2021                  | 2021                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                            | Securitised assets \u00a3m | liabilities \u00a3m     | Securitised assets \u00a3m | Securitised liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Securitised mortgage loans (note 23) and loan notes issued | 1,759                 | (1,299)            | 2,231                 | (1,353)                    |\n| Other securitisation assets/(liabilities)                  | 286                   | (746)              | 302                   | (1,180)                    |\n|                                                            | 2,045                 | (2,045)            | 2,533                 | (2,533)                    |\n\nLoan notes held by third parties are as follows:\n\n|                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total loan notes issued, as above                | 1,299     | 1,353     |\n| Less: Loan notes held by Group companies         | (208)     | (213)     |\n| Loan notes held by third parties (note 51(c)(i)) | 1,091     | 1,140     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 25 - Interests in structured entities\n\nA structured entity is defined as an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only, or when the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements. The Group has interests in both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entities as described below.\n\nThe Group holds redeemable shares or units in investment vehicles, which consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities comprising of securitisation vehicles that Aviva does not originate. These investments are comprised of a variety of debt instruments, including asset-backed securities and other structured securities.\n- \u00b7 Investment funds which include: hedge funds, liquidity funds, private equity funds, unit trusts, mutual funds and Private Finance Initiatives (PFIs).\n- \u00b7 Specialised investment vehicles include Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Property Limited Partnerships (PLPs), Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s d'Investissement a Capital Variable (SICAVs), Tax Transparent Funds (TTFs) and other investment vehicles.\n\nThe Group's holdings in investment vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle's offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles. The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance-based incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (a) Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has determined that where it has control over investment vehicles, these investments are consolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2022 the Group has granted loans to consolidated PLPs for a total of \u00a382 million (2021: \u00a377 million). The purpose of these loans is to assist the consolidated PLPs to purchase or construct properties. The Group has also provided support, without having a contractual obligation to do so, to certain consolidated PLPs via letters of support amounting to \u00a373 million (2021: \u00a373 million). The Group has commitments to provide funding to consolidated structured entities of \u00a3311 million (2021: \u00a3372 million), primarily relating to a commitment to provide funding to the Aviva Investors Climate Transition Real Assets fund.\n\nThe Group has also given support to five special purpose securitisation companies (the ERF companies) that are consolidated structured entities. As set out in note 24 , at the inception of the securitisation vehicles, the UK subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited (AER), has granted subordinated loan facilities to some of the ERF companies. AER receives various fees in return for the services provided to the entities. AER receives cash management fees based on the outstanding loan balance at the start of each quarter for the administration of the loan note liabilities.

In some cases, the Group may be required to absorb losses from an unconsolidated structured entity before other parties when and if Aviva's interest is more subordinated with respect to other owners of the same security.\n\nFor commitments to property management joint ventures and associates, please see notes 17 and 18, respectively. The Group has not provided any other financial or other support in addition to that described above as at the reporting date, and there are no intentions to provide support in relation to any other unconsolidated structured entities in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn relation to risk management, disclosures on debt securities and investment vehicles are given in note 58(b) 'Risk management'. In relation to other guarantees and commitments that the Group provides in the course of its business, please see note 54(f) 'Contingent liabilities and other risk factors'.\n\nAviva's interest in unconsolidated structured entities that it also manages at 31 December 2022 is \u00a31,648 million (2021: \u00a31,502 million) and the total funds under management relating to these investments at 31 December 2022 is \u00a317,381 million (2021: \u00a316,843 million).\n\n## (c) Other interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group receives management fees and other fees in respect of its asset management businesses. The Group does not sponsor any of the funds or investment vehicles from which it receives fees. Management fees received for investments that the Group manages, but does not have a holding in, also represent an interest in unconsolidated structured entities. As these investments are not held by the Group, the investment risk is borne by the external investors and therefore the Group's maximum exposure to loss relates to future management fees. The table below shows the assets under management of entities that the Group manages but does not have a holding in and the fees earned from those entities.\n\n|                                  | 2022                         | 2022                            | 2021                         | 2021                             |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                  | Assets under  management  \u00a3m | Investment  management  fees \u00a3m | Assets under  management  \u00a3m | Investment  management  fees  \u00a3m |\n| Specialised investment vehicles: | 5,623                        | 22                              | 6,036                        | 24                               |\n| Analysed as:                     |                              |                                 |                              |                                  |\n| OEICs                            | 398                          | 1                               | 253                          | 2                                |\n| PLPs                             | 4,165                        | 17                              | 4,257                        | 16                               |\n| SICAVs                           | 1,060                        | 4                               | 1,526                        | 6                                |\n| Total                            | 5,623                        | 22                              | 6,036                        | 24                               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Of this net loss, \u00a343,663 million net loss (2021: \u00a36,862 million net gain) related to investments designated as other than trading and \u00a35,020 million net loss (2021: \u00a32,481 million net loss) related to financial investments designated as trading. The net loss is primarily driven by a significant increase in interest rates reducing the value of the fixed maturity securities.\n\nThe movement in the unrealised gain/loss position reported in the statement of financial position during the year, shown in the table above, includes foreign exchange movements on the translation of unrealised gains and losses on financial investments held by foreign subsidiaries, which are recognised in other comprehensive income, as well as transfers due to the realisation of gains and losses on disposal and the recognition of impairment losses.\n\n## (c) Financial investment arrangements\n\n## (i) Stock lending arrangements\n\nThe Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas in accordance with established market conventions. The majority of the Group's stock lending transactions occur in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.\n\nThe Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements, either in the form of securities or cash. See note 60 for further information regarding collateral positions held by the Group.\n\n## (ii) Other arrangements\n\nIn carrying on its Bulk Purchase Annuity business, the Group's UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders. Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits. At 31 December 2022, \u00a31,778 million (2021: \u00a32,425 million) of financial investments were restricted in this way.\n\nCertain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries. Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

DAC for general insurance and health business increased over 2022.\n\nWhere amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit. It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by \u00a341 million (2021: \u00a369 million) if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by \u00a348 million (2021: \u00a368 million) if yields were to reduce by 1%.\n\nAt both 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 the DAC balance has been restricted by the value of projected future profits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These assets are financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss and are classified as Level 1 assets.\n\n## 31 - Ordinary share capital\n\nThis note gives details of Aviva plc's ordinary share capital and shows the movements during the year.\n\n## (a) Share buyback\n\nOn 31 March 2022, Aviva completed the share buyback programme originally announced on 12 August 2021, and extended to an aggregate purchase of up to \u00a31 billion on 16 December 2021. In total, 245,225,489 shares were purchased with a nominal value of \u00a361 million and were subsequently cancelled, giving rise to an additional capital redemption reserve of an equivalent amount. The 245,225,489 shares were acquired at an average price of 408 pence per share. 79,587,629 shares were purchased during 2022, had a nominal value of \u00a319 million, for total consideration of \u00a3336 million and were acquired at an average price of 423 pence per share. 165,237,860 ordinary shares were purchased and cancelled during 2021, had a nominal value of \u00a342 million, for a total consideration of \u00a3663 million and were acquired at an average price of 401 pence per share.\n\n## (b) Return of capital to ordinary shareholders via B share scheme\n\nOn 2 March 2022, Aviva announced a proposed return of capital, including a \u00a33,750 million B Share Scheme for the holders of ordinary shares. 3,687,322,000 B shares were issued for nil consideration with a nominal value of 101.69 pence per share on 16 May 2022, resulting in a total of \u00a33,750 million being credited to the B share capital account. At the same time, the merger reserve was reduced by \u00a33,750 million. On 17 May 2022, the B shares were redeemed at 101.69 pence per share, which resulted in a \u00a33,750 million reduction in the B share capital account and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve. Retained earnings reduced by \u00a33,750 million on payment of the return of capital to ordinary shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are as follows:\n\n## (i) Savings-related options\n\nThese are options granted under the tax-advantaged Save As You Earn (SAYE) share option scheme in the UK and prior to 2021 the Irish revenue-approved SAYE share option scheme in Ireland. From 2021 options in Ireland are granted under the Irish non-revenue approved SAYE share option scheme. The SAYE allows eligible employees to acquire options over the Company's shares at a discount of up to 20% of their market value at the date of grant.\n\nOptions are normally exercisable during the six month period following either the third or fifth anniversary of the start of the relevant savings contract. Savings contracts are subject to the statutory savings limits of \u00a3500 per month in the UK and \u20ac500 per month in Ireland. A limit of \u00a3250 per month was applied to contracts in the UK prior to 2016.\n\n## (ii) Aviva long-term incentive plan awards\n\nThese awards have been made under the Aviva Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) and are described in the Directors' Remuneration Report (DRR).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The awards vest in tranches on various dates and vesting is conditional upon the participant being employed by the Group on the vesting date and not having served notice of resignation. Some awards can be subject to performance conditions. If a participant's employment is terminated due to resignation or dismissal, any tranche of the award which has vested within the 12 months prior to the termination date may be subject to clawback and any unvested tranches of the award will lapse in full.\n\n## (v) Aviva Investors deferred share award plan awards\n\nThese awards have been made under the Aviva Investors Deferred Share Award Plan (AI DSAP), where employees could choose to have the deferred element of their bonus deferred into awards over Aviva shares. The awards vest in three equal tranches on the first, second and third anniversaries of grant.

Holders are entitled to receive dividends out of the profits available for distribution and resolved to be distributed in priority to the payment of dividends to holders of ordinary shares. The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the fair value of Aviva plc's preference share capital was \u00a3247 million (2021: \u00a3304.5 million) .\n\n## 35 - Tier 1 notes\n\nOn 15 June 2022, the Group issued \u00a3500 million of 6.875% fixed rate reset perpetual Restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes (the RT1 notes) (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\nThe RT1 notes are callable at par between 15 December 2031 and 15 June 2032 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and thereafter every five years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 15 June 2032 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 4.649%. The notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the Group and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The RT1 notes are therefore treated as equity and the coupon payment is recognised directly in equity. During the year coupon payments of \u00a317 million were made (2021: \u00a3nil). On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Group.\n\n## 36 - Merger reserve\n\nThis note analyses the movement in the merger reserve during the year.\n\n|                          | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At 1 January             | 8,974     | 8,974     |\n| Issue of B share capital | (3,750)   | -         |\n| At 31 December           | 5,224     | 8,974     |\n\nPrior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the 'pooling of interests method' (or merger accounting), which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.\n\nMerger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiary's own share capital and share premium account.\n\nThe merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.\n\nOn 16 May 2022 the Company issued 3,687,322,000 B shares reducing the Company's merger reserve by \u00a33,750 million (see note 31(b)).\n\n<!-- image -->",

For general insurance and health, the change in the provision for unearned premiums is not included in the reconciliation as, within the income statement, this is included within earned premiums.\n\n| 2022                                                                     | Gross \u00a3m   | Reinsurance \u00a3m   | Net \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------|----------|\n| Long-term business                                                       |            |                  |          |\n| Change in insurance liabilities (note 41(b)(iii))                        | (25,175)   | 2,316            | (22,859) |\n| Change in provision for outstanding claims                               | 108        | (3)              | 105      |\n|                                                                          | (25,067)   | 2,313            | (22,754) |\n| General insurance and health                                             |            |                  |          |\n| Change in insurance liabilities (note 41(c)(iv) and 45(c)(ii))           | 482        | (66)             | 416      |\n| Change in provision arising from liability adequacy tests                | (2)        | -                | (2)      |\n| Less: Unwind of discount                                                 | (7)        | 5                | (2)      |\n|                                                                          | 473        | (61)             | 412      |\n| Total change in insurance liabilities from continued operations (note 5) | (24,594)   | 2,252            | (22,342) |\n| 2021                                                                     | Gross \u00a3m   | Reinsurance \u00a3m   | Net \u00a3m   |\n| Long-term business                                                       |            |                  |          |\n| Change in insurance liabilities (note 41(b)(iii))                        | 2,521      | (951)            | 1,570    |\n| Change in provision for outstanding claims                               | (291)      | 1                | (290)    |\n|                                                                          | 2,230      | (950)            | 1,280    |\n| General insurance and health                                             |            |                  |          |\n| Change in insurance liabilities (note 41(c)(iv) and 45(c)(ii))           | 641        | 114              | 755      |\n| Change in provision arising from liability adequacy tests                | (1)        | -                | (1)      |\n| Less: Unwind of discount                                                 | (2)        | 1                | (1)      |\n|                                                                          | 638        | 115              | 753      |\n| Total change in insurance liabilities                                    | 2,868      | (835)            | 2,033    |\n| Less: Change in insurance liabilities from discontinued operations       | (3,736)    | 4                | (3,732)  |\n| Total change in insurance liabilities from continued operations (note 5) | (868)      | (831)            | (1,699)  |\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts, deposits collected and amounts withdrawn are not shown on the income statement, but are accounted for directly through the statement of financial position as an adjustment to the gross liabilities for investment contracts. The associated change in investment contract provisions shown on the income statement consists of the attributed investment return. For participating investment contracts, the change in investment contract provisions on the income statement primarily consists of the movement in participating investment contract liabilities (net of reinsurance) over the reporting period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is mainly written in the 'Non-Profit' funds and in a number of 'With-Profits' sub-funds. In the 'Non -Profit' funds shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits. In the 'With-Profits' sub-funds the with-profits policyholders are entitled to between 40% and 100% of distributed profits, depending on the fund rules. There is also the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account (RIEESA) in the UK, which does not itself underwrite any business, but provides capital support to one of the 'With-Profits' sub-funds and receives any surplus or deficit emerging from it. In the RIEESA, shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these can only be distributed in line with the criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme.\n\n## (ii) Group practice\n\nThe long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each of the Group's life operations. The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nMaterial judgement is required in calculating the liabilities and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted. In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations. Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and morbidity rates. Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.\n\nBonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business liabilities.\n\nA description of the main methodology and most material valuation assumptions has been provided (see note 42).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Other movements recognised as an expense in 2022 and 2021 relate primarily to provisions for bonus distribution to with-profits policyholders and legacy unclaimed assets\n- 2. The movement in 2022 relates to the acquisition of an additional 25% of the ordinary shares of Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited giving Aviva a controlling interest in the entity (see note 2(a)). The movement in 2021 relates to the disposal of the France, Italy, Poland and Vietnam businesses.\n- 3. The movement in 2022 primarily relates to a reallocation between non-par investment contracts and insurance contracts for UK Life\n\nFor many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating insurance liabilities, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit. The gross long-term business liabilities decreased by \u00a323.9 billion during 2022 (2021: \u00a329.6 billion decrease) due to:\n\n- \u00b7 Expected change on existing business of \u00a3(5.5) billion, largely offset by \u00a34.8 billion increase due to new business which is primarily due to bulk purchase annuities sales in the UK;\n- \u00b7 Variance between actual and expected experience of \u00a3(2.1) billion, which was mainly due to lower than expected equity returns for the UK and material increases in yields in the UK;\n- \u00b7 Impact of operating assumption changes of \u00a3(1.3) billion, mainly due to longevity assumptions applying to annuity business in the UK; and\n- \u00b7 Economic assumption changes of \u00a3(21.1) billion, which reflects an increase in valuation interest rates in response to increasing interest rates and widening of credit spreads primarily in respect of annuity contracts.\n\nFor participating insurance liabilities, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact profit. Where assumption changes impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year (see note 46), together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.\n\n## (c) General insurance and health liabilities\n\n## (i) Business description\n\nThe Group underwrites:\n\n- \u00b7 General insurance and health business in the UK and Ireland, providing individual and corporate customers with a wide range of insurance products;\n- \u00b7 General insurance business in Canada, providing a range of personal and commercial lines products.\n\n## (ii) Group practice\n\nDelays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date. The liabilities for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.\n\nProvisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) in respect of all claims that have already occurred. The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.\n\nThe Group only establishes reserves for losses that have already occurred. When calculating reserves, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation. A separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year, while the lower section of the tables shows the original estimated ultimate cost of claims and how these original estimates have increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.\n\nKey elements of the development of prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2022 were:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00a364 million strengthening from the UK due to adverse experience and additional provisioning in property and higher inflation. These were partially offset by motor releases.\n- \u00b7 \u00a332 million release from Ireland due to motor releases and favourable liability experience.\n- \u00b7 \u00a385 million release from Canada primarily due to favourable experience in both personal and commercial motor; partially offset by strengthening of commercial liability reserves.\n\nKey elements of the development of prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2021 were:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00a351 million release from the UK and Ireland primarily due to releases across motor due to favourable large claims experience partially offset by adverse experience with commercial liability and personal property;\n- \u00b7 \u00a352 million release from Canada primarily due to favourable experience in commercial property and commercial motor, partially offset by commercial liability strengthening from large loss development and adverse latent claims; and\n- \u00b7 \u00a354 million strengthening from discontinued markets mainly from adverse claims development in France.\n\n## Gross of reinsurance\n\nBefore the effect of reinsurance, the loss development table is:\n\n| Accident year

are translated into sterling at the exchange rates that applied at the end of that accident year. The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table. Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as 'paid' at the date of disposal.\n\nThe loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written more than 10 years ago. The undiscounted claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2022 were \u00a386 million (2021: \u00a387 million). The movement in asbestos and environmental pollution liabilities in the year reflects an increase of \u00a32 million due to adverse large claims experience and claims development offset by claims payments net of reinsurance recoveries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 42 - Insurance liabilities methodology and assumptions\n\n## (a) Long-term business i) UK\n\nThe main method used for the actuarial valuation of long-term insurance liabilities is the gross premium method which involves the discounting of projected future cash flows. The cash flows are calculated using the contractual premiums payable together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, discount rates, inflation, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses. These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience with an allowance for prudence.\n\n## Non-profit business\n\nThe valuation of non -profit business is based on grandfathered regulatory requirements under IFRS 4 prior to the adoption of Solvency II, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business. Conventional non -profit contracts, including those written in the with-profits funds, are valued using the gross premium method.\n\nFor unit -linked and some unitised with -profits business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non -unit reserve to the bid value of units. The prospective non -unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non -unit cash flows using prudent assumptions and on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nValuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long -term interest rates as measured by gilt yields. An explicit allowance for risk is included by making a deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class. For equity release assets, the risk allowances are consistent with those used in the fair value asset methodology (see note 22). A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.\n\nValuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows:\n\n| Valuation discount rates (Gross of investment expenses)   | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Assurances                                                |            |            |\n| Life conventional non-profit                              | 3.5%       | 1.1%       |\n| Pensions conventional non-profit                          | 3.5%       | 1.1%       |\n| Annuities                                                 |            |            |\n| Conventional immediate and deferred annuities             | 3.5% to 5% | 1.1% to 2% |\n| Non-unit reserves on unit-linked business                 |            |            |\n| Life                                                      | 2.8%       | 0.9%       |\n| Pensions                                                  | 3.5%       | 1.1%       |\n| Income Protection                                         |            |            |\n| Active lives                                              | 3.5%       | 1.1%       |\n| Claims in payment (level and index linked)                | 3.5%       | 1.1%       |\n\nThe valuation discount rates are after a reduction for risk, but before allowance for investment expenses. For conventional immediate annuity business, the allowance for risk comprises long -term assumptions on a prudent basis for defaults or, in the case of equity release assets, expected losses arising from the No -Negative -Equity Guarantee. These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating.\n\nThe risk allowances made for corporate bonds (including overseas government bonds and structured finance assets), mortgages (including healthcare mortgages, commercial mortgages and infrastructure assets), and equity release equated to 34 bps, 28 bps, and 98 bps respectively at 31 December 2022 (2021: 44 bps, 30 bps, and 91 bps respectively).\n\nThe total valuation allowance in respect of corporate bonds was \u00a30.7 billion (2021: \u00a31.4 billion) over the remaining term of the portfolio at 31 December 2022. The total valuation allowance in respect of mortgages (including healthcare mortgages but excluding equity release) was \u00a30.3 billion at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a30.5 billion). The total valuation allowance in respect of equity release mortgages was \u00a30.8 billion at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a31.2 billion). Total liabilities for the annuity business were \u00a348.5 billion at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a363.0 billion).\n\n## Expenses\n\nMaintenance expense assumptions for non-profit business are generally expressed as a per policy charge set with regards to an allocation of current year expense levels by broad category of business and using the policy counts for in-force business. The assumptions also include an allowance for prudence and increase by future expense inflation over the lifetime of each contract. Expense inflation is assumed to be in line with RPI. An additional liability is held if projected per policy expenses in future years are expected to exceed current assumptions. A further allowance is made for non-discretionary project costs that typically relate to mandatory requirements. Expense-related liabilities are not held where expenses are covered by anticipated future profits in the liability methodology, notably for unit-linked contracts. Investment expense assumptions are generally expressed as a proportion of the assets backing the liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

An allowance has been made to allow for greater mortality improvements in the annuitant population relative to the general population on which CMI\\_2021 is based using 'Parameter A', which is set to 0.15% for males and 0.20% for females, tapering to zero between ages 90 and 110 (for 2021 the same approach was taken with respect to CMI\\_2019). Long-term improvement rates are set to taper to zero between ages 85 and 110 (2021: between 90 and 115). In addition, on a significant proportion of individual annuity business, year-specific adjustments are made to allow for potential selection effects due to the development of the Enhanced Annuity market and covering possible selection effects from pension freedom reforms (unchanged from 2021).\n\n## With-profits business\n\nThe Group's UK with -profits funds are evaluated by reference to FRS 27, which was grandfathered under IFRS 4, prior to the adoption of Solvency II. This uses an approach of calculating the realistic liabilities for the contracts. The realistic liabilities include the with -profits benefit reserve (WPBR), and an additional provision for the expected cost of any guarantees and options in excess of the WPBR.\n\nThe WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.\n\nProvisions for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities are measured using market -consistent stochastic models. A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions. Non -market -related assumptions (for example, persistency, mortality and expenses) are assessed on a best estimate basis with reference to Company and wider industry experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.\n\nThe with -profits business is valued by adjusting Solvency II Best Estimate Liabilities and results in a valuation in accordance with FRS 27.\n\n## Future investment return\n\nA risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK swaps is used for the valuation of with-profits business. The rates vary according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2022 of 3.71% (2021: 0.95%) for a policy with ten years outstanding.\n\n## Volatility of investment return\n\nVolatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.\n\n| Volatility       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity returns   | 19.3%  | 19.4%  |\n| Property returns | 15.0%  | 15.4%  |\n\nThe equity volatility used depends on term, moneyness and region. The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a tenyear term.\n\n## Future regular bonuses\n\nAnnual bonus assumptions for 2023 have been set consistently with the year-end 2022 declaration. Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of each fund. In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The memorandum of understanding specifies the charges for a five-year period ending in 2023, and specifies a level of charge inflation during that period of CPI+2% or CPI+3% depending on the product type. After the end of the period covered by the memorandum of understanding we assume that the charges will remain unchanged, and a level of charge inflation of RPI+1% for all products will apply.

These credit default allowances vary by asset category and rating.\n\n|                                   | Discount rates used   | Discount rates used   | Mortality tables used                                         |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mortality table used              | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2021 & 2022                                                   |\n| Assurances                        |                       |                       |                                                               |\n| Life                              | 1.2% to 3.7%          | -0.9% to-0.3%         | TMS08/TMN08/TFS08/TFN08 adjusted                              |\n| Pensions                          | 1.7% to 3.7%          | -0.8% to 0.7%         | TMS08/TMN08/TFS08/TFN08 adjusted                              |\n| Annuities                         | 3.7 %                 | -0.3% to 0.8%         | PMA08/PFA08 (conventional) adjusted plus allowance for future |\n| Non unit reserves for unit-linked | 3.7 %                 | -0.3% to -0.2%        | AMN00/AMS00/AFN00/AFS00 adjusted                              |\n| Income protection                 |                       |                       |                                                               |\n| Active lives                      | 2.2% to 3.7%          | -0.3% to -0.2%        |                                                               |\n| Claims in payment                 | 2.2% to 3.7%          | -0.3% to -0.2%        |                                                               |\n\n## (b) General insurance and health\n\nOutstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation. Case estimates are set by skilled claims technicians and established case setting procedures. Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for estimate authorisation.\n\nNo adjustments are made to the claims technicians' case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claims may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case. The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.\n\nThe assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based. Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved. The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Note assumptions below are for continuing markets only so comparatives have been updated to exclude disposed markets:\n\n|                                  | Discount rate   | Discount rate   | Mean term of liabilities   | Mean term of liabilities   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Class                            | 2022            | 2021            | 2022                       | 2021                       |\n| Reinsured London Market business | 3.0% to 5.2%    | 0.5% to 1.8%    | 8 years                    | 8 years                    |\n| Latent claims                    | 3.1% to 4.6%    | 0.7% to 1.9%    | 7 to 10 years              | 8 to 11 years              |\n| Structured settlements           | 2.9% to 4.5%    | 0.9% to 2.3%    | 34 years                   | 35 years                   |\n\nThe period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.\n\nThe discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves, structured settlements and reinsured London Market business is based on the swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement dates of the claims. The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately \u00a337 million (2021: \u00a380 million), excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.\n\n## UK mesothelioma claims\n\nThe level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities. UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Group's latent claims. The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees. The best estimate of the liabilities considers the latest available market information and studies and how these might impact Aviva's liabilities.\n\n## Allowance for risk and uncertainty\n\nThe uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions. The reserve estimation basis requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty. The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory. The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.\n\nLump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims that are decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables and discount rate. The Ogden discount rate is set by the Lord Chancellor and is applied when calculating the present value of future care costs and loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes. The balance sheet reserves in the UK have been calculated using the current Ogden discount rate of -0.25%, as this is the enacted legislative rate that was announced by the Lord Chancellor in August 2019. The Ogden discount rate is expected to be reviewed by the Lord Chancellor by summer 2024.\n\n## 43 - Liabilities for investment contracts\n\nThis note analyses our gross liabilities for investment contracts by type of product and describes the calculation of these liabilities.\n\n## (a) Carrying amount\n\nThe liabilities for investment contracts (gross of reinsurance) at 31 December 2022 comprised:\n\n|                                                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Long-term business                                     |           |           |\n| Liabilities for participating investment contracts     | 18,009    | 21,337    |\n| Liabilities for non-participating investment contracts | 140,990   | 151,115   |\n| Total                                                  | 158,999   | 172,452   |\n\n## (b) Group practice\n\nInvestment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.\n\nMany investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits. These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology for long-term business liabilities (see note 42). They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS. In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall. The IASB deferred consideration of participating contracts to the IFRS 17 insurance standard, which will apply to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 43 - Liabilities for investment contracts continued\n\nFor participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated divisible surplus, except for the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA. Guarantees on longterm investment products are discussed in note 44.\n\nInvestment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost. We currently have no non-participating investment contracts measured at amortised cost.\n\nOf the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, \u00a3140,949 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3151,016 million) are unit -linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the current unit fund value, including any unfunded units, plus if required, additional non-unit reserves based on a discounted cash flow analysis. These contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number of units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.\n\nFor unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term. The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 28 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 53.\n\nFor non-participating investment contracts acquired in a business combination, an acquired value of in-force business asset is recognised in respect of the fair value of the investment management services component of the contracts, which is amortised on a systematic basis over the useful lifetime of the related contracts. The amount of the acquired value of in-force business asset is shown in note 16, which relates primarily to the acquisition of Friends Life in 2015 and Friends First in 2018.\n\n## (c) Movements in the year\n\nThe following movements have occurred in the gross provisions for investment contracts in the year:\n\n## (i) Participating investment contracts\n\n|                                                             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Carrying amount at 1 January                                | 21,337    | 97,073    |\n| Liabilities in respect of new business                      | 10        | 3,621     |\n| Expected change in existing business                        | (1,479)   | (4,196)   |\n| Variance between actual and expected experience             | (1,287)   | 2,499     |\n| Impact of operating assumption changes                      | 21        | (31)      |\n| Impact of economic assumption changes                       | (657)     | (132)     |\n| Other movements recognised as an expense 1                  | 47        | (49)      |\n| Change in liability recognised as an expense 2              | (3,345)   | 1,712     |\n| Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 3 | -         | (74,179)  |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements                             | 17        | (3,269)   |\n| Carrying amount at 31 December                              | 18,009    | 21,337    |\n\n- 2. Total interest expense for participating investment contracts recognised in the consolidated income statement is \u00a3(2,061) million (2021: \u00a32,362 million)\n\nFor many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.\n\nThe variance between actual and expected experience in 2022 of \u00a3(1.3) billion is primarily due to decreases in global equity markets and lower bond and gilt values as a result of increasing interest rates.\n\nThe impact of assumption changes in the analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of participating investment contract liabilities. For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact profit. Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 46, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Provision for these guarantees do not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to \u00a335 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a363 million).\n\n## (ii) Guaranteed unit price on certain products\n\nCertain pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death. No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.\n\n## (iii) Return of Premium guarantees\n\nCertain German pension products sold in Friends Life between 2006 and 2014 are subject to a return of premium guarantee whereby the product guarantees to return the maximum of the unit fund value or total premiums paid (before deductions). Provisions for this guarantee are calculated using a market-consistent stochastic model and amount to \u00a392 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3164 million).\n\n## (b) UK with-profits business\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits liabilities are evaluated by reference to FRS 27, which was grandfathered under IFRS 4, prior to the adoption of Solvency II. Under the PRA's rules, provisions for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities are measured using market-consistent stochastic models. A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.\n\nThe material guarantees and options relating to this provision are:\n\n## (i) Maturity value and death benefit guarantees\n\nSignificant conventional and unitised with-profits business have minimum maturity (and in some cases death benefit) values reflecting the sum assured plus declared annual bonus. For some unitised with-profits life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in retail price index (RPI) or consumer price index (CPI).\n\n## (ii) No market valuation reduction (MVR) guarantees\n\nFor unitised business, there are circumstances where a 'no MVR' guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.\n\nRealistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profits funds were \u00a3556 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a31,293 million). With the exception of the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profits funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit. Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the with-profits sub-fund supported by the RIEESA were \u00a350 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3109 million).\n\n## (iv) Guaranteed minimum pension\n\nThe Group's UK with-profits funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pension as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.\n\n## (v) Guaranteed minimum maturity payments on mortgage endowments\n\nThe with-profits funds made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profits mortgage endowments. Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.\n\n## (c) Ireland\n\n## Guaranteed annuity options and guaranteed maturity values\n\nAs in the UK, the Group's with-profits liabilities in Ireland are measured on a realistic basis, including realistic liabilities for guarantees and options. Guarantees and options in Ireland include GAOs, minimum maturity values on conventional with-profits business, guaranteed minimum bonus rates on unitised with profits business, and a 'no MVR' guarantee that may apply at certain policy anniversaries.\n\n## 45 - Reinsurance assets\n\nThis note details the reinsurance assets on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.\n\n## (a) Carrying amount\n\nThe reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised:\n\n|                                                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Long-term business                              |           |           |\n| Insurance contracts                             | 5,662     | 7,887     |\n| Non-participating investment contracts\u00b9         | 5,254     | 5,132     |\n|                                                 | 10,916    | 13,019    |\n| Outstanding claims provisions                   | 68        | 61        |\n|                                                 | 10,984    | 13,080    |\n| General insurance and health                    |           |           |\n| Outstanding claims provisions                   | 964       | 637       |\n| Provisions for claims incurred but not reported | 763       | 999       |\n|                                                 | 1,727     | 1,636     |\n| Provisions for unearned premiums                | 345       | 316       |\n|                                                 | 2,072     | 1,952     |\n| Total                                           | 13,056    | 15,032    |\n\n- 1. Amounts in respect of all reinsurance treaties are included under reinsurance assets, regardless of whether they transfer significant insurance risk.

This line also includes changes to liabilities in respect of annuity contracts linked to inflation.\n\nThe impact of change in mortality and morbidity assumptions for assurance contracts relates mainly to the UK following a review of recent experience and moving onto the latest CMI series mortality tables.\n\nThe impact of mortality for annuitant contracts on long-term business relates primarily to the UK. In 2022, there has been a reduction in reserves due to longevity assumptions arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 Updates to base mortality to reflect methodology and process refinements on BPA business, totalling \u00a354 million;\n- \u00b7 Updates to the rate of mortality improvements for a change to the long-term-rate rate used to taper improvements at the oldest ages from between ages 90 to 115 to between ages 85 to 110, which gave a reduction of \u00a3382 million and\n- \u00b7 Updates to mortality improvements moving onto the latest CMI\\_2021 model from CMI\\_2019, which gave a reduction of \u00a3101 million.\n\nIn 2021 there was a reduction in reserves due to longevity assumptions arising from:\n\n- \u00b7 Updates to base mortality to reflect experience and updated assumptions for anti-selection on individual annuities totalling \u00a3112 million; and\n- \u00b7 Updates to the rate of mortality improvements, consisting of a change to the allowance for differences in mortality improvements in the annuitant population compared to the general population on which CMI\\_2019 is based of \u00a3195 million and other adjustments of \u00a3(41) million.\n\nIn the general insurance and health business, an impact of \u00a3147 million (2021: \u00a3(85) million) has arisen primarily as a result of a material increase in the interest rates used to discount claim reserves for both periodic payment orders (PPOs) and latent claims.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The movement in 2021 relates to disposal of the France, Italy and Poland businesses.\n\nThe amount of UDS at 31 December 2022 has remained broadly unchanged at \u00a31,990 million (2021: \u00a31,960 million). Market movements primarily due to a material increase in interest rates (and reduction in global equity) have reduced the participating fund assets but these changes are broadly offset by an equivalent reduction in participating fund liabilities.\n\nWhere the aggregate amount of participating assets is less than the participating liabilities within a fund then the shortfall may be held as negative UDS, subject to recoverability testing as part of the liability adequacy requirements of IFRS 4.

These positions are expected to reverse as the market recovers. The deferred tax asset relates to UK tax losses which carry forward indefinitely and is recognised based on probable future taxable investment income and gains within 5 years. Assumed investment returns are consistent with actuarial assumptions used in reserving and alternative assumptions modelled by the Group also show full recovery of the deferred tax asset over this period.\n\nWhere shareholder deferred tax assets are not supported by deferred tax liabilities, they are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the tax losses can be utilised. In assessing future profitability, the directors have relied on board approved business plans and profit forecasts for up to 5 years and the Group's history of taxable profits in the relevant jurisdictions.\n\nThe Group has unrecognised gross tax losses (excluding capital losses) and other temporary differences of \u00a3568 million (2021: \u00a3819 million) to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned. Of these, trading losses of \u00a326 million (2021: \u00a311 million) will expire within the next 8 years. The remaining losses have no expiry date.\n\nIn addition, the Group has unrecognised gross capital losses of \u00a3579 million (2021: \u00a3575 million). These have no expiry date.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, a potential deferred tax liability of \u00a324 million (2021: \u00a326 million) is not recognised on temporary differences relating to reserves of overseas subsidiaries which are not expected to be distributed.\n\n## 49 - Pension deficits and other provisions\n\nThis note details the non-insurance provisions that the Group holds and shows the movements in these during the year.\n\n## (a) Carrying amounts\n\n|                                                                |   2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total IAS 19 obligations to staff pension schemes (note 50(a)) |       360 | 485       |\n| Restructuring provisions                                       |        70 | 119       |\n| Other provisions                                               |       331 | 397       |\n| Total provisions                                               |       761 | 1,001     |\n\nOther provisions includes amounts set aside throughout the Group relating to product governance rectification.\n\n## (b) Movements in restructuring and other provisions\n\n|                                      | 2022                        | 2022                | 2022     | 2021                        | 2021                | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------|\n|                                      | Restructuring provisions \u00a3m | Other provisions \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Restructuring provisions \u00a3m | Other provisions \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January                         | 119                         | 397                 | 516      | 48                          | 565                 | 613      |\n| Additional provisions                | -                           | 132                 | 132      | 79                          | 235                 | 314      |\n| Provisions released during the year  | -                           | (91)                | (91)     | -                           | (193)               | (193)    |\n| Charge to income statement           | -                           | 41                  | 41       | 79                          | 42                  | 121      |\n| Utilised during the year             | (49)                        | (163)               | (212)    | (8)                         | (147)               | (155)    |\n| Acquisition/disposal of subsidiaries | -                           | 55                  | 55       | -                           | (60)                | (60)     |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements      | -                           | 1                   | 1        | -                           | (3)                 | (3)      |\n| At 31 December                       | 70                          | 331                 | 401      | 119                         | 397                 | 516      |\n\nOf the total restructuring and other provisions, \u00a3119 million (2021: \u00a343 million) is expected to be settled more than one year after the statement of financial position date.\n\nRestructuring provisions include amounts for separation costs and onerous contracts arising as a result of disposal transactions completed in 2020 and 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section (b)(i) below, whilst the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section (d) below.\n\nUnder the IAS 19 valuation basis, the Group applies the principles of IFRIC 14 IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, whereby a surplus is only recognised to the extent that the company is able to access the surplus either through an unconditional right of refund to the surplus or through reduced future contributions relating to ongoing service, which have been substantively enacted or contractually agreed. The Group has determined that it can derive economic benefit from the surplus in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme (ASPS) via a reduction to future employer contributions for defined contribution (DC) members, which could theoretically be paid from the surplus funds in the ASPS. In the RAC (2003) Pension Scheme and Friends Provident Pension Scheme (FPPS), in the UK and in the Aviva Ireland Staff Pension Fund (AISPF) in Ireland, the Group has determined that the rules set out in the schemes' governing documentation provide for an unconditional right to a refund from any future surplus funds in the schemes.\n\nThe assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees. In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes' beneficiaries. The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.\n\nA funding actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members. Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.\n\nThe number of scheme members was as follows:\n\n|                  | United Kingdom   | United Kingdom   | Ireland     | Ireland     | Canada      | Canada      |\n|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                  | 2022 Number      | 2021 Number      | 2022 Number | 2021 Number | 2022 Number | 2021 Number |\n| Deferred members | 39,843           | 41,816           | 2,200       | 2,402       | 344         | 382         |\n| Pensioners       | 40,501           | 39,907           | 982         | 861         | 1,261       | 1,276       |\n| Total members    | 80,344           | 81,723           | 3,182       | 3,263       | 1,605       | 1,658       |\n\nAll schemes are closed to future accrual. Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with additional future accrual for active members.\n\n## (i) UK schemes\n\nIn the UK, the Group operates three main pension schemes, the ASPS, the RAC Scheme which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011 and the FPPS, which was acquired as part of the Friends Life acquisition in 2015. As the defined benefit sections of the UK schemes are now closed to both new members and future accrual, existing deferred members in active service and new entrants participate in the defined contribution section of the ASPS. The UK schemes operate within the UK pensions' regulatory framework.\n\n## (ii) Other schemes\n\nIn Ireland, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the AISPF and the Friends First Group Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (FFPS) which was acquired as part of the Friends First acquisition in June 2018. Future accruals for the AISPF and FFPS schemes ceased with effect from 30 April 2013 and 1 April 2014 respectively. The Irish schemes are regulated by the Pensions Authority in Ireland.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has resulted in a reduction of the fair value of fixed income securities, not fully offset by the reduction in the valuation of the defined benefit obligation from the increase in the valuation interest rate. Further information on the sensitivity of the IAS 19 surplus to interest rates is provided in note 50(b)(iii).\n- \u00b7 During the period the ASPS completed two further bulk annuity buy-in transactions with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, a Group Company. Due to different measurement bases applying for accounting purposes, the premium paid by the scheme exceeded the valuation of the scheme asset recognised. In the table above, this has been recognised as a loss in the actual return on assets (see note 61 Related party transactions for further information). The scheme assets recognised are transferable and so have not been subject to consolidation within the Group's financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Experience losses on the pension schemes' liabilities which includes the impact of higher than expected inflation increases.\n- \u00b7 The losses were partially offset by actuarial gains relating to updated demographic assumptions (including longevity assumptions).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where the investments are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in 'Cash and other'. There are no significant judgements involved in the valuation of the scheme assets. Insurance policies are valued on the same basis as the pension scheme liabilities, as required by IAS 19.\n\n## (iii) Assumptions on scheme liabilities\n\nThe valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent funding actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the standard's requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2022\n\n## The projected unit credit method\n\nThe inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis. This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method. This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings. It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the UK schemes relevant RPI/CPI swap curves are used; the rate shown is the equivalent single RPI rate for ASPS. In 2022, CPI is derived as RPI less 100 bps pre 2030 and RPI less 0bps post 2030 (2021: RPI less 80 bps pre 2030 and RPI less 0bps post 2030).\n- 2. In the UK, the only remaining linkage between pension benefits and general salary increases is in respect of a small amount of Guaranteed Minimum Pension benefits, in line with National Average Earnings\n- 3. For the UK schemes relevant RPI/CPI swap curves are used, adjusted to reflect the appropriate caps/floors and the inflation volatility. The rates shown are the single equivalent rates for the biggest groups of pensions in payment and deferment respectively in the ASPS. The rates shown are for future indexation and so include allowance for the impact of known inflation experience that falls within the reference period for pension and deferred pension increases due in 2023.\n- 4. To calculate scheme liabilities in the UK, a discount rate of 4.81 % is used for ASPS, 4.80 % for RAC and 4.78 % for FPPS members not included in annuity policies held by the scheme. A discount rate of 4.79 % is used for ASPS members and 4.82 % for FPPS members included in annuity policies held by the scheme. The different rates reflect the differences in the duration of the liabilities between the schemes.\n- 5. For the Irish schemes, a discount rate of 3.65 % and 3.60 % is used for AISPF and FFPS respectively, reflecting the differences in the duration of the liabilities between the two schemes.\n\nThe discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate. For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.\n\n## Mortality assumptions\n\nMortality assumptions are material in measuring the Group's obligations under its defined benefit schemes.

The tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience. However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption. For the ASPS, which is the most material scheme to the Group, the allowance for mortality improvement is per the actuarial profession's CMI\\_2021 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments model (2021: CMI\\_2019 (S=7.25) Advanced with adjustments), with a long-term improvement rate of 1.50 % (2021: 1.50 %) for males and 1.50 % (2021: 1.50 %) for females. The CMI\\_2021 tables have been adjusted to allow for greater mortality improvements in the annuitant population relative to the general population on which CMI\\_2021 is based by setting 'Parameter A' to 0.15 % per annum for males and 0.20 % per annum for females (2021: Parameter A was set to 0.15 % per annum for males and 0.20 % per annum for females), and uses the core parameters to taper the long-term improvement rates to zero between ages 85 and 110 (2021: advanced parameters were used to taper the long-term improvement rates to zero between ages 90 and 115).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Movements in the defined benefit obligation are mitigated by the impact on the assets from economic movements including interest rates and price inflation, as well as the longevity sensitivity impact due to the insurance policy and longevity swap assets held by the UK pension schemes. The sensitivity analysis below has been determined by changing the respective assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant.

The effect of assuming all members in the schemes were one year younger\n\nIt is unlikely that the changes in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\n## Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation\n\nDue to the increase of the discount rate over the period, the average duration of the discounted liabilities has reduced in each scheme. The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 13 years (2021: 17 years) in ASPS, 15 years (2021: 19 years) in FPPS, 14 years (2021: 18 years) in the RAC scheme, 15 years (2021: 19 years) in AISPF, 23 years (2021: 26 years) in FFPS and 9 years (2021: 11 years) in the Canadian scheme. The expected undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme, ASPS, is shown in the chart below:\n\n## Undiscounted benefit payments (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (iv) Risk management and asset allocation strategy\n\nThe investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long-term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes. To meet these objectives, the schemes' assets are invested in a portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities as detailed in section (b)(ii). The investment strategy continues to evolve over time and is expected to match the liability profile closely with swap overlays to improve interest rate and inflation matching. The schemes are generally matched to interest rate risk relative to the funding bases.\n\n## Main UK scheme\n\nThe Company works closely with the trustee, who is required to consult with the Company on the investment strategy.\n\nInterest rate and inflation rate risks are managed using a combination of liability-matching assets and swaps. Exposure to equity risk has been reducing over time and credit risk is managed within risk appetite. Currency risk is relatively small and is largely hedged. The other principal risk is longevity risk. This risk has reduced due to the ASPS entering into a longevity swap in 2014 covering approximately \u00a33.5 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.\n\nSince October 2019 the ASPS has completed seven bulk annuity buy-in transactions with Aviva Life & Pensions UK Limited, a Group Company. These transactions have covered approximately \u00a32.9 billion of liabilities related to deferred pensioners and current pensioners, removing the investment and longevity risk for these members from the scheme.\n\n## Other schemes\n\nThe other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme. In 2015, the RAC pension scheme entered into a longevity swap covering approximately \u00a30.4 billion of pensioner in payment scheme liabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The assumptions adopted for triennial actuarial valuations are determined by the trustees and agreed with the Group and are normally more prudent than the assumptions adopted for IAS 19 purposes, which are best estimate.\n\nFor the ASPS, the latest formal actuarial valuation was completed with an effective date of 31 March 2021 and showed that the ASPS was fully funded on its technical provisions basis consistent with the requirements of the UK pension regulations.\n\nOther than small amounts to meet some administrative expenses and death benefits, and deficit contributions in Canada, there are no employer contributions expected in 2023.\n\n## (c) Defined contribution (money purchase) section of the ASPS\n\nThe trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds. Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their risk appetite and their retirement plans. Members of this section contribute at least 2 % of their pensionable salaries, and depending on the percentage chosen, the Group contributes up to a maximum 14 %, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits. These contribution rates remained unchanged until June 2017. From 1 July 2017, for every 1 % additional employee contribution, the Group will contribute an additional 0.1 % employer contribution.

The risk allowances are consistent with those used in the fair value asset methodology, as described in note 22. These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.

These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes. However, the actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ, for example because experience may be worse than that assumed, or future general insurance business claims inflation may differ from that expected, and hence there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.\n\n## Business Interruption\n\nThe removal of the majority of government restrictions related to COVID-19 across the Group's markets has led to claims frequency increasing to and stabilising at more normal levels, but there continues to be a significant degree of uncertainty in relation to business interruption claims arising from COVID-19.\n\nOn 17 October 2022, the High Court handed down its judgment on the preliminary issues trial of Stonegate Pub Co Ltd vs MS Amlin Corp Member Ltd (and others) and related cases. Aviva was not a party to the cases but will be affected by the final rulings. The Court ruled in favour of the parties on different issues, and all parties have appealed the majority of the decisions. The judgment has been carefully considered and the potential impact on claims related to business interruption policies assessed, noting that significant uncertainty remains due to the appeals made to the Court of Appeal.\n\nIn Canada, we are party to a number of litigation proceedings challenging coverage under certain policies; however, we believe we have a strong argument that there is no pandemic coverage under these policies. In the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been established for such claims based on information available at the reporting date. The Group purchases reinsurance protection on its property portfolio that includes coverage for business interruption and is collecting or seeking reinsurance recoveries of business interruption losses that are covered by reinsurance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 54 - Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued\n\nFor further information on our general insurance risk management see note 58(f).\n\n## (b) Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards\n\nIn the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards. Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in the UK, Ireland and Canada. Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty. However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims and substantial reinsurance cover now in place, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.\n\n## (c) Guarantees on long-term savings products\n\nAs a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and investment products. Note 44 gives details of these guarantees and options. Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level. The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.\n\n## (d) Regulatory compliance\n\nThe Group's insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates. A number of the Group's UK subsidiaries are dual regulated (directly authorised by both the PRA (for prudential regulation) and the FCA (for conduct regulation)) while others are solo regulated (regulated solely by the FCA for both prudential and conduct regulation). Between them, the PRA and FCA have broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firm's authorisation; to investigate marketing and sales practices; and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.\n\nThe Group's regulated businesses have compliance resources to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and take corrective action when warranted. However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.\n\nThe impact of any such finding (whether in the UK or overseas) could have a negative impact on the Group's reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers. Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results, operations and/ or financial condition and divert management's attention from the day-to-day management of the business.\n\n## (e) Structured settlements\n\nThe Group has purchased annuities from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants. As a result of these arrangements, the Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk for these types of arrangements is approximately \u00a3641 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3807 million) . Credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability. This risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the Canadian life insurance industry compensation plan. As at 31 December 2022, no information has come to the Group's attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in life insurers from which it has purchased annuities and consequently no provision for credit risk is required.\n\n## (f) Other\n\nIn the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation. In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.\n\nIn addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group. In the opinion of the directors, no material unprovisioned loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.\n\nThere are a number of charges registered over the assets of Group companies in favour of other Group companies or third parties. In addition, certain of the Company's assets are charged in favour of certain of its subsidiaries as security for intra-Group loans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

See note 21 for further information on lease commitments.\n\nContractual commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures of infrastructure loans, equity funds, investment property and property and equipment, which have not been recognised in the financial statements, are as follows:\n\n|                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Infrastructure loan advances | 384       | 628       |\n| Investment property          | 361       | 507       |\n| Property and equipment       | 70        | 45        |\n| Other investment vehicles\u00b9   | 246       | 138       |\n|                              | 1,061     | 1,318     |\n\nNotes 17 and 18 set out the commitments the Group has to its joint ventures and associates.\n\n## 56 - Group capital management\n\n## (a) Group capital\n\nThe Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory it operates in. At a Group level, we have to comply with the requirements established by the PRA.\n\nThe Group Solvency II capital requirements are calculated using a Partial Internal Model (PIM) which assesses the risks on an Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The Solvency II capital regime requires insurers to calculate regulatory capital adequacy at both individual regulated subsidiaries and an aggregate Group level. Non-UK entities have been included in Group solvency in line with Solvency II requirements. Other financial sector entities (including fund management) are included at their proportional share of the capital requirement according to the relevant sectoral values. In addition, non-UK businesses including Canada, are subject to the locally applicable capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nGroup capital is represented by Solvency II own funds. The Solvency II position disclosed is based on a 'shareholder view'. The shareholder view is considered by management to be more representative of the shareholders' risk exposure and the Group's ability to cover the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) with eligible own funds and aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position.\n\nIn arriving at the shareholder position, the following adjustments are typically made to the regulatory Solvency II own funds:\n\n- \u00b7 The contribution to the Group's SCR and own funds of the most material fully ring fenced with-profits funds of \u00a31,369 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a32,205 million) and staff pension schemes in surplus of \u00a3394 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a31,218 million) are excluded. These exclusions have no impact on Solvency II surplus as these funds are self-supporting on a Solvency II capital basis with any surplus capital above SCR not recognised;\n- \u00b7 A notional reset of the transitional measure on technical provisions (TMTP), calculated using the same method as used for formal TMTP resets. This presentation avoids step changes to the Solvency II position that arise only when the formal TMTP reset points are triggered. The 31 December 2022 Solvency II position includes a notional reset (\u00a3437 million decrease in own funds) (an application for a formal reset has been submitted to the regulator and will be reflected in our regulatory position once approved) while the 31 December 2021 Solvency II position included a formal, rather than notional, reset of the TMTP in line with the regulatory requirement to reset the TMTP at least every two years and hence no adjustment was required. In addition, due to interest rate rises over the period, a formal reset of TMTP as at 30 June 2022 was approved and is included in the estimated 31 December 2022 regulatory Solvency II position;\n\n|                                                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Estimated Solvency II regulatory own funds as at 31 December | 18,668    | 25,573    |\n| Adjustments for:                                             |           |           |\n| Fully ring-fenced with-profits funds                         | (1,369)   | (2,205)   |\n| Staff pension schemes in surplus                             | (394)     | (1,218)   |\n| Notional reset of TMTP                                       | (437)     | -         |\n| Estimated Solvency II shareholder own funds at 31 December   | 16,468    | 22,150    |\n\nSolvency II own funds are comprised of a combination of shareholders' funds, preference share capital, subordinated debt, and deferred tax assets measured on a Solvency II basis. During the year, the Group redeemed \u00a31 billion of subordinated debt (see note 51) and issued \u00a30.5 billion of of Restricted Tier 1 subordinated debt .\n\nSolvency II surplus at the Group level represents the excess of eligible Solvency II own funds over the Group's solvency capital requirements calculated in accordance with Solvency II requirements. The Group maintained capital in excess of the SCR at all times during 2022. All regulated subsidiaries complied with their capital requirements throughout the year, with the exception of a temporary breach in a small entity in Canada where solvency coverage was promptly restored.\n\nFurther information on the Group's Solvency II position, shareholder view, including a reconciliation between IFRS equity and own funds can be found in the Other information section. This information is estimated and is therefore subject to change. It is also unaudited.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 56 - Group capital management continued\n\n## (b) Risks and capital management objectives\n\nThe primary objective of capital management is to maintain an efficient capital structure, in a manner consistent with our risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business. Capital is a primary consideration across a wide range of business activities, including product development, pricing, business planning, merger and acquisition transactions and asset and liability management. A Capital Management Standard, applicable Group-wide, sets out minimum standards and guidelines over responsibility for capital management including considerations for capital management decisions and requirements for management information, capital monitoring, reporting, forecasting, planning and overall governance.\n\nThe Group manages capital in conjunction with solvency capital requirements and in line with the dividend policy and capital framework.\n\n- \u00b7 We aim to deliver sustainable dividends at a level that is resilient in times of stress and is covered by the capital and cash generated from our businesses;\n- \u00b7 At the core of our capital framework is financial strength in accordance with risk appetite and efficient deployment of capital. See note 58 for more information about the Group's risk management approach;\n- \u00b7 Key elements of our capital framework are as follows:\n- - Solvency II shareholder cover ratio working range of 160%-180%\n- - Centre liquid assets of c.\u00a31.5 billion\n- - Solvency II debt leverage ratio below 30%\n- - To maintain our AA credit rating metrics;\n- \u00b7 After the payment of our regular dividend, surplus capital is available for investment in the business to support growth and top quartile efficiency objectives, bolt-on M&A where this delivers attractive risk adjusted returns and the opportunity is in line with our strategy, and any additional returns to shareholders releasing excess capital over time;\n- \u00b7 The Group seeks to retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity, access to a range of capital markets and significant unutilised committed credit lines; and\n- \u00b7 Our businesses are capitalised based on their regulatory minimum levels with further prudent volatility buffers specific to each entity. Subsidiary capital appetites and working ranges are reviewed regularly by subsidiary boards.\n\n## Intra-group capital arrangements\n\nConsistent with our capital management framework, the Group has in place intra-group arrangements to provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries. In the normal course of business, the Group will provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries in certain circumstances. While the Group considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to its regulated subsidiaries and its policyholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also includes changes in the size and value of consolidated cash investment funds and changes in the Group participation in these funds.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We accept the risks inherent to our core business lines of life, general insurance and health, and asset management. We diversify these risks through our scale, geographic spread, the variety of the products and services we offer and the channels through which we sell them. We receive premiums which we invest to maximise risk-adjusted returns, so that we can fulfil our promises to customers while providing a return to our shareholders. In doing so we have a preference for retaining those risks we believe we are capable of managing to generate a return.\n\nOur sustainability and financial strength are underpinned by an effective risk management process and risk intelligent culture, which helps us identify major risks to which we may be exposed, establish appropriate controls and take mitigating actions for the benefit of our customers and investors. The Group's risk strategy is to invest its available capital to optimise the balance between return and risk while maintaining an appropriate level of economic (i.e. risk-based) and regulatory capital.\n\nThe key elements of our risk management framework comprise: our risk strategy and risk management forward plans; risk governance, including risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities; and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\n## Risk Environment\n\nDuring the year, the global economy has experienced elevated inflation, rising interest rates and stagnating economic growth. Expectations for 2023 are that interest rates will see further rises. The Bank of England expects the UK economy to be at risk to recession throughout 2023 and the first half 2024, with GDP expected to recover gradually thereafter. This will increase the risk of credit defaults and rating downgrades, which we are monitoring closely . Affordability remains a concern to trading because of the economic climate, and will impact all customers, including relatively affluent customers. Customer experience and retention will continue to require close monitoring. Continued heightened geo-political tensions, specifically over the conflict in Ukraine, and the potential for further disruption to energy supplies are an additional source of uncertainty for financial and commodity markets and as a trigger for inflation.\n\nThere remains uncertainty over the outcome from continuing COVID-19 business interruption claims litigation and the impact on the Group, as well as the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality and morbidity, and consequential strains on UK public healthcare and customer demand for private medical insurance.\n\nWe expect continued and heightened regulatory change in 2023 and beyond. In 2023 the UK Government and PRA are expected to conclude their review of Solvency II impacting how much prudential capital the Group is required to hold and how the Group invests the funds backing its annuity business. By July 2023, the Group's UK business will be required to have implemented the FCA's Consumer Duty for open products and by July 2024 for closed products. The FCA Consumer Duty, combined with the cost of living crisis, is expected to increase regulatory scrutiny on the fair value of products provided by the insurance industry. August 2023 will see the first wave of large pension providers and schemes connecting to the UK pensions dashboard.\n\nThe Group continues to maintain strong solvency and liquidity positions through a range of scenarios and stress testing. Our capital and liquidity positions have been tested by recent market conditions and have been shown to be robust and resilient.\n\nThere has been an increased threat of malware and ransomware attacks across the world. In response we have increased the protection level of anti-malware security controls. We continue to monitor threat intelligence data and update our security controls to maintain protection against new and emerging ransomware variants.\n\nAviva remains committed to supporting a low carbon economy that will improve the resilience of our economy, society and the financial system in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement target on climate change. In March 2021, we set an ambition to become a Net Zero carbon company by 2040 and we are acting now to mitigate and manage the impact of climate change on our business. We calculate a Climate Value at Risk (VaR) against Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios to assess the climate-related risks and opportunities under different emission projections and associated temperature pathways. A range of different financial indicators are used to assess the impact on our investments and insurance liabilities. As part of our actions to mitigate climate risks, Aviva originates assets for their climate credentials. Aviva has defined an Investment in Sustainable assets metric, which is implemented with reference to external frameworks and is set out in our climate reporting policies in the Aviva plc Climate-related Financial Disclosure report 2022.\n\nThe Group is implementing IFRS 17 insurance contracts retrospectively from 1 January 2023. The adoption of IFRS 17 significantly impacts the measurement and presentation of the contracts in scope of the standard. IFRS 17 introduces the concept of a contractual service margin (CSM) liability that defers future unearned profit on insurance contracts. The recognition of a CSM for our life businesses is expected to result in a material reduction in the IFRS net asset value of the Group on transition to IFRS 17, with a stock of future profits held on the balance sheet as a liability and released over time. The cash flows and underlying capital generation of our businesses are unaffected by IFRS 17, and the standard will have no impact on our Solvency II performance metrics or the Group financial targets we have announced. Furthermore, we do not expect IFRS 17 to impact on the dividend policy and dividend guidance. Further information on IFRS 17, including the expected financial impacts on the Group net asset value at the transition date of 1 January 2022, is provided in note 62.\n\n## (a) Risk management framework (RMF)\n\nAviva's RMF is at the heart of every business decision and is key to a robust control environment and the Group's sustainable success. The key components of our RMF are risk appetite; risk governance, including risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities; and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing. A risk taxonomy is maintained for a consistent approach to risk identification, measurement and reporting, and to determine application of the Group Risk Appetite Framework and the risks for which a Risk Policy is required. The taxonomy is arranged in a hierarchy with more granular risk types grouped into the following principal risk categories: credit and market, liquidity, life insurance, general insurance (including health), operational and strategic risk. Risks falling within these types may affect a number of outcomes including those relating to solvency, liquidity, profit, reputation and conduct.\n\nTo promote a consistent and rigorous approach to risk management across all businesses we have a set of risk policies and business standards which set out the risk strategy/forward plan, appetite, framework, key controls, and minimum requirements for the Group's worldwide operations. The business unit's chief executive officers make an annual declaration supported by an opinion from the business unit chief risk officers that the system of governance and internal controls was effective and fit for purpose for their business throughout the year.\n\nThe Group's Risk Appetite Framework was refreshed during the year, with revised and new risk appetites, preferences and tolerances considered and approved by the Risk Committee. Climate Risk was integrated and defined within the risk appetite framework to be incorporated into risk-based decision-making.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nA regular top-down key risk identification and assessment process is carried out by the Risk function. This includes the consideration of emerging risks and is supported by deeper thematic reviews. This process is replicated at the business unit level. The risk assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.\n\nRisk models are an important tool in our measurement of risks and are used to support the monitoring and reporting of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available. We carry out a range of stress (where one risk factor, such as equity returns, is assumed to vary) and scenario (where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary) tests to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged. For those risk types managed through the holding of capital, being our principal risk types except for liquidity risk, we measure and monitor our risk profile based on the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR).\n\nRoles and responsibilities for risk management in Aviva are based around the 'three lines of defence' risk governance model where ownership for risk is taken at all levels in the Group. Line management in the business is accountable for risk ownership and management, including the implementation and embedding of the RMF. The risk function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge of the risk identification, measurement, monitoring, management, and reporting processes and for developing the RMF, as well as providing advisory support to the business on risk innovation. Internal audit provides an independent assessment of the risk management framework and internal control processes.\n\nBoard oversight of risk and its management across the Group is maintained on a regular basis through its Risk Committee and Customer and Sustainability Committee. The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take. Three Group-level management committees (Group Executive Risk Committee, Group Asset Liability Committee and the Disclosure Committee) exist to assist members of the Aviva Executive Committee in the discharge of their delegated authorities and their accountabilities within the Aviva Governance Framework and in relation to their defined regulatory responsibilities.\n\nIn September 2022, we acquired an additional 25% stake in our joint venture in India, Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited, increasing Aviva's shareholding to 74%. As a result of this transaction, we became the majority shareholder and have applied the Aviva RMF to this business.\n\nThe RMF of a small number of our joint ventures and strategic equity holdings differs from the Aviva RMF outlined in this note. We work with these entities to understand how their risks are managed and to align them, where possible, with Aviva's RMF so not to unduly increase the overall risk exposure of the Group.\n\nThe types of risks to which the Group is exposed have not changed significantly during the year and remain credit, market, liquidity, life insurance, general insurance and health, asset management and operational risks. These risks are described below.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to Aviva, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks. Credit risk is taken so that Aviva can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders. In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, because of the better expected risk adjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.\n\nOur approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements. Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security investments, structured asset investments, bank deposits, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance counterparties.\n\nThe Group manages its credit risk at business unit and Group level. All business units are required to implement credit risk management processes (including limits frameworks), operate specific risk management committees, and report and monitor their exposures against detailed pre-established risk criteria. At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate a Group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.\n\nThe Group has minimal direct investment exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and no exposure to Belarus.\n\nWe did not experience a material increase in credit defaults in 2022. We continue to monitor closely any deterioration in the credit markets. Our capital position includes an allowance for the expected potential impacts from downgrades and defaults.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The carrying values of these assets are disclosed in the relevant notes: financial investments (note 26), reinsurance assets (note 45), loans (note 23) and receivables (note 27). The collateral in place for these credit exposures is disclosed in note 60 Financial assets and liabilities subject to offsetting, enforceable master netting agreements and similar agreements.\n\n## (ii) Other investments\n\nOther investments include unit trusts and other investment vehicles; derivative financial instruments, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements; and other assets, including deposits with credit institutions and minority holdings in property management undertakings.\n\nThe credit quality of the underlying debt securities within investment vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment mandates for these funds which determine the funds' risk profiles. At the Group level, we also monitor the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles against Group set limits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nA proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable. Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall appetite for market risk.\n\n## (iii) Loans\n\nThe Group loan portfolio principally comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy;\n- \u00b7 Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions. These loans are fully collateralised by other securities;\n- \u00b7 Healthcare, infrastructure and PFI loans secured against healthcare, education, social housing and emergency services related premises; and\n- \u00b7 Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.\n\nWe use loan to value, interest and debt service cover, and diversity and quality of the tenant base metrics to internally monitor our exposures to mortgage loans. We use credit quality, based on dynamic market measures, and collateralisation rules to manage our stock lending activities. Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.\n\n## (iv) Credit concentration risk\n\nThe long-term and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations applicable in most markets and the Group credit policy and limits framework, which limit investments in individual assets and asset classes. Credit concentrations are monitored as part of the regular credit monitoring process and are reported to the Group Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). With the exception of government bonds the largest aggregated counterparty exposure within shareholder assets is to the Legal and General Group plc (including subsidiaries), representing approximately 1.7% of the total shareholder assets.\n\n## (v) Reinsurance credit exposures\n\nThe Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings. The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer. Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite. The Group Capital and Group Risk teams have an active monitoring role with escalation to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Risk Officer (CRO), Group ALCO and the Board Risk Committee as appropriate.\n\n## (vi) Securities finance\n\nThe Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK and smaller operations in some other businesses. The risks within this activity are mitigated by collateralisation and minimum counterparty credit quality requirements.\n\n## (vii) Derivative credit exposures\n\nThe Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades. This risk is generally mitigated through holding collateral for most trades. Residual exposures are captured within the Group's credit management framework.\n\n## (viii) Unit-linked business\n\nIn unit-linked business the policyholder bears the direct market risk and credit risk on investment assets in the unit funds and the shareholders' exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent of the income arising from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.\n\n## (ix) Impairment of financial assets\n\nIn assessing whether financial assets carried at amortised cost or classified as available for sale are impaired, due consideration is given to the factors outlined in accounting policies (T) and (V). The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets subject to impairment testing that have been impaired and the ageing of those assets that are past due but not impaired. The table excludes assets carried at fair value through profit or loss and held for sale.\n\n|                                        | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   | Financial assets that are past due but not impaired   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2022                 | Neither past due nor impaired \u00a3m                      | 0-3 months \u00a3m                                         | 3-6 months \u00a3m                                         | 6 months- 1 year \u00a3m                                   | Greater than 1 year \u00a3m                                | Financial assets that have been impaired \u00a3m           | Carrying value \u00a3m                                     |\n| Fixed maturity securities              | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     |\n| Reinsurance assets                     | 7,832                                                 | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | 7,832                                                 |\n| Other investments                      | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     |\n| Loans                                  | 3,727                                                 | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | -                                                     | 3,727                                                 |\n| Receivables and other financial assets | 5,778                                                 | 133                                                   | 71                                                    | 26                                                    | 35                                                    | -                                                     | 6,043                                                 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.\n\n## (c) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse financial impact resulting, directly or indirectly from fluctuations in interest rates, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices. Market risk arises in business units because of fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held. At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders. We actively seek some market risks as part of our investment and product strategy.\n\nThe management of market risk is undertaken at business unit and at Group level. Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints. Group Capital is responsible for monitoring and managing market risk at Group level and has established criteria for matching assets and liabilities to limit the impact of mismatches because of market movements.\n\nIn addition, where the Group's long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where most investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, so  to satisfy the policyholders' risk and reward objectives. The Group writes unit-linked business, primarily in the UK. The shareholders' exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.\n\nAviva launched a formal Group-wide programme of change activity in 2019 to manage the transition to alternative risk-free rates from LIBOR settings. Three sub programmes were established covering the UK insurance business, Aviva Investors and other Group activities, reporting into a Group Steering Committee. The majority of Aviva's exposure to IBOR rates existed within the UK insurance business and Aviva Investors, where Aviva has reviewed all financial instruments, engaged with counterparties to either transition to alternative risk-free rates or have exited positions where required. Significant progress has been made, with a substantive majority of Aviva's original IBOR exposure already resolved. Aviva's only remaining exposure to GBP LIBOR relates to a small number of currently fixed-rate public bonds that would revert to LIBOR-referencing floating rates in the event of a non-call by the issuer at the next call date. We continue to assess the likelihood of this event. Aviva has adhered to the ISDA Fallback Protocol for all its in-scope USD LIBOR exposures and we continue to work with borrowers on the transition of our remaining direct USD LIBOR loan exposures in advance of the discontinuation of these benchmarks after 30 June 2023. Aviva's exposure to CDOR relates to a small number of interest rate swaps whose transition will be planned prior to CDOR's termination after 28th June 2024. Aviva has worked closely with UK regulators, impacted clients, industry experts and industry associations to ensure a smooth and transparent transition of the exposures. The programme continues to address all risks posed by the transition, including the risk of non-transition of outstanding exposures. No change to the Company's risk management strategy has been required in response to the transition. At 30 December 2022, \u00a3506 million of non-derivative financial assets, \u00a329 million of derivative financial assets and \u00a330 million of derivative financial liabilities had yet to transition to an alternative risk-free rate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nThe most material types of market risk that the Group is exposed to are described below.\n\n## (i) Equity price risk\n\nThe Group is subject to direct equity price risk arising from changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio. Our most material indirect equity price risk exposures are to policyholder unit-linked funds, which are exposed to a fall in the value of the fund thereby reducing the fees we earn on those funds, and participating contracts, which are exposed to a fall in the value of the funds thereby increasing our costs for policyholder guarantees. We also have some equity exposure in shareholder funds through equities held to match inflation-linked liabilities.\n\nWe continue to limit our direct equity exposure in line with our risk preferences. At a business unit level, investment limits and local investment regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities. The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.\n\nEquity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options. Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of risk models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates. An equity hedging strategy remains in place to help control the Group's overall direct and indirect exposure to equities.\n\nSensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section (h) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (ii) Property price risk\n\nThe Group is subject to property price risk directly because of holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide and indirectly through investments in mortgages and mortgage backed securities. Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and is subject to local regulations on investments, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices. We maintain a conservative loan-to-value on our commercial mortgage portfolio. Exposure to property risk on equity release mortgages from sustained underperformance in the UK House Price Index (HPI) is mitigated by capping loan to value on origination at low levels and regularly monitoring the performance of the mortgage portfolio.\n\nSensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section (h) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from the Group's investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities. A number of policyholder product features have an influence on the Group's interest rate risk. The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values. Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 44.\n\nWe have limited appetite for interest rate risk as we do not believe it is adequately rewarded. We manage and hedge our interest rate exposure through setting risk tolerance levels on a Solvency II cover ratio basis. Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.\n\nIncreasing interest rates as a result of the monetary policy response to inflationary pressures will positively impact the Group's regulatory capital cover ratio. This could be offset by the negative impact of credit downgrades, counterparty defaults, claims and maintenance expenses and lapse rates if high inflation persists and the economy stagnates or falls. Conversely, rising credit spreads will adversely impact IFRS shareholders' equity, see section (h) sensitivity test analysis.\n\nThe Group typically manages interest rate risk by investing in fixed interest securities which closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities where such investments are available. In particular, a key objective is to at least match the duration of our annuity liabilities with assets of the same duration, and in some cases where appropriate cash flow matching has been used. These assets include corporate bonds, residential mortgages and commercial mortgages. Should they default before maturity, it is assumed that the Group can reinvest in assets of a similar risk and return profile, which is subject to market conditions. Interest rate risk is also managed in some business units using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors.\n\nOther product lines of the Group, such as protection, are not significantly sensitive to interest rate or market movements. For unit-linked business, the shareholder margins emerging are typically a mixture of annual management fees and risk/expense charges. Risk and expense margins are largely unaffected by low interest rates. Annual management fees could increase if there was a move towards low interest rates which increases the value of unit funds. For the UK annuities business interest rate exposure is mitigated by closely matching the duration of liabilities with assets of the same duration.\n\nSome of the Group's products in UK and Ireland, principally participating contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will impact on profits through a change in the interest spread (the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts and the investment income we are able to earn on the investments supporting our obligations under those contracts). The UK participating business includes contracts with features such as guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values. These liabilities are managed through duration matching of assets and liabilities and the use of derivatives, including swaptions. As a result, the Group's exposure to sustained low interest rates on this portfolio is not material. Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 44.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nProfit before tax on General Insurance and Health Insurance business is generally a mixture of insurance, expense and investment returns. The asset portfolio is invested primarily in fixed income securities. The portfolio investment yield and average total invested assets in our general insurance and health business are set out in the table below.\n\n|      | Portfolio investment yield\u00b9   | Average assets \u00a3m   |\n|------|-------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 2020 | 1.88 %                        | 15,024              |\n| 2021 | 1.88 %                        | 14,390              |\n| 2022 | 2.33 %                        | 13,082              |\n\nThe nature of the business means that prices in certain circumstances can be increased to maintain overall profitability. This is subject to the competitive environment in each market. If there are future falls in interest rates the investment yield would be expected to decrease in future periods.\n\nSensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section (h) Risk and capital management, below.\n\n## (iv) Inflation risk\n\nInflation risk arises primarily from the Group's exposure to general insurance claims inflation, to inflation linked benefits within the defined benefit staff pension schemes and within the UK annuity portfolio and to expense inflation. Increases in long-term inflation expectations are closely linked to long-term interest rates and so are frequently considered with interest rate risk. Exposure to inflation risk is monitored through capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing. The Group typically manages inflation risk through its investment strategy and, in particular, by investing in inflation linked securities and through a variety of derivative instruments, including inflation linked swaps. Inflation risk is a rising concern and we are monitoring the potential impact on the profits and margins of the Group and our counterparties which could impact their credit quality.\n\n## (v) Currency risk\n\nThe Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profits contract liabilities or are hedged. As a result the foreign exchange gains and losses on investments are largely offset by changes in unit-linked and with-profits liabilities and fair value changes in derivatives attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. Approximately 25% of the Group's gross written premium income from continuing operations arises in currencies other than sterling. The Group's net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are sterling, euro and Canadian dollars (CAD$). The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements. However, the Group does use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge planned dividends from its subsidiaries.\n\nBusinesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the Group's consolidated shareholders' equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set. Except where the Group has applied net investment hedge accounting (see note 59(a)), foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency borrowings are recognised in the income statement, whereas foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation from the translation of assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income. At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group's net assets by currency including assets held for sale was:\n\n|                                | Sterling \u00a3m   | Euro \u00a3m   |   CAD$ \u00a3m |   Other \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Net Assets at 31 December 2022 | 12,806        | (507)     |        12 |        584 | 12,895     |\n| Net Assets at 31 December 2021 | 19,300        | (769)     |       222 |        701 | 19,454     |\n\nA 10% change in sterling to euro/CAD$ period-end foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on net assets:\n\n|                                |   10% increase in  sterling/euro  rate \u00a3m | 10% decrease  in sterling/euro  rate \u00a3m   | 10% increase in  sterling/CAD$  rate \u00a3m   |   10% decrease  in sterling/ CAD$ rate \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Net assets at 31 December 2022 |                                        51 | (51)                                      | (1)                                       |                                         1 |\n| Net assets at 31 December 2021 |                                        77 | (77)                                      | (22)                                      |                                        22 |\n\nA 10% change in sterling to euro/$ average foreign exchange rates applied to translate foreign currency profits would have had the following impact on profit before tax, including resulting gains and losses on foreign exchange hedges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These balance sheet movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit. Net asset and profit before tax figures are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities.\n\n## (vi) Derivatives risk\n\nDerivatives are used by a number of the businesses. Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes, or to structure specific retail savings products. Activity is overseen by the Group Capital and Group Risk teams, which monitor exposure levels and approve large or complex transactions.\n\nThe Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.\n\n## (vii) Correlation risk\n\nThe Group recognises that lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates. These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the internal capital model and in scenario analysis.\n\n## (d) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. The relatively illiquid nature of insurance liabilities is a potential source of additional investment return by allowing us to invest in higher yielding, and less liquid assets such as commercial mortgages and infrastructure loans. The Group seeks to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due through the application of a Group liquidity risk policy and business standard and through the development of its liquidity risk management plan. At Group and business unit level, there is a liquidity risk appetite which requires that sufficient liquid resources be maintained to cover net outflows in a stress scenario. In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Group maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities (\u00a31,700 million) from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.\n\nIn the Group we use derivative contracts to manage interest rate, inflation and foreign-exchange risks. Following the sharp and rapid rise in interest rates at the end of Q3 2022 the value of these instruments moved significantly. This required sizeable collateral flows which we were able to meet due to the sufficient liquidity buffers and intergroup funding.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nThe following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance assets held to meet them. A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and non-hedge derivatives is given in notes 51 and 59, respectively. Contractual obligations under leases and capital commitments are given in note 21 and note 55.\n\n## (i) Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities\n\nFor non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2022 and 2021 analysed by remaining duration. The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.\n\nAlmost all linked business and non-linked investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand. For such contracts, the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability. However, we expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and accordingly tables below reflect the expected cash flows for these contracts, rather than their contractual maturity date.\n\n| As at 31 December 2022            | Total \u00a3m   | On demand or  within 1 year \u00a3m   | 1-5 years \u00a3m   | 5-15 years \u00a3m   | Over 15 years \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Long-term business                |            |                                  |                |                 |                    |\n| Insurance contracts - non-linked  | 74,790     | 6,158                            | 19,972         | 30,507          | 18,153             |\n| Investment contracts - non-linked | 15,138     | 2,526                            | 4,517          | 6,492           | 1,603              |\n| Linked business                   | 152,374    | 5,027                            | 17,719         | 48,042          | 81,586             |\n| General insurance and health      | 16,382     | 6,785                            | 7,330          | 2,017           | 250                |\n| Total contract liabilities        | 258,684    | 20,496                           | 49,538         | 87,058          | 101,592            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the 'On demand or within 1 year' column. Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument. The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis. The first repricing and call date is normally ten years or more after the date of issuance. Most of the Group's investments in equity securities and fixed maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice.\n\n## (e) Life insurance risk\n\nLife insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality risk and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels, exercising of policyholder options and management and administration expenses.\n\nThe Group chooses to take measured amounts of life insurance risk provided that the relevant business has the appropriate core skills to assess and price the risk and adequate returns are available. The Group's underwriting strategy and appetite is communicated via specific policy statements, related business standards and guidelines. Life insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at the Group level.\n\nThe overall impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions of our life insurance risks, primarily longevity, persistency, mortality, morbidity and expense risk has been limited. The Group also tracks the potential longer-term impacts from the pandemic (e.g. morbidity impacts). Underwriting procedures on Individual Life Protection products limit our exposure to cohorts of the population at the highest risk of COVID-19.\n\nWe have reinsurance in place across all our businesses to reduce our net exposure to potential losses. In the UK we have extensive quota share reinsurance in place on Individual Protection business and for UK Group Life Protection we use surplus reinsurance for very large individual claims.\n\nThe Group's life insurance risk continues to be dominated by exposure from our UK business. COVID-19 has continued to present additional uncertainty, but we expect limited future impact to our business. We have seen heavier mortality throughout the summer months of 2022, which is in contrast to the historical trend of lighter experience over this period, with causes attributed to reduced NHS capacity and longterm health impairments prior to the pandemic.\n\nCurrent persistency experience is not showing any significant deterioration in the short term, despite cost of living pressures, but there remains some uncertainty about the potential for future deterioration, which is being monitored closely. External factors that may impact future persistency experience include the continued increasing levels of inflation, increased stock-market volatility, changes in legislation and the growing threat of a prolonged recession in the markets in which we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nWe are exposed to longevity risk through the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, to which our economic exposure has been reduced since 2014 by entering into a longevity swap covering the majority of pensioner in-payment scheme liabilities in force at the time. We purchase reinsurance for some of the longevity risk relating to our annuity business, which includes a series of bulk annuity buy-in transactions with the Aviva Staff Pension scheme, where a further tranche was executed in 2022 (see note 50). The Group has continued to write considerable volumes of life protection business, and to utilise reinsurance to reduce exposure to potential losses. More generally, life insurance risks are believed to provide a significant diversification against other risks in the portfolio. Life insurance risks are modelled within the internal capital model and are subject to sensitivity and stress and scenario testing.\n\nThe assumption setting and management of life insurance risks is governed by the Group-wide business standards covering underwriting, pricing, product design and management, in-force management, claims handling, and reinsurance. The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Mortality and morbidity risks are managed through comprehensive medical underwriting, input and advice from medical experts, as well as frequent monitoring and analysis of company experience. Reinsurance treaties are in place to provide further mitigation.\n- \u00b7 Longevity risk is managed through monitoring and analysis of the Group's experience, as well as considering the latest external industry data and emerging trends. While individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and any associated capital implications. The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.\n- \u00b7 Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, and benchmarking against local market information. Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed. Lapses and their associated financial impact are reduced through appropriate design of products to meet current and, where possible, future customer needs. Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve the retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.\n- \u00b7 Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through robust cost controls and efficiency targets, together with frequent monitoring of expense levels.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of changes in policyholder behaviour due to the exercise of options, guarantees and other product features embedded in its long-term savings products. These product features offer policyholders varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms. The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units and exposes Aviva to changes in policyholder behaviour in the exercise of options as well as market risk.\n\nExamples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are:\n\n- \u00b7 Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.\n- \u00b7 Guarantees: embedded floor (guaranteed return), maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment and the 'no negative equity' associated with the Equity Release business; and\n- \u00b7 Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.\n\nThe impact of these is reflected in the capital model and managed as part of the asset liability framework. Further disclosure on financial guarantees and options embedded in contracts and their inclusion in insurance and investment contract liabilities is provided in note 43.\n\n## (f) General insurance risk and health risk\n\nThe Group writes a balanced portfolio of general insurance risk (including personal motor; household; commercial motor; property and liability), as well as global exposure to corporate specialty risks. This risk is taken on, in line with our underwriting and pricing expertise, to provide an appropriate level of return for an acceptable level of risk. Underwriting discipline and a robust governance process is at the core of the Group's underwriting strategy.\n\nThe Group's health insurance business (including private health insurance, critical illness cover, income protection and personal accident insurance, as well as a range of corporate healthcare products) exposes the Group to morbidity risk (the proportion of our customers falling sick) and medical expense inflation.\n\nProvisions made for insurance liabilities are inherently uncertain. Due to this uncertainty, general and health insurance reserves are regularly reviewed by qualified and experienced actuaries at the business unit and Group level in accordance with the Group's reserving framework. These and other key risks, including the occurrence of unexpected claims from a single source or cause and inadequate reinsurance protection/risk transfer, are subject to an overarching risk management framework and various mechanisms to govern and control our risks and exposures.\n\nWe recognise that the severity and frequency of weather-related events has the potential to adversely impact provisions for insurance liabilities and our earnings, with the result that there is some seasonality in our results from period to period. Large catastrophic (CAT) losses arising as a result of these events are explicitly considered in our economic capital modelling to ensure we are resilient to such CAT scenarios. The impact of actual weather-related losses compared to the expected losses based on the long-term average was 12% worse (2021: 5% worse) for UK and Ireland general insurance and 35% lower (2021: 16% lower) for Canada general insurance.\n\nThe removal of the majority of government restrictions related to COVID-19 across the Group's markets has led to claims frequency increasing to and stabilising at more normal levels, but there continues to be a significant degree of uncertainty in relation to business interruption claims arising from COVID-19.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nOn 17 October 2022, the High Court in the UK handed down its judgment on the preliminary issues trial of Stonegate Pub Co Ltd vs MS Amlin Corp Member Ltd (and others) and related cases. Aviva was not a party to the cases but will be affected by the final rulings. The Court ruled in favour of the parties on different issues, and all parties have appealed the majority of the decisions. The judgment has been carefully considered and the potential impact on claims related to business interruption policies assessed, noting that significant uncertainty remains due to the appeals made to the Court of Appeal.\n\nIn Canada, we are party to a number of litigation proceedings, including class actions that challenge coverage under our commercial property policies; however, we believe we have a strong argument that there is no pandemic coverage under these policies. The Group purchases reinsurance protection on its property portfolio that includes coverage for business interruption and is collecting or seeking reinsurance recoveries of business interruption losses that are covered by reinsurance.\n\nThe Group's general insurance business does not have material underwriting exposure to Russia and the Ukraine, and does not conduct operations in the affected region. All commercial underwriting lines with exposures above \u00a31 million have been reviewed and all have clear war exclusions.\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine and ongoing disruption to global supply chains has resulted in heightened claims inflation during 2022 which is expected to persist into 2023 and has increased the uncertainty associated with the cost of settling general insurance claims. While the impacts of heightened claims inflation are being mitigated via new business pricing actions, our ability to price for inflation is dependent on market, competitor and customer behaviour. The time lag between premium earning and claims emergence means that some adverse impact on profitability is expected.\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nSignificant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group. The basis of these purchases is underpinned by analysis of capital, earnings and capital volatility, cash flow and liquidity and the Group's franchise value.\n\nDetailed actuarial analysis is used to calculate the Group's extreme risk profile and then design cost and capital efficient reinsurance programmes to mitigate these risks to within agreed appetites. For businesses writing general insurance we analyse the natural catastrophe exposure using our own internal probabilistic catastrophe model which is benchmarked against external catastrophe models widely used by the rest of the (re)insurance industry.\n\nThe Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third-party reinsurers through excess of loss and aggregate excess of loss structures. The Group purchases a Group-wide catastrophe reinsurance programme to protect against catastrophe losses up to a 1 in 250 year return period (1 in 500 year return period in Canada). The total Group potential retained loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure peril (Northern Europe Windstorm) is approximately \u00a3200 million on a per occurrence basis and \u00a3350 million on an annual aggregate basis. The Group purchases a number of general insurance business line specific reinsurance programmes with various retention levels to protect both capital and earnings, and has reinsured 100% of its latent exposures to its historic UK employers' liability and public liability business written prior to 31 December 2000.\n\n## (g) Operational risk (including conduct risk)\n\nOperational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events including changes in the regulatory environment. We have limited appetite for operational risk and aim to reduce these risks as far as is commercially sensible.\n\nThe Group continues to operate, validate and enhance its key operational controls and purchase insurance to minimise losses arising from inadequate or ineffective internal processes, people and systems or from external events. The Group maintains constructive relationships with its regulators around the world and responds appropriately to developments in relation to key regulatory changes. The Operational Risk Appetite framework enables management and the Board to assess the overall quality of the operational risk environment relative to risk appetite and, where a Business Unit (or the Group) are outside of appetite, require clear and robust plans to be put in place in order to return to appetite. As part of our continual improvements of or risk management approach to keep pace with the business, increasing regulatory expectations, and the macroeconomic and geo-political environment, we have recently implemented risk improvements. Those improvements have strengthened and enhanced our risk management capabilities throughout the organisation and enabled us to operate a stronger control environment, improve understanding and accountabilities of risks, reduce the complexity of how the business thinks about and manages risks and create greater collaboration across the first and second lines of defence to provide higher quality advice and challenge.\n\nWe have implemented measures to improve the Group's operational resilience in response to new PRA and FCA operational resilience regulations (including outsourcing and third-party risk management) which took effect on 31 March 2022. This includes a programme of resilience and crisis response testing to ensure the continued financial safety and soundness of Aviva's business and our ability to support approved operating tolerances for the most important business services that our customers rely upon. Operational resilience disciplines and assessments have been used in response to global events, including: changes to the geo-political environment; financial market instability; and the continuity of Winter power supplies.\n\nWe rely on several outsourcing providers for critical business processes, customer servicing, investment operations and IT support. To manage the risk of failure of a critical outsourcing provider, businesses are required to identify business critical outsourced functions (internal and external) and for each to have exit and termination plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place in the event of supplier failure, which are reviewed annually. We also carry out supplier financial stability reviews at least annually.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 58 - Risk management continued\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict and increasing geo-political tensions more generally have heightened the risk of cyber security attacks on the Group or its suppliers, with the potential to cause business service interruption and/or data or intellectual property theft. In response Aviva continues to actively monitor the threat environment and enhance its IT infrastructure and cyber controls to identify, detect and prevent attacks. Aviva's cyber defences are regularly tested using our own 'ethical hacking' team and we have engaged our suppliers to put in place all reasonable measures so that services to Aviva and our customers are protected.\n\nThe Group actively monitors social and other media in order to manage misinformation about our business, products, colleagues and customers should we be targeted by a hostile actor in the context of the situation in Ukraine or elsewhere, taking corrective media action if necessary.\n\nWe are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation. Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us (or any of our intermediaries) do not perform as expected (whether or not the expectations are founded) or customers' expectations of the product change.\n\nWe have designed our products and business processes so that we treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints. Failure to treat our customers fairly is counter to our purpose, values and culture and could result in regulatory action and penalties, as well as impact our brands and/or reputation. The FCA stated that by the end of October 2022, firms' boards (or equivalent management body) should agree Consumer Duty implementation plans. All implementation plans for Aviva in scope regulated entities have gone through the agreed governance process and have been signed off by the appropriate boards. Our Consumer Duty Framework, includes guidance on what represents a good customer outcome in the context of our products and services.\n\nAviva is directly exposed to the risks associated with operating an asset management business through its ownership of Aviva Investors. The underlying risk profile of our asset management risk is derived from investment performance, specialist investment professionals and leadership, product development capabilities, fund liquidity, margin, client retention, regulatory developments, fiduciary and contractual responsibilities. Funds invested in illiquid assets such as commercial property are particularly exposed to liquidity risk. The risk profile is regularly monitored.\n\nA client relationship team is in place to manage client retention risk, while all new asset management products undergo a review and approval process at each stage of the product development process, including approvals from legal, compliance and risk functions. Investment performance against client objectives relative to agreed benchmarks is monitored as part of our investment performance and risk management process, and subject to further independent oversight and challenge by a specialist risk team, reporting directly to the Aviva Investors' Chief Risk Officer.\n\n## (h) Risk and capital management\n\n## (i) Sensitivity test analysis\n\nThe Group uses a number of sensitivity tests to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently. Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on the Group's key financial performance metrics to inform the Group's decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.\n\n## (ii) Life insurance and investment contracts\n\nThe nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements. Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit. Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business. A number of the key assumptions for the Group's central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements.\n\n## (iii) General insurance and health business\n\nGeneral insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques. These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years. In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.\n\n## (iv) Sensitivity test results\n\nIllustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and noninsurance business are set out below. For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged. Each test allows for any consequential impact on the asset and liability valuations. See below for further details on the limitations of the sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity of the net IAS 19 surplus to interest rates is provided in note 50(b)(iii).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impact of the expense sensitivity on profit/loss also includes the increase in ongoing administration expenses, in addition to the increase in the claims handling expense provision.\n\n## Fund management and non-insurance business sensitivities as at 31 December 2022\n\n| 31 December 2022 Impact on profit/loss before tax \u00a3m          | Interest rates  +1%   | Interest rates  -1%   | Credit spreads  +0.5%   | Equity/ property   +10%   | Equity/ property  -10%   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Total                                                         | -                     | -                     | -                       | -                         | -                        |\n| 31 December 2022 Impact on shareholders' equity before tax \u00a3m | Interest rates  +1%   | Interest rates  -1%   | Credit spreads  +0.5%   | Equity/ property   +10%   | Equity/ property  -10%   |\n| Total                                                         | -                     | -                     | -                       | -                         | -                        |\n| Sensitivities as at 31 December 2021                          |                       |                       |                         |                           |                          |\n| 31 December 2021 Impact on profit/loss before tax \u00a3m          | Interest rates  +1%   | Interest rates  -1%   | Credit spreads  +0.5%   | Equity/ property   +10%   | Equity/ property  -10%   |\n| Total                                                         | -                     | -                     | 35                      | -                         | -                        |\n| 31 December 2021 Impact on shareholders' equity before tax \u00a3m | Interest rates  +1%   | Interest rates  -1%   | Credit spreads  +0.5%   | Equity/ property   +10%   | Equity/ property  -10%   |\n| Total                                                         | -                     | -                     | 35                      | -                         | -                        |\n\n## Limitations of sensitivity analysis\n\nThe tables above demonstrate the effect of an instantaneous change in a key assumption while other assumptions remain unchanged. In reality, changes may occur over a period of time and there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors. It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis does not take into consideration that the Group's assets and liabilities are actively managed. Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs. For example, the Group's financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.\n\nAs investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocations and taking other protective action.\n\nOther limitations in the above sensitivity analysis include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risks that only represent the Group's view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty and the assumption that all parameters move in an identical fashion. Specific examples:\n\n- a. The sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in interest rates at all terms. These results should not be used to calculate the impact of non-parallel yield movements.\n- b. The sensitivity analysis assumes equivalent assumption changes across all markets i.e. UK and non-UK yield curves move by the same amounts, equity markets across the world rise or fall identically\n\nAdditionally, the movements observed by assets held by Aviva will not be identical to market indices so caution is required when applying the sensitivities to observed index movements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 59 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThis note gives details of the various financial instruments the Group uses to mitigate risk.\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with the Group's overall risk management strategy. The objectives include managing exposure to market, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.\n\nIn the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments. The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction. The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held (or issued) by the Group.\n\nThe fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.) master agreements or their equivalent. Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure. In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties. See note 60 for further information on collateral and net credit risk of derivative instruments.\n\n## (a) Instruments designated for hedge accounting\n\nThe Group has formally assessed and documented the hedge effectiveness for financial instruments designated as hedging instruments in accordance with IAS 39.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nTo reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has designated a portion of its euro and Canadian dollar denominated debt as hedging instruments to hedge the net investment in its Irish and Canadian subsidiaries. The carrying value of the debt designated in net investment hedges at 31 December 2022 was \u00a3964 million (2021: \u00a3917 million). The fair value of the debt at that date was \u00a3891 million (2021: \u00a3984 million).\n\nForeign exchange loss of \u00a338 million (2021: gains of \u00a331 million) on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement of financial position date in respect of the effective portion have been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders' equity.\n\nHedge accounting applied to the Group's net investment in Aviva France and Aviva Italy was terminated at 31 December 2020. The amounts previously recognised in the hedging instruments reserve were recycled to the income statement on completion of the disposals during 2021 (see note 37).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group did not apply cash flow hedging during the year. In 2021, the Group terminated the cash flow hedges used for hedging the currency forward contracts on completion of the disposal of Aviva France and Aviva Poland.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The credit support agreement will normally dictate the threshold over which collateral needs to be pledged by Aviva or its counterparty.\n\nDerivative transactions requiring Aviva or its counterparty to post collateral are typically the result of over-the-counter derivative trades, comprised mostly of interest rate swaps, currency swaps and credit default swaps. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard long-term borrowing, derivative, securities lending and securities borrowing activities. The derivative assets and liabilities in the table below are made up of the contracts described in detail in note 59.\n\nAviva participates in a number of stock lending and repurchase arrangements. In some of these arrangements cash is exchanged by Aviva for securities and a related receivable is recognised within 'Loans to banks' in note 23. These arrangements are reflected in the tables below. In instances where the collateral is recognised in the statement of financial position, the obligation for its return is included within 'Payables and other financial liabilities' in note 52.\n\nIn other arrangements, securities are exchanged for other securities. The collateral received must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts. Transfer of title always occurs for the collateral received. In many instances, however, no market risk or economic benefit is exchanged and these transactions are not recognised in the statement of financial position in accordance with our accounting policies, and accordingly not included in the tables below.\n\n|                                            |                     |                     |                                                                |                             | Amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements Amounts under a master netting agreement   | Amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements Amounts under a master netting agreement   | Amounts subject to enforceable netting arrangements Amounts under a master netting agreement   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Offset under IAS 32 | Offset under IAS 32 | Offset under IAS 32                                            | but not offset under IAS 32 | but not offset under IAS 32                                                                    | but not offset under IAS 32                                                                    | but not offset under IAS 32                                                                    |\n| 2022                                       | Gross amounts \u00a3m    | Amounts offset \u00a3m   | Net amounts reported in the statement of financial position \u00a3m | Financial instruments \u00a3m    | Cash collateral \u00a3m                                                                             | Securities collateral received/ pledged \u00a3m                                                     | Net amount \u00a3m                                                                                  |\n| Financial assets                           |                     |                     |                                                                |                             |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |                                                                                                |\n| Derivative financial assets                | 3,404               | -

The actual amount of collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables above in the case of over-collateralisation.\n\nThe total amount of collateral received which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default, excluding collateral related to balances recognised within 'Loans to banks' disclosed in note 23, was \u00a34,877 million (2021: \u00a313,385 million), all of which other than \u00a3322 million (2021: \u00a31,190 million) is related to securities lending arrangements. Collateral of \u00a31,568 million (2021: \u00a31,318 million) has been received related to balances recognised within 'Loans to banks' in note 23. The value of collateral that was actually sold or repledged in the absence of default was \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\nThe level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Group's risk exposure. The fair values of collateral received approximate to their carrying amounts.\n\n## 61 - Related party transactions\n\nThis note gives details of the transactions between Group companies and related parties which comprise our joint ventures, associates and staff pension schemes.\n\nThe Group undertakes transactions with related parties in the normal course of business.

The Group has equity interests in these joint ventures, together with the provision of administration services and financial management to many of them. Our fund management companies also charge fees to these joint ventures for administration services and for arranging external finance.\n\nKey management personnel of the Company may from time to time purchase insurance, savings, asset management or annuity products marketed by group companies on equivalent terms to those available to all employees of the Group. In 2022, other transactions with key management personnel were not deemed to be significant either by size or in the context of their individual financial positions.\n\nOur UK fund management companies manage most of the assets held by the Group's main UK staff pension scheme, for which they charge fees based on the level of funds under management. The main UK scheme holds investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies with other group companies, as explained in note 50(b)(ii). As at 31 December 2022, the Friends Provident Pension Scheme ('FPPS'), acquired in 2015 as part of the acquisition of the Friends Life business, held an insurance policy of \u00a3432 million (2021: \u00a3625 million) issued by a group company, which eliminates on consolidation. During the year, Aviva Group Holdings Limited provided a short term loan of \u00a388 million to FPPS. As at 31 December 2022 \u00a326 million remained outstanding, which is included within the Group's loan assets and as a deduction from FPPS plan assets, and does not eliminate on consolidation.\n\nThe related parties' receivables are not secured and no guarantees were received in respect thereof. The receivables will be settled in accordance with normal credit terms.\n\n.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total premiums of \u00a31,324 million (2021: \u00a32,456 million) were paid by the scheme to AVLAP, with AVLAP recognising total gross liabilities of \u00a31,001 million (2021: \u00a32,184 million). The difference between the premiums and the gross liabilities implies profit 2 of \u00a3323 million (2021: \u00a3272 million), which does not include costs incurred by the Group associated with the transactions, and is driven primarily by differences between the measurement bases used to calculate the premium and the accounting value of the associated gross liabilities. The ASPS recognised the total plan assets of \u00a3891 million (2021: \u00a31,760 million), with the difference between the plan assets recognised and the premiums paid being recognised as an actuarial loss through Other Comprehensive Income. As at 31 December 2022, AVLAP recognised cumulative technical provisions of \u00a33,342 million (2021: \u00a34,264 million) in relation to buy-in transactions with the ASPS which have been included within the Group's gross liabilities, and the ASPS held a transferable plan asset of \u00a32,875 million (2021: \u00a33,543 million) which does not eliminate on consolidation.\n\n## Key management compensation\n\nThe total compensation to those employees classified as key management, being those having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, including the executive and non-executive directors is as follows:\n\n|                                      | 2022 \u00a3m   |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Salary and other short-term benefits | 8.3       |       9   |\n| Post-employment benefits             | 0.9       |       1.1 |\n| Equity compensation plans            | 18.9      |      14.9 |\n| Termination benefits                 | -         |       1.5 |\n| Total                                | 28.1      |      26.5 |\n\nIn 2022, roles within the management structure were reviewed and certain positions were determined to no longer be persons with decision making responsibility. As a result, the number of individuals classified as key management personnel has reduced as at 31 December 2022. Information concerning individual directors' emoluments, interests and transactions is given in the Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n## 62 - IFRS 17 Transition\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, is a new accounting standard that provides a comprehensive and consistent approach to accounting for insurance contracts. IFRS 17 is effective for the Group for the annual reporting period beginning 1 January 2023 and replaces IFRS 4, which was issued in 2005 and was largely based on grandfathering of previous local accounting policies. The Group is implementing IFRS 17 retrospectively as of 1 January 2023. The opening balance sheet date for comparative information is 1 January 2022, which is also known as the transition date.\n\nIFRS 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participation features (participating investment contracts). It introduces a model that measures groups of contracts based on the present value of future cash flows with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk (the fulfilment cash flows); and a contractual service margin (CSM), representing the unearned profit to be recognised in profit or loss over the service period (coverage period). Losses on contracts that are onerous at inception are recognised immediately. The core of IFRS 17 is the general measurement model (GMM), supplemented by a specific adaptation for contracts with direct participation features (the variable fee approach (VFA)), and a simplified approach (the premium allocation approach (PAA)) for short-duration contracts.\n\nThe application of IFRS 17 significantly impacts the measurement and presentation of insurance contracts, reinsurance contracts and participating investment contracts. The financial impact of measurement changes will be more significant for life insurance than non-life insurance contracts, however there will be significant changes to presentation and disclosures for all insurance contracts. Investment contracts with no significant insurance risk or discretionary participating features, equity release mortgage loans, and investment management business are out of scope and therefore not impacted by the new standard.\n\nUnder IFRS 17 the presentation of insurance revenue and insurance service expenses in the statement of comprehensive income is based on the concept of insurance services provided during the period; and extensive disclosures provide information on the recognised amounts from insurance contracts and the nature and extent of risks arising from these contracts. We expect to align disclosure to three major groupings: Life Risk, Life Participating and Non-life (general insurance and health) which broadly align with the IFRS 17 measurement models GMM, VFA and PAA respectively.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The LRC represents the obligation under the insurance contract for insured events that have not yet occurred i.e., the obligation that relates to the unexpired portion of the coverage period, including the CSM. The LIC reflects the obligation to investigate and pay valid claims for insured events that have already occurred, including events that have already occurred but for which claims have not been reported. The key features of each measurement model are set out below. As the LIC is most relevant for non-life insurance contracts, the descriptions of the GMM and VFA measurement models focus on the LRC.\n\n## i. GMM\n\nThe GMM is the default IFRS 17 measurement model. The fulfilment cash flows comprise the present value of future cash flows within the boundary of the contract, discounted at current rates, and an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk.\n\nAt inception, a CSM is recognised for each new group of contracts which represents the unearned profit to be recognised over the coverage period of the contract. Except for reinsurance contracts held, losses on groups of contracts that are onerous at inception are recognised immediately.\n\nThe CSM is subsequently remeasured for changes in the fulfilment cash flows relating to non-financial risk, applying locked in financial assumptions. Interest is accreted on the CSM using the locked-in discount rate and the CSM is amortised over the coverage period of the contract. The coverage period is determined based on the service provided to customers including both insurance and investment services. Losses on groups of contracts that are profitable at inception but subsequently become onerous, are recognised immediately.\n\nIn contrast to insurance contracts, the CSM for groups of reinsurance contracts held can be an asset or liability. If reinsurance is in place when underlying groups of insurance contracts become onerous the reinsurance CSM recognised is adjusted to offset the gross losses arising. Where the net cost of purchasing reinsurance contracts held relates to events that occurred prior to purchase (for example adverse development cover) no CSM is recognised, and the net cost is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## ii. VFA\n\nThe VFA is a modified approach to the GMM that is applied to groups of insurance and investment contracts with direct participating features which meet eligibility requirements that demonstrate they provide substantial investment related services to policyholders.\n\nFulfilment cash flows for VFA contracts comprise the obligation to pay policyholders an amount equal to the fair value of underlying items, less the variable fee for future service. The variable fee includes the present value of the shareholders' share of the fair value of underlying items adjusted for cash flows that do not vary with those underlying items. The risk adjustment reflects the compensation for non-financial risk in relation to the variable fee only.\n\nThe CSM is subsequently remeasured for changes in the variable fee due to both financial and non-financial risks using current market discount rates. Consistent with the GMM, the CSM is recognised in profit or loss over the coverage period in line with the insurance and investment services provided to customers.\n\n## iii. PAA\n\nThe PAA is a simplified measurement model which can be applied to all short duration contracts and to longer duration contracts that meet PAA eligibility criteria. It is applied to all of the Group's non-life insurance and reinsurance contracts except for contracts that reinsure adverse development of incurred claims.\n\nThe LRC is measured as the amount of premium received net of acquisition cash flows, less the amount of premiums and acquisition cash flows that have been recognised in profit or loss over the expired portion of the coverage period. Premium receipts and acquisition cashflows are recognised in profit or loss over the life of the contract, based on the expected timing of incurred claims. This approach is similar to the Group's previous approach for measuring non-life insurance contracts under IFRS 4.\n\nIf facts and circumstances indicate that a group of contracts may be onerous, the LRC is measured using GMM principles and losses for onerous contracts are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor most contracts applying PAA, the measurement of the LIC aligns to the GMM, with an explicit risk adjustment for non-financial risk, and discounting applied to expected cash-flows. For Health contracts a PAA exemption is applied to measure the LIC on an undiscounted basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 62 - IFRS 17 Transition continued\n\n## (b) Significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates\n\nThe implementation of IFRS 17 will require the Group to apply new accounting policies, replacing those previously applied under IFRS 4, and make estimates and assumptions that will affect items reported in the consolidated income statement and statement of financial position. The significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates that will be applied by the Group on transition to IFRS 17 are summarised below.\n\n## i. Choice of measurement model\n\n## VFA eligibility\n\nLife business is considered eligible for the VFA measurement model where:\n\n- \u00b7 Contractual terms evidence that policyholders participate in a pool of clearly identified underlying items, for example unit-linked or withprofits funds;\n- \u00b7 The policyholders expect to receive a substantial share of the returns on underlying items (defined by the Group as greater than 50%); and\n- \u00b7 A substantial proportion of changes in amounts payable to policyholders varies with returns on the underlying items (defined by the Group as a correlation coefficient of greater than 50%).\n\nReinsurance contracts held are not eligible to apply the VFA.\n\n## PAA eligibility\n\nThe vast majority of the Group's direct non-life business has a duration of one year or less and is automatically eligible for the PAA model. For the remainder, financial modelling is performed to compare the value of the LRC measured under GMM and PAA. Where the LRC does not materially differ between the two measurement models (over the duration of the contract and in a range of reasonably foreseeable scenarios) the contract group is PAA eligible.\n\nThe Group has multiple non-life reinsurance contracts which are greater than one year in duration. These are assessed for PAA eligibility by applying the same financial modelling approach and are all PAA eligible except for treaties reinsuring the adverse development of incurred claims.\n\n## ii. Level of aggregation\n\nIFRS 17 specifies the unit of account is a group of contracts and provides guidance on the level at which insurance contracts can be aggregated into groups for measurement purposes. Discrete CSM's are determined for each group of insurance contracts applying GMM or VFA. Groups of insurance contracts have been determined by identifying portfolios of insurance contracts, comprising contracts subject to similar risks that are managed together, and dividing each portfolio into annual cohorts by year of issue. Each annual cohort is then further subdivided into three groups based on the profitability of contracts determined at initial recognition and comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 contracts that are onerous;\n- \u00b7 contracts that have no significant possibility of becoming onerous; (based on the probability that changes in assumptions would result in contracts becoming onerous); and\n- \u00b7 all remaining contracts.\n\nReinsurance contracts held are also subdivided into three profitability groups, determined by reference to net gains/losses on initial recognition, and comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 contracts that have a net gain at initial recognition;\n- \u00b7 contracts that have no significant possibility of a net gain arising subsequently; and\n- \u00b7 all remaining contracts.\n\nThe approach to profitability grouping makes use of sets. Where it can be demonstrated that all contracts within a set are sufficiently homogeneous, they are allocated to the same profitability group without performing an individual contract assessment. For Life product lines, sets of contracts usually correspond to policyholder pricing groups. The likelihood of changes in insurance, financial and other exposures resulting in contracts becoming onerous is monitored at the level of these pricing groups.\n\nFor contracts measured under the PAA, IFRS 17 permits a simplification whereby contract groups are assumed not to be onerous unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. The Group has used internal management information to identify facts and circumstances that may indicate that a group is onerous.\n\n## iii. Estimate of future cash flows\n\nThe estimate of future cash flows is assessed at the level of profitability groups and represents the best estimate of the Group's cost to fulfil a contract incorporating current estimates of non-financial assumptions. The estimate allows for all the cash inflows and outflows expected to occur within the contract boundary. Cash flows are modelled separately for gross and reinsurance contracts.\n\n## Principal non-financial assumptions\n\nPrincipal non-financial assumptions used in the calculation of life insurance and participating investment contract fulfilment cash flows include those in respect of annuitant and assurance mortality and future expenses. Expenses must be directly attributable to fulfilling insurance contracts, including an allocation of overheads to the extent that they can be allocated to groups of contracts in a systematic and rational way.\n\nPrincipal non-financial assumptions used in the calculation of the non-life LIC use past claims experience to project future claims (estimated using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 62 - IFRS 17 Transition continued\n\n## iv. Financial assumptions\n\n## Discount rates\n\nDiscounting is applied to the estimate of future cash flows. The Group uses a bottom-up discount rate for all life and non-life insurance contracts except for annuities. A top-down discount rate is applied to annuities to reflect more appropriately the characteristics of the annuity liabilities. For other contracts where liabilities are subject to lapse risk or where cashflows depend on underlying asset performance (such as unit-linked and with-profits), the characteristics of the liability can be reflected using the bottom-up method which requires the application of less judgement.\n\n## Top-down Discount rates\n\nThe discount rate is determined from the yield implicit in the fair value of an appropriate reference portfolio of assets that reflects the characteristics of the liability. Adjustments are made for differences between the reference portfolio and liability cash flows, including an allowance for defaults which reflects the compensation a market participant would require for credit risk.\n\nThe CSM for annuity contracts is measured using a locked-in discount rate based on assets expected to be originated for new business at initial recognition of the contracts. On subsequent measurement of the fulfilment cash flows the reference portfolio is based on the assets held to match the portfolio of liabilities. For recently written contracts, an adjustment is made to liabilities where appropriate assets are yet to be sourced.\n\n## Bottom-up Discount rates\n\nThe discount rate is determined as the risk-free yield, adjusted for differences in liquidity characteristics between the financial assets used to derive the risk-free yield and the relevant liability cash flows (known as an 'illiquidity premium').\n\nThe illiquidity premium is determined as a percentage of the current spread over the risk-free yield on an index of covered bonds. The percentage applied reflects the liquidity characteristics of the liabilities including the propensity and ability of policyholders to lapse or surrender their contracts; for example, 100% for structured settlements where surrenders are not possible, and 0% for unit-linked contracts where policyholders can normally immediately surrender their contract for the unit value. An intermediate percentage is applied for other types of business.\n\n## Inflation assumptions\n\nFuture inflation assumptions are treated as a financial assumption when applied to policyholder benefits or outsourced maintenance expenses that are contractually linked to an inflation index.\n\n## Presentation of financial assumption changes\n\nThe impact of changes in financial assumptions can be presented in the income statement or in the statement of comprehensive income as a matter of accounting policy choice. The Group has elected to recognise these impacts in the income statement, consistent with the approach to the presentation of fair value movements on assets in accordance with IFRS 9, thus eliminating accounting mismatches.\n\n## v. Risk Adjustment\n\nThe risk adjustment reflects the compensation required by the Group to accept the uncertainty about the amount and timing of future cash flows that arises from non-financial risk. The calculation of the risk adjustment is calibrated to the Group's pricing and capital allocation framework, leveraging the Solvency II view of non-financial risk, considering a lifetime view, and including diversification between risks.\n\n## vi. CSM\n\nThe CSM represents a liability for unearned profit measured at inception and recognised in the income statement over the life of the contract as insurance and investment related services are provided to the customer. The amount of CSM amortisation recognised in profit or loss each year is determined by considering, for each group of contracts, coverage units that reflect the quantity of the benefits provided in each period and the expected coverage period.\n\nThe coverage units used by major product lines are:\n\n| Product line                           | Coverage units                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Immediate annuities                    | Annuity outgo                                                                                                                                               |\n| Deferred annuities                     | Annuity outgo for insurance service post retirement and weighted expected investment return for the  investment return service provided prior to retirement |\n| Individual and Group Protection        | Sum assured                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Individual and Group Income Protection | Benefit amount payable                                                                                                                                      |\n| Unit linked insurance                  | Sum assured including unit value                                                                                                                            |\n| With-profits                           | Cost of guarantees plus asset share                                                                                                                         |\n\nFor deferred annuities the weighting between insurance and investment return services targets equivalence at retirement with the CSM for an immediate annuity that only provides post-retirement insurance services, after allowing for expected retirement date, transfers and commutations.\n\nCoverage units for reinsurance contracts held are typically consistent with the underlying gross contracts, adjusted for differences in the services provided.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insurance acquisition cashflows\n\nInsurance acquisition cashflows are initially deferred on the balance sheet as an insurance acquisition cashflow asset and then allocated against groups of insurance contracts to which they are directly attributable. This includes instances where insurance acquisition cashflows are directly attributable to the future renewal of existing contract groups for some products in the Group's non-life business. For contract groups applying PAA, the Group has chosen not to apply an exemption to recognise insurance acquisition cashflows as an expense at the point they are incurred.\n\nWhere insurance acquisition cashflows are allocated to contract groups applying GMM or VFA, they are included within the measurement of the CSM and recognised in the income statement over the period which services are provided to the customer. Insurance acquisition cashflows allocated to contract groups applying PAA are recognised in the income statement over the life of the contract based on the expected timing of incurred claims.\n\nInsurance acquisition cashflow assets are assessed for impairment where facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. The Group uses data on customer retention rates and the profitability of products to identify such facts and circumstances.\n\n## (c) IFRS 17 transition approach\n\nChanges in accounting policies resulting from the implementation of IFRS 17 must be applied using the Fully Retrospective Approach (FRA) where practicable, calculating the CSM at the date of transition as if the standard had always applied. Where FRA is not practicable for a particular group of insurance contracts there is a choice to apply the Modified Retrospective Approach (MRA) to the extent that reasonable and supportable information exists, or the Fair Value Approach (FVA). The choice between MRA and FVA can have a significant impact on the valuation of the CSM on transition and has been made separately for each group of insurance contracts for which it is impracticable to apply FRA.\n\nFor non-life business in scope of the PAA the FRA has been used.\n\nFor Life business and non-life adverse development reinsurance, the Group has applied judgement when determining whether the FRA is practicable and whether reasonable and supportable information exists to apply the MRA. For this business the following approaches have been applied on transition to IFRS 17:\n\n- \u00b7 The FRA has been used for the majority of business written or acquired since 2016, as prior to this date the risk adjustment is considered indeterminable without the benefit of hindsight due to the multiple views of risk that were reported at that time;\n- \u00b7 The MRA has been used for certain portfolios of UK individual protection business written in the period 2012-2015 and for certain portfolios of acquired UK VFA business; and\n- \u00b7 The FVA has been used for all other business written prior to 2016, including annuities.\n\nOn transition, approximately 35% of the CSM is calculated under the FRA, 10% under the MRA and 55% under the FVA.\n\n## Application of the MRA\n\nWhere information is not available to undertake the FRA the MRA allows certain modifications to be applied provided reasonable and supportable information is available to apply the modification. The aim is to achieve the closest possible outcome to the FRA.\n\nFor contracts transitioned under the FRA or MRA, the opening CSM balance at 1 January 2022 includes the effect of amortisation of the CSM for the period of retrospective restatement.\n\n## Application of the FVA\n\nUnder the FVA the CSM recognised at the transition date is determined as the fair value of the portfolio of contracts at the transition date less the fulfilment cash flows at the transition date. Unlike the FRA and MRA no pre-transition information is required to calculate the FVA CSM.\n\nWhere FVA has been applied, the fair value has been derived in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and represents the price a market participant would require to assume the liabilities in an orderly transaction. As quoted market prices are not available for portfolios of insurance contracts, valuation models have been used to calculate the fair value of each portfolio. The choice of model and inputs to the model involves judgement and this gives rise to a range of plausible fair values.\n\nValuation inputs reference market information where available with unobservable inputs otherwise used. Inputs have been calibrated to those Aviva would expect market participants would use when pricing the liabilities. The most significant judgements for each portfolio are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Identification of the principal market\n- \u00b7 The return on assets backing the portfolio\n- \u00b7 The level of regulatory capital required to support the portfolio\n- \u00b7 The required rate of return on capital deployed\n\nFor business transitioning under the FVA, the Group has taken advantage of the simplification permitting contracts in different annual cohorts to be placed into a single group of contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The transition CSM includes profits that were previously reported in accordance with  IFRS 4 and subject to tax.The reduction in net assets on adoption of IFRS 17, including the CSM recognition,  gives rise to a deferred tax asset as tax on profits is only paid once. The deferred tax asset will reverse as the  CSM unwinds and profits are recognised in future. |\n\nThe impact on transition to IFRS 17 is most significant for the Group's annuity and protection business where the deferral of profit in the CSM is the most material. A significant proportion of the CSM on transition arises from the Group's existing immediate annuity portfolio, the unwind of which will become a material driver of the contribution to future profits by the UK & Ireland Life operating segment. Offsetting this, the majority of profits on new annuity and protection business will now be deferred. In addition, under IFRS 17, the impact of changes in non-financial assumptions on future cashflows will be adjusted through the CSM and spread forward rather than being recognised immediately in profit as under IFRS 4.\n\nThere are more limited impacts from the Group's other lines of insurance business with no impact for business out of scope of IFRS 17 including Investment contracts with no significant insurance risk or discretionary participating features, equity release mortgage loans, and investment management business.\n\nAt this stage the impacts of IFRS 17 on the Group's consolidated income statement and statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 cannot be reliably estimated pending full implementation and testing of systems, including the operational effectiveness of internal control processes. The Group's IFRS 17 transition programme will conclude in the first half of 2023.\n\nIFRS 17 will have no impact on our Solvency II performance measures or the Group financial targets. Furthermore, we do not expect IFRS 17 to impact on dividend policy and dividend guidance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the year ended 31 December 2022, \u00a3337 million of shares were purchased and shares with a nominal value of \u00a319 million have been cancelled as part of the share buyback programme\n- 2. On 2 March 2022, Aviva announced a proposed return of capital, via a \u00a33,750 million B Share Scheme for the holders of ordinary shares. 3,687,322,000 B shares were issued for nil consideration with a nominal value of 101.69 pence per share on 16 May 2022, resulting in a total of \u00a33,750 million being credited to the B share capital account. At the same time, the merger reserve was reduced by \u00a33,750 million. On 17 May 2022, the B shares were redeemed at 101.69 pence per share, which resulted in a \u00a33,750 million reduction in the B share capital account and a corresponding increase in the capital redemption reserve. Retained earnings reduced by \u00a33,750 million on payment of the return of capital to ordinary shareholders.\n- 3. On 15 June 2022, the Group issued \u00a3500 million of 6.875% fixed rate reset perpetual Restricted Tier 1 contingent convertible notes (the RT1 notes). These RT1 notes are treated as equity and any coupon payments are recognised directly in equity as they arise (see note 35).\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021\n\n|                                               | Note Ordinary  share  capital \u00a3m   | Preference  capital   | share  \u00a3m   | Share  premium \u00a3m   | Capital  redemption  reserve \u00a3m   | Merger  reserve \u00a3m   | Equity  compensation  reserve \u00a3m   | Retained  earnings \u00a3m   | Tier 1 notes \u00a3m   | Total  equity \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                          |                                    | 982                   | 200         | 1,242               | 44                                | 6,438                | 106                                | 3,235                   |                   | -    12,247        |\n| Profit for the year                           |                                    | -                     | -           | -                   | -                                 | -                    | -                                  | 7,140                   | -                 | 7,140              |\n| Other comprehensive expense                   |                                    | -                     | -           | -                   | -                                 | -                    | -                                  | 3                       | -                 | 3                  |\n| Total comprehensive expense for the year      |                                    | -                     | -           | -                   | -                                 | -                    | -                                  | 7,143                   | -                 | 7,143              |\n| Dividends and appropriations                  | 14                                 | -                     | -           | -                   | -                                 | -                    |                                    | -    (1,127)            |                   | -    (1,127)       |\n| Reserves credit for equity compensation plans | 32                                 | -                     | -           | -                   | -                                 | -                    | 24                                 | -                       | -                 | 24                 |\n| Shares issued under equity compensation plans | 32                                 | 1                     | -           | 6                   | -                                 | -                    | (29)                               | 3                       | -                 | (19)               |\n| Shares purchased in buyback                   | 31                                 | (42)                  | -           | -                   | 42                                | -                    | -                                  | (663)                   | -                 | (663)              |\n| Balance at 31 December                        |                                    | 941                   | 200         | 1,248               | 86                                | 6,438                | 101                                | 8,591                   |                   | -    17,605        |\n\nWhere applicable, the accounting policies of the Company are the same as those of the Group.

During the year coupon payments of \u00a317 million were made (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\n## M - Contingent liabilities\n\nDetails of the Company's contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 54.\n\n## N - Risk and capital management\n\nRisk and capital management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, notes 56 and 58.\n\nThe business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiaries and joint venture operations. Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves, and full details of the major risks and the Group's approach to managing these are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 58. Such investments are held by the Company at cost in accordance with accounting policy D.\n\nFinancial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries. As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired. The credit quality of receivables and other financial assets is monitored by the Company and provisions are made for expected credit losses. There are no material expected credit losses over the lifetime of the financial assets.\n\nFinancial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings (details of which are provided in note J and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 51) and loans owed to subsidiaries. Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nLoans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates. The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments (which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations) held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each company's net exposure.\n\nAll of the Company's long-term external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates. However, for short-term commercial paper, the Company is affected by changes in these rates to the extent the redemption of these borrowings is funded by the issuance of new commercial paper or other borrowings. Further details of the Company's borrowings are provided in note J and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 51.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the company financial statements continued\n\n## N - Risk and capital management continued\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe effect of a 100 basis point increase/decrease in interest rates on floating rate loans due to and from subsidiaries and on refinancing short-term commercial paper as it matures would be a decrease/increase in profit before tax of \u00a392 million (2021: decrease/increase of \u00a322 million). We manage and hedge our interest rate exposure through setting risk tolerance levels on a Solvency II cover ratio basis. Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Company's direct subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world. The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 58(c)(v).\n\nThe Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in Euros and Canadian dollars.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form. The Company's main sources of liquidity are liquid assets held within the Company and its subsidiary Aviva Group Holdings Limited, and dividends received from the Group's insurance and asset management businesses. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long-term instruments including commercial papers and medium and long-term debt. In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Company maintains significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.\n\nMaturity analysis of external borrowings and amounts due to and by subsidiaries are provided in notes J and F respectively.\n\n## Intra-group capital arrangement\n\nConsistent with our capital management framework, the Group has in place intra-group arrangements to provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries. In the normal course of business, the Group will provide additional capital support to its regulated subsidiaries in certain circumstances. While the Group considers it unlikely that such support will be required, the arrangements are intended to provide additional comfort to its regulated subsidiaries and its policyholders. See note 56b for more detail on Risks and Capital Management Objectives.\n\n## O - Related party transactions\n\nThe Company had the following related party transactions.\n\nLoans to and from subsidiaries are made on normal arm's-length commercial terms. The maturity analysis of the related party loans is as follows:\n\n## (i) Loans owed by subsidiaries\n\n| Maturity analysis   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within 1 year       | 546       | -         |\n| 1 - 5 years         | 1,624     | 3,992     |\n| Over 5 years        | 494       | 469       |\n| Total               | 2,664     | 4,461     |\n\nThe interest received on these loans is \u00a367 million (2021: \u00a366 million). See note A.\n\nOn 1 January 2013, Aviva International Holdings Limited, an indirect subsidiary, transferred an unsecured loan with the Company of \u20ac250 million to Aviva Group Holdings Limited, its direct subsidiary. The loan, originally entered into on 7 May 2003, accrues interest at a fixed rate of 5.5% with settlement to be paid at maturity in May 2033.

APMs are non-GAAP measures which are used to supplement the disclosures prepared in accordance with other regulations, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Solvency II. We believe these measures provide useful information to enhance the understanding of our financial performance. However, APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the amounts determined according to other regulations.\n\nThe APMs utilised by Aviva may not be the same as those used by other insurers and may change over time. The calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods unless otherwise stated.\n\nFurther details on APMs derived from IFRS measures and APMs derived from Solvency II measures are provided in the following sections. A further section describes Other APMs.\n\n## APMs derived from IFRS measures\n\nA number of APMs relating to IFRS are utilised to measure and monitor the Group's performance\n\n- \u00b7 Group adjusted operating profit\n- \u00b7 Combined operating ratio\n- \u00b7 Claims, commission, and expense ratios\n- \u00b7 Operating earnings per share\n- \u00b7 Controllable costs\n- \u00b7 IFRS return on equity\n- \u00b7 IFRS net asset value per share\n- \u00b7 Assets Under Management and Assets Under Administration\n- \u00b7 Net flows\n- \u00b7 Aviva Investors revenue\n- \u00b7 Cost income ratio\n\nDefinitions and additional information, including reconciliation to the relevant amounts in the IFRS Financial Statements and, where appropriate, commentary on the material reconciling items are included within this section.\n\n## Group adjusted operating profit\n\nGroup operating profit is an APM that supports decision making and internal performance management of the Group's operating segments, that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting the life and non-life insurance businesses. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items. The various items excluded from Group adjusted operating profit, but included in IFRS profit before tax, are:\n\n## Investment variances, economic assumption changes and short-term fluctuation in return on investments\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for the life insurance business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities. The expected rate of return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification.\n\nFor fixed interest securities classified as fair value through profit or loss, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risk. Where such securities are classified as available for sale the expected return comprises interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase. The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the opening 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit includes the effect of variances in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions. Changes due to economic items, such as market value movement and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nGroup adjusted operating profit for the non-life insurance business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder funds over the period. Expected investment returns are calculated for equities and properties by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the long-term rate of return. This rate of return is the same as that applied for the long-term business expected returns. The long-term return for other investments (including debt securities) is the actual income receivable for the period. Actual income and long-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts/premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.\n\nChanges due to market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, are disclosed separately outside Group adjusted operating profit. The impact of changes in the discount rate applied to claims provisions is also disclosed outside Group adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe exclusion of short-term investment variances from this APM reflects the long-term nature of much of our business. The Group adjusted operating profit, which is used in managing the performance of our operating segments, excludes the impact of economic variances, to provide a comparable measure year-on-year.",

These items principally relate to merger and acquisition activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from the Group adjusted operating profit APM as this is principally used to manage the performance of our operating segments when reporting to the Group chief operating decision maker.\n\n## Other items\n\nThese items are, in the directors' view, required to be separately disclosed by virtue of their nature or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group's financial performance. Other items at 2022 comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 The following items which are disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as they relate to acquisition and disposal activity that we consider to be strategic in nature:\n- - A gain of \u00a377 million relating to negative goodwill on the acquisition of Aviva India, which is excluded from Group adjusted operating profit for consistency with the treatment of impairment of goodwill;\n- - A charge of \u00a315 million arising from third party reinsurance, accepted by Aviva from the former Aviva France general insurance entity, which was terminated on 31 December 2021;\n- - A net release of provisions relating to acquisition and disposal activity of \u00a31 million;\n- - A charge of \u00a37 million relating to costs directly associated with the acquisition of Succession Wealth;\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a310 million relating to fees and charges associated with the share buyback and return of capital to ordinary shareholders; and\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a35 million relating to the cost of the employee free share award, which recognises the contribution our employees have made to the return of capital to ordinary shareholders.\n\n## Other items at 2021 comprised:\n\n- \u00b7 The following items which were disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as they relate to acquisition and disposal activity that we consider to be strategic in nature:\n- - A charge of \u00a376 million arising from third party reinsurance, accepted by Aviva from the former Aviva France general insurance entity, which was terminated on 31 December 2021;\n- - A charge of \u00a345 million relating to costs associated with the disposals of France, Italy, Aviva Vita, Poland, Singapore, Turkey and Vietnam, comprising IT contracts that have become onerous, severance costs associated with senior management and relocation costs;\n- - Net charges of \u00a322 million relating to provisions for indemnities entered into through acquisition and disposal activity.\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a351 million relating to the redemption payment in excess of the market value of debt repaid as part of the Group's deleveraging strategy. This is disclosed outside of Group adjusted operating profit as the costs arise from a strategic decision relating to the financing of the Group as a whole and not to the operating performance of the Group or its operating segments;\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a37 million relating to the cost of voluntary amendments to a small proportion of ground rent leases held by the Aviva Investors REaLM Ground Rent Fund; and\n- \u00b7 A charge of \u00a33 million relating to stamp duty costs on share buybacks\n\nThe Group adjusted operating profit APM should be viewed as complementary to IFRS measures. It is important to consider Group adjusted operating profit and profit for the year together to understand the performance of the business in the period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ratios are meaningful to stakeholders because they enhance understanding of the profitability of the business sold.\n\n## Operating earnings per share (Operating EPS)\n\nOperating EPS is calculated based on the Group adjusted operating profit attributable to ordinary shareholders net of tax, deducting non-controlling interests, preference dividends and direct capital instrument coupons divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares  in  issue,  after  deducting  treasury  shares.  Operating  EPS  is  considered  meaningful  to  stakeholders  because  it  enhances  the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by adjusting for the effects of non-operating items. A reconciliation between operating EPS and basic EPS can be found in note 13.\n\n## Controllable costs\n\nControllable costs is a useful measure of the controllable operational overheads associated with maintaining our businesses. These predominantly consist of staff costs, central costs, property and IT related costs and other expenses. Controllable costs also include indirect acquisition costs, such as underwriting overheads, and claims handling costs. These are considered to be controllable by the operating segments.\n\n## Controllable costs excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment of goodwill, associates and joint ventures; amortisation and impairment of other intangible assets acquired in business combinations; and amortisation and impairment of acquired value of in-force business. These items relate to merger, acquisition and disposal activity which we view as strategic in nature, hence they are excluded from controllable costs which is principally used to manage the performance of our operating segments.\n- \u00b7 Costs in relation to product governance and mis-selling. These costs represent compensation and redress payments made to policyholders and are excluded from controllable costs because they have characteristics of claims payments.\n- \u00b7 Premium based taxes, fees and levies that vary directly with premiums. These costs are by their nature a direct cost incurred as a result of generating premium income, and therefore not a controllable operational overhead.\n- \u00b7 Other amounts that, in management's view, are not representative of underlying day-to-day expenses involved in running the business, and that would distort the year-on-year controllable costs trend such as GI instalment income and charges reported as 'Other' outside of Group adjusted operating profit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

UK Platform relates to the assets under management in the UK Wealth business, including Succession Wealth\n\n## Net flows\n\nNet flows is used by management as a key measure of growth in AUM, from which income is generated through asset management charges (AMCs). This measure is predominantly used in Aviva Investors and the Wealth business within UK & Ireland Life.\n\nIt is the net position of inflows and outflows. Inflows include IFRS net written premiums, deposits made under investment contracts, and other funds received from customers into AUM which are not included in the Group's statement of financial position. Outflows include IFRS net claims paid, redemptions and surrenders under investment contracts, and other funds withdrawn by customers from AUM which are not included in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nAviva Investors net flows includes flows on internal assets which are managed on behalf of Group companies, and external flows on assets belonging to clients outside the Group which are not included in the Group's statement of financial position.\n\nNet flows excludes market and other movements. Net flows when positive in the period can be referred to as net inflows and when negative as net outflows.\n\n## Aviva Investors revenue\n\nAviva Investors revenue includes AMCs received, plus transaction fees and other related income, and is stated net of fees and commissions paid. It is a useful measure of revenue earned from fund management activities. Aviva Investors recognises fee income in the segmental income statement within both fee and commission income and inter-segment revenue. Fees and commissions paid are classified in fee and commission expense.\n\n## Cost income ratio (CIR)\n\nCost income ratio is used to monitor profitable growth in Aviva Investors and is useful as it gives a simple view of how efficiently the business is being run, allowing management to clearly see how costs are moving in relation to income.\n\nCost income ratio is calculated as Aviva Investors' baseline controllable costs divided by Aviva Investors revenue.\n\n|                             | Aviva Investors   | Aviva Investors   |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                             | 2022 \u00a3m           | 2021 \u00a3m           |\n| Aviva Investors revenue     | 379               | 403               |\n| Baseline controllable costs | 331               | 345               |\n| Cost income ratio           | 87%               | 86%               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Own funds are available capital resources determined under Solvency II. This includes the excess of assets over liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet, calculated on best estimate, market consistent assumptions and includes transitional measures on technical provisions (TMTP), subordinated liabilities that qualify as capital under Solvency II, and off-balance sheet own funds.\n\nThe SCR is calculated at Group level using a risk-based capital model which is calibrated to reflect the cost of mitigating the risk of insolvency to a 99.5% confidence level over a one-year time horizon - equivalent to a 1 in 200 year event - against financial and nonfinancial shocks. As a number of subsidiaries utilise the standard formula rather than a risk-based capital model to assess capital requirements, the overall Group SCR is calculated using a partial internal model, and it is shown after the impact of diversification benefit.\n\nThe 'shareholder view' of Solvency II is considered by management to be more representative of the shareholders' risk-exposure and the Group's ability to cover the SCR with eligible own funds and aligns with management's approach to dynamically manage its capital position. In arriving at the shareholder view, the following adjustments are typically made to the regulatory Solvency II position:\n\n- \u00b7 The contribution to the Group's SCR and own funds of the most material fully ring-fenced with-profits funds and staff pension schemes in surplus are excluded. These exclusions have no impact on Solvency II surplus as these funds are self-supporting on a Solvency II capital basis with any surplus capital above SCR not recognised;\n- \u00b7 A notional reset of the TMTP, calculated using the same method as used for formal TMTP resets. This presentation avoids step changes to the Solvency II position that arise only when the formal TMTP reset points are triggered. The 31 December 2022 Solvency II position includes a notional reset (an application for a formal reset has been submitted to the regulator and will be reflected in our regulatory position once approved) while the 31 December 2021 position included a formal, rather than notional, reset of the TMTP in line with the regulatory requirement to reset the TMTP at least every two years and hence no adjustment was required. In addition, due to yield rises over the period, a formal reset of TMTP as at 30 June 2022 was approved and is included in the estimated 31 December 2022 regulatory Solvency II position;\n- \u00b7 Adjustments are made if the Solvency II shareholder cover ratio does not fully reflect the effect of future regulatory changes that are known as at each reporting date. These adjustments are made in order to show a more representative view of the Group's solvency position. No adjustments for future regulatory changes were made at 31 December 2022 or 31 December 2021.\n\nThe reconciliation presented below shows the key differences between Group equity on an IFRS basis and Solvency II own funds on a shareholder view. Additional items bridging from Solvency II shareholder own funds to Solvency II regulatory own funds are presented subsequently.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For contracts that are repriced more frequently, weekly or monthly economic assumptions have been used. The economic assumptions follow Solvency II rules for risk-free rates, volatility adjustment and matching adjustment.\n\nThe operating assumptions are consistent with the Solvency II balance sheet. When these assumptions are updated, the year-to-date VNB will capture the impact of the assumption change on all business sold that year.\n\n## Matching Adjustment (MA)\n\nThe MA is an addition to the rate used to discount Solvency II best-estimate liabilities, to reflect the return on the matching assets used. An MA is applied to certain obligations based on the allocation of assets backing new business at each year-end date. This allocation may be different to the MA applied at the portfolio level. Aviva applies an MA to certain obligations in UK Life, using methodology which is set out in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR). The MA used for 2022 UK new business (where applicable) was 125 bps (2021: 85 bps).",

PVNBP is derived from the present value of new regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts plus 100% of single premiums from new business written in the financial period and is expressed at the point of sale. The discounted value of regular premiums is calculated using the same methodology as for VNB.

Under IFRS, only the margin earned from non-participating investment contracts is recognised in the IFRS income statement\n- 6. The non-GAAP measure of sales focuses on new business written in the period under review while the IFRS income statement includes premiums received from all business, both new and existing\n\n## Annual Premium Equivalent (APE)\n\nAPE is a measure of sales in our life insurance business. APE is calculated as the sum of new regular premiums plus 10% of new single premiums written in the period. This provides useful information on sales and new business when considered alongside VNB.\n\n## Solvency II operating own funds generation (Solvency II OFG)\n\nSolvency II operating own funds generation measures the amount of Solvency II own funds generated from operating activities and incorporates an expected return on investments supporting the life and non-life insurance businesses. Solvency II operating own funds generation is used to assess sustainable growth. The Group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the Group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items.\n\nThe expected investment returns assumed within Solvency II OFG are consistent with the returns used for Group adjusted operating profit. Solvency II OFG includes the effect of variances in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions (for example, longevity) and model changes that are non-economic in nature.\n\nConsistent with the Group adjusted operating profit APM, Solvency II OFG and Solvency II OCG exclude economic variances and economic assumption changes.\n\nSolvency II operating own funds generation is the own funds component of Solvency II OCG (see below).\n\n## Solvency II operating capital generation (Solvency II OCG)\n\nSolvency II operating capital generation (Solvency II OCG) measures the amount of Solvency II capital the Group generates from operating activities. Capital generated enhances Solvency II surplus which can be used to support sustainable cash remittances from our businesses, which in turn, supports the Group's dividend as well as funding further investment to provide sustainable growth.\n\nSolvency II OCG reflects Solvency II OFG and operating movements in the SCR including the impact of capital actions, for example, strategic changes in asset mix including changes in hedging exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is also based on a linear run-off of the TMTP. These items may affect the actual amount of Solvency II OCG earned from existing business in future periods.\n\nFor business subject to short contract boundaries under Solvency II, allowance has been made for the impact of renewal premiums as and when they are expected to occur.\n\nThe projected surplus, which is primarily expected to arise from the release of risk margin (including transitional measures) and solvency capital requirement as the business runs off over time, is expected to emerge through Solvency II OCG in future years.\n\nThe cash flows are real-world cash flows, i.e. they are based on best estimate non-economic assumptions used in the Solvency II valuation and real-world investment returns rather than risk-free. The expected investment returns are consistent with the methodology used in the Group adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Solvency II return on equity (Solvency II RoE)\n\nSolvency II RoE is used as an economic value measure by the Group to assess growth and performance.\n\nSolvency II RoE is calculated as:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating own funds generation less preference dividends, equity RT1 notes coupons and excluding the return on excess capital above target capital, adjusted to replace the run-off of TMTP with the economic cost of holding TMTP (calculated as Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital plus 1-yr swap rate, multiplied by the opening TMTP on a shareholder basis), divided by:\n- \u00b7 Opening Unrestricted tier 1 shareholder Solvency II own funds adjusted to exclude excess capital. Excess capital is derived as Solvency II shareholder own funds in excess of those needed to meet our target shareholder cover ratio (currently 180%).\n\nThe denominator better reflects the long-term target Solvency II shareholder cover ratio which removes distortions in the evaluation of growth and performance that would otherwise arise where the Group is temporarily holding excess capital.\n\nSolvency II RoE is calculated on an annualised basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is calculated on an annualised basis.\n\nSolvency II RoC is calculated as:\n\n- \u00b7 Operating own funds generation adjusted to replace the run-off of TMTP with the economic cost of holding TMTP (calculated as Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital plus 1-yr swap rate) multiplied by the opening TMTP on a shareholder basis), divided by:\n- \u00b7 Opening shareholder Solvency II own funds.\n\nFor UK general insurance only, capital held for internal risk appetite purposes is used instead of opening shareholder Solvency II own funds. This removes any distortions arising from our general insurance legal entity structure and therefore ensures consistency in measuring performance across markets. This is only applicable to UK general insurance Solvency II return on capital and not to the aggregated Group Solvency II return on equity measure.\n\nA reconciliation of Solvency II return on capital by market to Group return on equity is provided below.\n\n| 2022                                                                                       | Solvency II  OFG (post  TMTP  adjustment) \u00a3m   | Opening  shareholder  own funds \u00a3m   | Solvency II  return on  capital/equity %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Business Solvency II return on capital                                                     |                                                |                                      |                                            |\n| UK & Ireland Life                                                                          | 1,432                                          | 13,830                               | 10.4%                                      |\n| UK & Ireland General Insurance 1                                                           | 293                                            | 2,339                                | 12.5%                                      |\n| Canada                                                                                     | 325                                            | 1,746                                | 18.6%                                      |\n| Aviva Investors                                                                            | 24                                             | 400                                  | 6.0%                                       |\n| UK, Ireland, Canada and Aviva Investors                                                    | 2,074                                          | 18,315                               | 11.3%                                      |\n| International investments                                                                  | 106                                            | 982                                  | 10.8%                                      |\n| Discontinued operations                                                                    | -                                              | -                                    | - %                                        |\n| Reconciliation to Group Solvency II return on equity                                       |                                                |                                      |                                            |\n| Corporate centre costs and Other 1                                                         | (279)                                          | 2,853                                | N/A                                        |\n| Less: Senior and subordinated debt                                                         | (214)                                          | (5,880)                              | - %                                        |\n| Less: Adjustment to remove excess capital above target Solvency II shareholder cover ratio | (11)                                           | (5,813)                              | - %                                        |\n| Less: RT1 coupon and Preference shares 2                                                   | (55)                                           | (450)                                | - %                                        |\n| Less: Net deferred tax assets                                                              | -                                              | (123)                                | - %                                        |\n| Solvency II return on equity at 31 December                                                | 1,621                                          | 9,884                                | 16.4%                                      |\n\n- 2.

Dividend payments by operating businesses may be subject to insurance regulations that restrict the amount that can be paid. The business monitors total cash remittances at a Group level and in each of its businesses. Cash remittances are considered a useful measure as they support the payments of external dividends. Cash remittances eliminate on consolidation and hence are not directly reconcilable to the Group's IFRS consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nIn 2022 a review was undertaken of the basis of allocation of remittances from Aviva's internal reinsurance vehicle. From April 2022, remittances are allocated to business units using an aggregate capital basis, previously remittances were allocated on a first in, first out basis.\n\n## Excess centre cash flow\n\nThis represents the cash remitted by business units to the Group centre less central operating expenses and debt financing costs. Excess centre cash flow is a measure of the cash available to pay dividends, reduce debt or invest back into our business. Excess centre cash flow does not include cash movements such as disposal proceeds or capital injections. Excess centre cash flow when positive in the period can be referred to as excess centre cash inflows and when negative as excess centre cash outflows.\n\n## Centre liquidity\n\nCentre liquidity comprises cash and liquid assets and represents amounts as at the end of the month preceding results announcements. It provides meaningful information because it shows the liquidity at the Group centre available to meet debt interest and central costs and to pay dividends to shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Cautionary Statement\n\nThis document should be read in conjunction with the documents distributed by Aviva plc (the 'Company' or 'Aviva') through The Regulatory News Service (RNS). This announcement contains, and we may make other verbal or written 'forward-looking statements' with respect to certain of Aviva's plans and current goals and expectations relating to future financial condition, performance, results, strategic initiatives and objectives (including, without limitation, climate-related plans and goals). Statements containing the words 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'projects', 'plans', 'will', 'seeks', 'aims', 'may', 'could', 'outlook', 'likely', 'target', 'goal', 'guidance', 'trends', 'future', 'estimates', 'potential', 'objective', 'predicts', 'ambition' and 'anticipates', and words of similar meaning, are forward-looking. By their nature, all forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. Aviva believes factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements in the announcement include, but are not limited to: the impact of ongoing uncertain conditions in the global financial markets and the national and international political and economic situation generally (including those arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict); market developments and government actions (including those arising from the evolving relationship between the UK and the EU); the effect of credit spread volatility on the net unrealised value of the investment portfolio; the effect of losses due to defaults by counterparties, including potential sovereign debt defaults or restructurings, on the value of our investments; reduce the value or yield of our investment portfolio and impact our asset and liability matching; the impact of changes in short or long-term inflation; the impact of changes in equity or property prices on our investment portfolio; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; the effect of market fluctuations on the value of options and guarantees embedded in some of our life insurance products and the value of the assets backing their reserves; the amount of allowances and impairments taken on our investments; the effect of adverse capital and credit market conditions on our ability to meet liquidity needs and our access to capital; changes in, or restrictions on, our ability to initiate capital management initiatives; changes in or inaccuracy of assumptions in pricing and reserving for insurance business (particularly with regard to mortality and morbidity trends, lapse rates and policy renewal rates), longevity and endowments; a cyclical downturn of the insurance industry; the impact of natural and man-made catastrophic events (including the longer-term impact of COVID-19) on our business activities and results of operations; the transitional, litigation and physical risks associated with climate change; failure to understand and respond effectively to the risks associated with environmental, social or governance ('ESG') factors; our reliance on information and technology and third-party service providers for our operations and systems; the impact of the Group's risk mitigation strategies proving less effective than anticipated, including the inability of reinsurers to meet obligations or unavailability of reinsurance coverage; poor investment performance of the Group's asset management business; the withdrawal by customers at short notice of assets under the Group's management; failure to manage risks in operating securities lending of Group and third-party client assets; increased competition in the UK and in other countries where we have significant operations; regulatory approval of changes to the Group's internal model for calculation of regulatory capital under the UK's version of Solvency II rules; the impact of actual experience differing from estimates used in valuing and amortising deferred acquisition costs (DAC) and acquired value of in-force business (AVIF); the impact of recognising an impairment of our goodwill or intangibles with indefinite lives; changes in valuation\n\nmethodologies, estimates and assumptions used in the valuation of investment securities; the effect of legal proceedings and regulatory investigations; the impact of operational risks, including inadequate or failed internal and external processes, systems and human error or from external events and malicious acts (including cyber attack and theft, loss or misuse of customer data); risks associated with arrangements with third parties, including joint ventures; our reliance on third-party distribution channels to deliver our products; funding risks associated with our participation in defined benefit staff pension schemes; the failure to attract or retain the necessary key personnel; the effect of systems errors or regulatory changes on the calculation of unit prices or deduction of charges for our unitlinked products that may require retrospective compensation to our customers; the effect of simplifying our operating structure and activities; the effect of a decline in any of our ratings by rating agencies on our standing among customers, broker-dealers, agents, wholesalers and other distributors of our products and services; changes to our brand and reputation; changes in tax laws and interpretation of existing tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business; changes to International Financial Reporting Standards relevant to insurance companies and their interpretation (for example, IFRS 17); the inability to protect our intellectual property; the effect of undisclosed liabilities, separation issues and other risks associated with our business disposals; and other uncertainties, such as diversion of management attention and other resources, relating to future acquisitions, combinations or disposals within relevant industries; the policies, decisions and actions of government or regulatory authorities in the UK, the EU, the US, Canada or elsewhere, including changes to and the implementation of key legislation and regulation (for example, FCA Consumer Duty and Solvency II). Please see Aviva's most recent Annual Report and Accounts for further details of risks, uncertainties and other factors relevant to the business and its securities.\n\nAviva undertakes no obligation to update the forward looking statements in this announcement or any other forward-looking statements we may make. Forward-looking statements in this report are current only as of the date on which such statements are made. The climate metrics used in this document should be treated with special caution, as they are more uncertain than, for example, historical financial information and given the wider uncertainty around the evolution and impact of climate change. Climate metrics include estimates of historical emissions and historical climate change and forward-looking climate metrics (such as ambitions, targets, climate scenarios and climate projections and forecasts). Our understanding of climate change and its impact continue to evolve. Accordingly, both historical and forward-looking climate metrics are inherently uncertain and, therefore, less decision-useful than metrics based on historical financial statements.\n\nThis report has been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company, as a body, and no other persons.
