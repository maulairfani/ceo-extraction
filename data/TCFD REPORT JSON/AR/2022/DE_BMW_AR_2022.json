This report is intended to provide qualified insight into the BMW/uni00A0Group and explain our activities in a transparent, comprehensible and measurable manner. We are keen to demonstrate to our stake/uni00AD holders how economic, ecological and social issues complement one another and are often mutually dependent, and to identify the general external conditions that influence the Company. For these reasons, we explain /uni2197/uni00A0the BMW/uni00A0Group's integrated strategy as well as the latest developments and the way in which the business is managed on the basis of key financial and non/uni00AD financial targets. /uni2197/uni00A0Dashboard\n\nOn 7 March 2023, the Financial Statements of BMW/uni00A0AG were prepared and the Group Financial Statements were approved for publication by the Board of Management. The BMW/uni00A0Group Report (hereinafter also 'the Report') combines the management reports  of  Bayerische  Motoren  Werke  Aktiengesellschaft (BMW/uni00A0AG) and the BMW/uni00A0Group in a Combined Management Report.\n\nThe report is divided into the following sections:\n\n- 1 - To Our Stakeholders\n- 2 - Combined Management Report\n- 3 - Group Financial Statements\n- 4 - Responsibility Statement and Auditor's Report\n- 5 - Remuneration Report\n- 6 - Other Information\n\n## Changes in reporting and outlook for reporting requirements\n\nIn light of recent and prospective changes in non/uni00ADfinancial dis/uni00AD closure requirements, in particular the standards of the ISSB and CSRD at the EU level, the pace of change within the reporting environment will continue to gather momentum and increase the extent to which non/uni00ADfinancial and financial disclosures need to be presented on an integrated basis. The BMW/uni00A0Group is prepar/uni00AD ing itself for these new trends by continually developing its Inter/uni00AD nal Control System to ensure that select non/uni00ADfinancial performance indicators are monitored to the same degree as financial perfor/uni00AD mance indicators. With this BMW/uni00A0Group Report, we also fulfil the disclosure requirements set out by the /uni2197/uni00A0 EU Taxonomy .\n\n/uni2197 /uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD4\n\n## FRAMEWORKS APPLIED\n\nThe BMW Group Report is based on the following reporting and accounting standards.\n\n## Combined Management Report\n\nThe Combined Management Report is based on the following legal frameworks:\n\n- - German Commercial Code (HGB) (among other relevant legislation)\n- - Content of the Management Report in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 289 and 315 HGB\n- - Combined Non/uni00ADFinancial Statement (NFS) at Group and Company level in accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0289/uni00A0b and \u00a7/uni00A0315/uni00A0b HGB ( /uni2197 /uni00A0NFS Index )\n- - German Accounting Standards (GAS 20) underpinning HGB requirements\n- - German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n- - Taxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/uni200A/852 of the European Council and of the European Parliament on the Establishment of a Framework to Facilitate Sustainable Investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/uni200A/2088)",

        "page_content": "The Combined Management Report is also based on:\n\n- - Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)\n- - German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC)\n\nFurthermore, the Combined Management Report makes reference to  the  following  reporting  standards  and  transparency requirements:\n\n- - GRI Standards 2021 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) ( /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index )\n- - SASB Standards according to the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board ( /uni2197/uni00A0SASB Index )\n- - Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate/uni00ADrelated Fi/uni00AD nancial Disclosures (TCFD) ( /uni2197 TCFD Index )\n- - UN Global Compact Progress Report: see references in GRI requirements ( /uni2197 GRI Index )\n\n## Group Financial Statements\n\nThe Group Financial Statements of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft for the year ended 31/uni00A0December 2022 have been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and the supplementary requirements of \u00a7/uni00A0315 e HGB.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE REPORT\n\n## Publication and scope\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group Report is published annually to coincide with the BMW Group Annual Conference - most recently held on 15 March 2022 - and is subsequently available in both German and English on the BMW/uni00A0Group website. The /uni2197 GRI Index is also available on the website as a separate document. The reporting period covers the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022. The statements made in the report relate to the BMW/uni00A0Group reporting entity.  Any deviations are marked accordingly. The structure of the BMW/uni00A0Group changed significantly on 11/uni00A0February 2022 due to the BMW/uni00A0Group's increased stake in the former joint venture BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW/uni00A0Brilliance) and its subsequent inclusion in the BMW/uni00A0Group reporting entity. Further information on the first/uni00ADtime consolidation is available in /uni2197/uni00A0note 3 to the Group Financial Statements. The BMW/uni00A0Group Report 2023 will be published on 20 March 2024.\n\n## /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD2, 2/uni00AD3, 2/uni00AD4\n\n## External audit\n\nThe entire report of BMW/uni00A0AG, comprising the Combined Man/uni00AD agement Report, the Group Financial Statements and the further GRI Information, is subjected to an annual independent audit by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft ('PwC' or 'Auditor'). Unaudited sections are marked according/uni00AD ly. The external audit serves to underpin the reliability and trust/uni00AD worthiness of the information contained therein for the public. The external audit supports the Supervisory Board of BMW/uni00A0AG in fulfilling its auditing duties. Any links and disclosures that  refer to information outside the BMW /uni00A0Group Report and the GRI Index\n\nare not part of the audit. The /uni2197/uni00A0Remuneration Report 2022 was pre/uni00AD pared in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7/uni00A0162 of the  German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and its content audited by PwC.\n\nPwC has audited the Group Financial Statements and the Com/uni00AD bined Management Report for the year under report and issued an unqualified audit opinion thereupon. Further information is provided in the /uni2197 Independent Auditor's Report and the /uni2197 Independent Practitioner's Report on Non/uni00ADfinancial Disclosures.\n\nThe contents of the NFS, in accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0289/uni00A0b and \u00a7/uni00A0315/uni00A0b HGB, were subjected to an audit to obtain limited assurance and are denoted with the symbol /uni200A .../uni200A . The section /uni2197 Dialogue with Stakeholders and the additional information provided in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Further GRI Information were also subjected to a limited assurance engagement. Certain individual parts of the /uni2197 NFS as well as the remainder of the Combined Management Report were subjected to a reasonable assurance engagement. Information provided in the /uni2197 SASB Index is subjected to a limited assurance review on a voluntary basis. The /uni2197/uni00A0TCFD Index indicates the sections in which the depth of the audit is identified.",

        "page_content": "## Materiality analysis\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group carried out a materiality analysis in 2022 in ac/uni00AD cordance with \u00a7/uni00A0289/uni00A0c and \u00a7/uni00A0315/uni00A0c HGB. This three/uni00ADstep process involved the preparation of a long list of topics that are  internally and externally relevant for the BMW/uni00A0Group. These topics were then prioritised in consultation with external stakeholders and in consideration of competition analyses and rating requirements. The topics that were ultimately categorised as material were those where the actions of the BMW/uni00A0Group may have a significant sustainability impact on the environment and society (inside/uni00ADout) and which may be of high business relevance to the BMW/uni00A0Group (outside/uni00ADin). The findings were subsequently validated in an in/uni00AD ternal management workshop. As a result, our focus is on alter/uni00AD native drive systems /uni2197/uni00A0Electromobility , Decarbonisation along the value chain /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions , responsible sourcing /uni2197/uni00A0Purchasing and Supplier Network , resource management in line with the prin/uni00AD ciple of the /uni2197/uni00A0circular economy as well as compliance /uni2197/uni00A0and Compli/uni00AD ance and/uni00A0Human Rights . Employee diversity and equal/uni00A0opportunity /uni2197/uni00A0  Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion as well as an/uni00A0attractive workplace /uni2197/uni00A0Employer Attractiveness and Employee  Development are also given high priority within the BMW Group. In accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which must be applied from financial year 2024, topics are material when they (may) have a significant sustainability impact or be of high business relevance. The additional topics in this context are responsible digitalisation /uni2197/uni00A0 Innovation, Digitalisation and/uni00A0Customer Orientation , Product and Road Safety, /uni2197/uni00A0Product   Quality and Safety , /uni2197 Health and Performance , and Sustainable Governance /uni2197 Performance Management . The GRI reporting refers to topics that are relevant pursuant to the CSRD.\n\n## Connection to figures in the Group Financial Statements\n\nFor each topic, an assessment was carried out to identify figures reported in the financial statements that enable a better under/uni00AD standing of the NFS, and which therefore need to be disclosed and explained.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nWith its business operations, the BMW/uni00A0Group is in a position to contribute directly to the achievement of Sustainable Develop/uni00AD ment Goals (SDGs), in particular /uni2197/uni00A0SDG 3, 8, 9, 12 and 13 . Icons will be used at the start of each section to provide a visual reference to these SDGs.\n\n## Forward/uni00ADlooking statements\n\nThis report contains various forward/uni00ADlooking statements con/uni00AD cerning future developments that are based on the current status of the BMW/uni00A0Group's assumptions and forecasts. These state/uni00AD ments are therefore subject to a variety of predictable and un/uni00AD predictable risks, uncertainties and other factors, which means that the actual outcome, including that of the BMW Group's net/uni00A0 assets, financial position and results of operations, its development or performance, could differ considerably from those statements.\n\n## Statement on Corporate Governance\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of BMW/uni00A0AG prepare a yearly combined Statement on Corporate Governance in accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0289/uni00A0f and \u00a7/uni00A0315/uni00A0d HGB to re/uni00AD port  on corporate governance within the Company and the BMW /uni00A0Group. The Statement on Corporate Governance is pub/uni00AD lished on BMW/uni00A0AG's website at /uni2197 www.bmwgroup.com/ezu . It also includes the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7/uni00A0161 AktG.\n\n## Editorial comments\n\nThe key figures included in the BMW Group Report have been rounded in accordance with standard commercial practice. In individual cases, this may mean that figures do not add up ex/uni00AD actly to the stated total and that percentages cannot be derived from the values shown.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group Report uses the simplified term 'carbon' or the abbreviation CO2 instead of CO2e; see the glossary under /uni2197 CO2e/CO2 equivalents . Summarised disclosures of fuel consump/uni00AD tion, carbon emissions and electricity consumption are provided in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Consumption and Carbon Disclosures .",

1 The figures for 2018 were adjusted due to the change in accounting policy in conjunction with the adoption of IFRS 16 (/uni2197/uni00A0Annual Report 2019, Note [6] to the Group Financial Statements).\n- 2 The term 'employee' has been redefined with effect from the reporting year 2020 (for definition, see /uni2197/uni00A0Glossary). The figure for 2019 was restated accordingly for comparison purposes (2019 before adjustment: 133,778 employees). For the period 2018 and earlier, the share of employees that are no longer reflected in reporting is between 7.5 % and 8.0 %.\n- 3 The new definition of the term 'employee' (see footnote 1) also has an impact on disclosures relating to the percentage of female employees. The 2019 figure was adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes (2019 before adjustment: 17.5 %).\n- 4 The term 'RoCE' has been redefined with effect from the reporting year 2022 (for definition, see /uni2197/uni00A0Glossary). The 2021 figure was adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes (2021 before adjustment: 59.9 %).\n- 5 Deliveries including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., also for the period prior to full consolidation in the Group Financial Statements of the BMW Group (2018: 455,581 units, 2019: 538,612 units, 2020: 602,247 units, 2021: 651,236 units, 1 January to 10 February 2022: 96,133 units).\n- 6 EU/uni00AD27 countries including Norway and Iceland; with effect from 2021, values are calculated on a converted basis in line with WLTP (Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicles Test Procedure). Values for 2018 to 2020 were calculated based on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC).\n- 7 This is a preliminary internal calculation with a potential variation of +/- 0.5 g CO2/km, as official registration figures from the authorities are not available for all EU states. Figures officially published by the EU Commission are not expected to be available until November of the following year.\n- 8 Including an allowance for eco/uni00ADinnovations (amounts of clearly minor significance).\n- 9 To improve comparability, the 2020 NEDC figures were converted to WLTP after adjusting for permissible flexibilities - specifically from 99 g CO2/km according to NEDC (including 5 g CO2/km phase/uni00ADin, 7.5 g CO2/km supercredits and 2.4 g CO2/km eco/uni00ADinnovations) to 135 g CO2/km according to WLTP (excluding/uni00A0flexibilities). In 2020, a phase/uni00ADin regulation was accepted, as was the recognition of supercredits, which ceased in 2021.\n- 10 Efficiency ratio calculated on the basis of Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions (i.e. a market/uni00ADbased method according to GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly based on the use of emissions factors for electricity, district heating and fuels of the VDA (each in the most current valid version: 12/2022) and occasionally using local emissions factors; excluding climate/uni00ADchanging gases other than carbon dioxide from vehicle production (BMW/uni00A0Group manufacturing sites including the BMW/uni00A0Brilliance Automotive Ltd. joint venture and Motorrad, but excluding partner plants and contract manufacturers), as well as BMW/uni00A0Group non/uni00ADmanufacturing sites (e.g. research centres, sales centres, office buildings) divided by the number of vehicles produced (BMW/uni00A0Group manufacturing sites including the BMW/uni00A0Brilliance Automotive Ltd. joint venture and partner plants, but excluding contract manufacturers).\n- 11 From 2019, this indicator includes the carbon emissions of all other BMW/uni00A0Group locations in addition to the carbon emissions generated by production. The figure for 2018 cannot be compared directly.\n- 12 The 2018 figure was audited on the basis of a limited assurance engagement.\n- 13 The term 'RoCE' has been redefined with effect from the reporting year 2022 (for definition, see /uni2197/uni00A0Glossary). The 2021 figure was adjusted accordingly for comparison purposes (2021 before adjustment: 35.9 %).",

The ongoing war in Ukraine is a human tragedy that moves us all deeply. In economic terms, too, the conflict has had a massive impact, with severe repercussions for vital supply chains. The general situation was also exacerbated by repeated lockdowns in China and numerous bottlenecks affecting semiconductor availability. However, despite these adverse geo political and macroeconomic circumstances, the BMW/uni00A0Group performed well in 2022 within the competitive environment. With around 2.4/uni00A0million vehicles sold and the production of/uni00A0all/uni00ADelectric vehicles making good progress, the BMW/uni00A0Group has clearly demonstrated that a strong product portfolio is the best response to a challenging environment.\n\nWe got off to a flying start in 2023 with the unveiling of the BMW i Vision Dee at the Con/uni00AD sumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 'Dee' stands for Digital Emotional Experience, a new/uni00A0form of interaction between people and their cars in which genuine driving pleasure and the virtual world merge seamlessly. With this vehicle, BMW has already arrived in the future in terms of digitalisation!\n\nFor 2023, we intend to maintain our firm course of profitable growth and press ahead with the ramping up of electric mobility. We are convinced that the future of the BMW/uni00A0Group is electric, digital and circular - and it has already begun!",

        "page_content": "## Focus of Supervisory Board activities during the past financial year\n\nThe Supervisory Board performed the duties incumbent upon it with the utmost diligence throughout the financial year 2022.\n\nBased on in/uni00ADdepth reports presented by the Board of Management, in our capacity as a supervisory body we assiduously monitored the governance of the BMW/uni00A0Group and advised the Board of Management on matters relating to the management and strategic develop/uni00AD ment of the Group. We focused in particular on the progressive electrification of the Group's product portfolio and on implementing the corporate strategies adopted in the fields of digitalisation and sustainability. At each of the five plenary sessions of the Supervisory Board (including two two/uni00ADday meetings), we held detailed discussions with the Board of/uni00A0Management regarding the Group's situation, addressing a variety of topics, including the risks associated with the ongoing global uncertainty and risk management. The Board/uni00A0of Management also kept the Supervisory Board well informed of any matters of significance outside the framework of formal meetings. I also discussed key current matters personally with the Chairman of the Board of Management between meetings on a regular basis. In addition to scheduled meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee was also in direct contact with the Board of Management member responsible for Finance as well as with the external  auditor's representatives. Furthermore, we regularly dealt with personnel/uni00ADrelated matters as well as/uni00A0internal Supervisory Board issues without the presence of the Board of Management.\n\nWithin the Supervisory Board and its committees, dialogues were always conducted in an open and constructive spirit, both internally and together with members of the Board of Management. Detailed documents distributed in a timely manner prior to meetings enabled members to prepare appropriately for the topics up for discussion. In addition, separate preliminary meetings of the shareholder and employee representatives were held on a regular basis prior to Supervisory Board meetings.\n\nIn its reports on the BMW Group's position , the Board of Management kept us well informed at each meeting regarding current developments and the Group's overall perfor/uni00AD mance. A regular topic of discussion was the development of current sales trends based on/uni00A0figures analysed by brand, segment and market region for both the BMW/uni00A0Group and its competitors, with a keen focus on electrified vehicles. An overview of key financial indica/uni00AD tors and the liquidity situation of the BMW Group was also an integral part of these reports. In view of the far/uni00ADreaching consequences of the war in Ukraine, including the impact on business in/uni00A0Russia and the recurrent coronavirus /uni00ADrelated lockdowns in China, we were pro/uni00AD vided with up/uni00ADto/uni00ADdate information on current  developments, risks to business performance\n\nand risk management measures on a regular basis. The latest developments in the semi/uni00AD conductor supply situation were also  discussed at each meeting.\n\nThe monitoring of corporate strategy also remained high on the Supervisory Board's agenda. The Board of Management provided an in/uni00ADdepth account of its strategies, focus/uni00AD ing on the automotive sector's transformation in the fields of electrification, digitalisation and the circular economy and emphasising the importance of the NEUE KLASSE as a huge leap in terms of product features. The latest purchasing strategies in place were also explained to us in great depth. Growing challenges in relation to supply chain management and the ongoing trend towards technology clusters were both discussed at considerable length. Particular attention was paid to the Catena/uni00ADX platform, a cross/uni00ADcompany network designed to improve supply security and carbon emissions management throughout the/uni00A0supply chain using standardised data exchange systems. The overall market situation as well as the outlook for automated driving were also subjects of the Board of Manage/uni00AD ment's reports. In conjunction with the information provided on the topic of sustainability, the Board of Management reaffirmed the BMW Group's ambitious decarbonisation targets for the year 2030.\n\nAt each meeting, the Board of Management updated us on the current status of its strategy/uni00AD and project/uni00ADrelated work as well as the progress being made in implementing its declared strategy of environmental sustainability. These updates also included current events such as the opening of the Lydia plant in China, which is fully geared to e/uni00ADmobility production, the start of production of fuel cell systems at the BMW Group's in/uni00ADhouse competence centre for hydrogen in Munich, the market launch of the all/uni00ADelectric BMW iX1 as well as the found/uni00AD ing of the 'Circular Republic' initiative in collaboration with UnternehmerTUM GmbH on all aspects of the circular economy.\n\nMoreover, the Board of Management reported to us on other current topics, such as the highly successful presentation of the new BMW 7 Series in Palm Springs, USA, the activi/uni00AD ties surrounding the 100th anniversary of the BMW plant and the 50th anniversary of the/uni00A0BMW Group's 'Vierzylinder' tower in Munich, the unveiling of the Spectre, the first all/uni00ADelectric Rolls/uni00ADRoyce, and the eight IQS Quality Awards received for five of our vehicle models as well as three of the BMW Group's plants.\n\nOn several occasions we deliberated on major changes affecting the legal framework and/or regulatory projects that are of significance to the BMW/uni00A0Group, in particular the EU's/uni00A0regulations regarding fleet carbon emissions in conjunction with the EU's 'Fit for 55' package and the Euro 7 emissions standards.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the Supervisory Board closely monitored developments relating to major strategic cooperations . In 2022, the focus was particularly on the Chinese market, with respect to both the BMW Brilliance Automotive joint venture, in which the BMW/uni00A0Group was able to increase its share to 75 % with effect from 11 February 2022, and the cooperation with Great Wall Motors for the local production of an all/uni00ADelectric MINI. The Board of Manage/uni00AD ment updated us on the current status of these projects at each meeting. In light of the sale of SHARE/uni00A0NOW, we were also kept informed of strategic developments at YOUR/uni00A0NOW as well as the strengthening of the BMW/uni00A0Group's luxury segment product range through the acquisition of the ALPINA brand.\n\nThe development of the BMW Group's equity and considerations undertaken by the Board of Management regarding the possible implementation of a share buyback pro/uni00AD gramme were further key items on our agenda. Based on the rationale provided by the Board of Management, we approved the resolution proposed to the Annual General Meeting to authorise the acquisition of treasury shares. At the same time, the Supervisory Board stipulated a requirement to obtain the Supervisory Board's approval in certain cases of share buybacks and assigned responsibility for deciding on such approval to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviewed the targeted, maximum and expected level of Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2022 in light of the BMW Group's busi/uni00AD ness performance as well as the multi/uni00ADyear remuneration trend of its senior executives and employees within Germany. Based on a comparative study conducted by an external inde/uni00AD pendent remuneration consultant and subsequent oral advice, we concluded that both the remuneration paid to Board of Management members for the financial year 2021 and the target remuneration for 2022 are appropriate. In December 2022, following thorough prepa/uni00AD ration by the Personnel Committee, we adopted the variable remuneration targets appli/uni00AD cable to Board of Management members for the financial year 2023, taking into account the budget for 2023, the long/uni00ADterm business plan and the Group's corporate strategy. Detailed information on Board of Management remuneration for the financial year 2022 is provided in the Remuneration Report.\n\nIn addition, we deliberated upon key issues arising within the Board of Management's various key areas of responsibility in the course of our work. We carefully considered the/uni00A0planned realignment of the BMW Group's retail operations in specified regions to an agency model based on a presentation explaining the objectives, implementation steps and plans for individual European markets. The European market as a whole was also the subject of an in/uni00ADdepth sales report.\n\nThe fundamental structures of the BMW/uni00A0Group's risk management system as well as the key elements of its risk strategy were clearly set out for us in the detailed Risk Report. In addition, various scenarios and risk mitigation measures were discussed regarding a range of topics of current relevance for the key areas Development, Purchasing, Production and Sales. The Board of Management also reported to us on the strategy, performance, sector/uni00AD specific risk profile and current projects of the Financial Services line of business. Key topics relating to the Group's financing system were also discussed at length.\n\nDuring the year under report, we reviewed the strategies pursued by Human Resources, including maintaining the attractiveness of the BMW/uni00A0Group as an employer. The Board of Management also brought us up to date on the current status of the diversity concepts developed by the Group and the extent to which targets have been achieved regarding the proportion of women employed at various levels.\n\nWe also gave thorough consideration to the current status, maturity and evolution of the Group's compliance management system. In his annual report, the Chief Compliance Officer presented the key stages of development that have been defined for this system and provided an insight into a number of individual projects, including in particular the implementation of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.\n\nIn December 2021, the Supervisory Board agreed to the initial plan to hold the 2022 Annual General Meeting on a virtual basis in the wake of the Covid/uni00AD19 pandemic and in March 2022, the detailed concept proposed by the Board of Management was approved. In Decem/uni00AD ber 2022, the Supervisory Board also agreed to hold the 2023 Annual General Meeting on/uni00A0a/uni00A0virtual basis, particularly in view of the higher level of planning certainty and the lower consumption of resources. In this context, it will be ensured that shareholders can exercise their rights on an equivalent basis to an AGM held in person.\n\nI personally hold discussions with investor representatives on topics specific to the Super/uni00AD visory Board on a regular basis. Key topics discussed during the past financial year included corporate/uni00ADgovernance/uni00ADrelevant issues such as targets for the composition of the Super/uni00AD visory Board, the Remuneration Report and arrangements for the Annual General Meeting. Another topic of these discussions was the  Supervisory Board's dealing with the corpo/uni00AD rate strategy, in particular with regard to sustainability targets set by the BMW Group.",

        "page_content": "The BMW Group's long/uni00ADterm business plan was subjected to comprehensive examination. Focusing on the transformation towards sustainable mobility, the Board of Management presented its forecasts for the various segments as well as ambitious long/uni00ADterm targets set for the Group. The key targets of profitable growth across all segments and sales growth of/uni00A0all/uni00ADelectric models were both reaffirmed. The Board of Management also reported on financial planning as well as opportunity and risk scenarios pertaining to the Automotive segment. Following thorough examination, the Supervisory Board approved the long/uni00ADterm business plan drawn up by the Board of Management.\n\nIn December, the Board of Management presented the budget for the financial year 2023. After detailed discussion with the Board of Management, including the particular challenges in view of the uncertain and volatile overall situation, we gave our approval to this docu/uni00AD ment as well.\n\nBased on the new version of the German Corporate Governance Code, we have continued to develop the BMW/uni00A0Group's system of corporate governance , including a revision of the/uni00A0competence profile stipulated for the Supervisory Board as one particular contribution. A qualification matrix showing each individual Supervisory Board member's areas of expertise is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on the BMW/uni00A0Group web/uni00AD site. Based on a self/uni00ADassessment, we concluded that the composition of the Supervisory Board/uni00A0at 31/uni00A0December 2022 fully meets the targets stipulated in the diversity concept and the competency profile.\n\nIn light of the major significance attached to sustainability/uni00ADrelated topics, the tasks assigned to the Audit Committee and the Presiding Board in this respect have now been delineated more clearly in our Rules of Procedure.\n\nIn the Declaration of Compliance with the German Corporate Governance Code issued in December 2022, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board confirmed that they have complied with the recommendations of the Code as amended on 16 December 2019 without exception. Moreover, we have fully complied with the recommendations contained in the latest version of the Code dated 28 April 2022 and intend to continue doing so going forward.\n\nWith BMW/uni00A0AG's support, Supervisory Board members received further training on various topics during 2022. In March, for instance, in training sessions with representatives of the auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (PwC), we took an in/uni00ADdepth look at current and future frameworks applicable for non/uni00ADfinancial reporting and familiarised ourselves with EU Taxonomy regulations. At our two/uni00ADday meeting held in July, our agenda also gave us the opportunity to gain an insight into digital, AI/uni00ADsupported factory planning ('BMW iFACTORY') at the Dingolfing plant, the BMW/uni00A0Group's largest pro/uni00AD duction location in Europe. In this context, we were informed about the key aspects of the 'Lean, Green, Digital' concept for sustainable, digital production systems.\n\nIn September, motivated in part by a keynote speech made by an external speaker on the/uni00A0future of e/uni00ADmobility from the perspective of an energy company and grid operator, we looked at the challenges arising relating to the availability of energy supplies on the one hand and the expansion of charging infrastructure in Germany on the other. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board members had the opportunity to test/uni00ADdrive various vehicles with different drive systems at the BMW and MINI Driving Academy in Maisach near Munich. In addition, we were given a preview of the architecture, design, display and operating con/uni00AD cept of/uni00A0the NEUE KLASSE, including a whole host of innovative features. Last but not least, in December we discussed the perception of the BMW/uni00A0Group on the capital market with an/uni00A0external capital market expert familiar with the automotive sector.\n\nThe onboarding programme for new Supervisory Board members was continued in 2022, with representatives of the Group's specialist departments taking the time to provide useful insights into the key business areas as well as the planning processes deployed at the BMW/uni00A0Group. New members were also introduced to the ongoing work of the Supervisory Board.\n\nTowards the end of 2022, we reviewed the effectiveness of the work of the Supervisory Board and its committees with the aid of a questionnaire, the results of which were dis/uni00AD cussed at the meeting. Cooperation, within the Supervisory Board itself and with the Board of Management, was unanimously assessed as being constructive and fruitful. We are already planning to follow up on a number of suggestions in 2023 with a view to increasing our understanding of specific topics, in particular individual aspects of the BMW/uni00A0Group's sustainability strategy, such as hydrogen technology and sustainable energy generation at a BMW site.",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board is careful to avoid any conflicts of interest in the course of its delib/uni00AD erations and decision/uni00ADmaking processes. No conflicts of interest were either reported or identified during the financial year 2022.\n\n## Description of Presiding Board activities and committee work\n\nThe Supervisory Board has established a Presiding Board and four committees. The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Dr Bock, and myself reported in detail on the work of the Presiding Committee as well as the committees at each of the subsequent Supervisory Board meetings. Further information on the duties, composition and working methods of the Presiding Board as well as the committees is provided in the Statement of Corporate Governance on our website.\n\nUnless a particular committee was responsible, the Presiding Board prepared the content of the topics for the plenary meetings at its four meetings in cooperation with the Board of/uni00A0Management and senior heads of department and made suggestions for topics to be reported on at Supervisory Board meetings.\n\n## The Audit Committee convened eight times in total.\n\nIn February and March 2022, the focus was on preparing the Supervisory Board meeting at which the financial statements for the financial year 2021 were discussed and examined. After considering the matter of independence, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that PwC be proposed for election as auditor at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. There were no indications of conflicts of interest, grounds for exclusion or lack of independence on the part of the auditor.\n\nThe Audit Committee concluded that PwC's fee proposal for the audit of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the BMW Group Report 2022 as well as for the review of the Half/uni00ADYear Report 2022 was appropriate in light of the scope of its tasks and issued the corresponding contracts to PwC following their election at the Annual General Meeting in May 2022. The Audit Committee also specified supplementary audit focus areas. Moreover, it approved the scope of the non/uni00ADaudit services to be performed by PwC, the progress of which was reported to us on a regular basis. At its meetings, the Audit Committee discussed the quality of the audit in depth on several occasions. In particular, it requested the relevant department to report on the Group's perception of the audits of the financial statements for the financial year 2021 as well as on the results of the survey conducted within the Group in this context. Based on this report, the auditor's description of the quality assurance meas/uni00AD ures undertaken and the Audit Committee's own experience with the auditor, the audit was found to be of good quality.\n\nWe also examined the combined Non/uni00ADfinancial Statement of BMW/uni00A0AG and the BMW/uni00A0Group for the financial year 2021, which is part of the BMW Group Report. Here, too, the represent/uni00AD atives of PwC reported to us on the findings of their audit. We have again engaged PwC to conduct a 'limited assurance' audit of the Non/uni00ADfinancial (Group) Statement for the finan/uni00AD cial year 2022, to the extent that it relates to parts of the management report that are not subject to a 'reasonable assurance' audit. Going beyond the formal review required by law, the Audit Committee also engaged PwC to audit the contents of the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2022.\n\nThe Quarterly Statements were presented by the Board of Management and discussed with the Audit Committee prior to their publication. Representatives of the external auditors were present when the Half/uni00ADYear Financial Report was discussed at the beginning of August 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit Committee considered the development of the BMW/uni00A0Group's equity and the share buyback programme 2022/2023 proposed by the Board of Management. Based on the responsibility vested in it by the Supervisory Board, the Audit Committee gave its approval to the programme in June.\n\nThe Audit Committee considered the effectiveness and appropriateness of the BMW/uni00A0Group's internal control system (including the Corporate Audit function and the compliance man/uni00AD agement system) as well as of the risk management system, focusing in particular on the current risk situation and the assessment of risk scenarios. We regularly monitor develop/uni00AD ments in the internal control system for non/uni00ADfinancial reporting, with regard to the Group's sustainability/uni00ADrelated targets. We also had Corporate Audit reports on the key findings of/uni00A0internal audits and the status of both ongoing and planned audits explained to us. The Chief Compliance Officer of the BMW/uni00A0Group reported on changes in the BMW/uni00A0Group's compliance management system in terms of strategic focus as well as on the implementa/uni00AD tion of operational measures and further planning. We also received a report on the status of/uni00A0the Tax and Customs Control System from the relevant head of department. The in/uni00ADhouse General Counsel provided us with detailed information regarding major legal disputes and proceedings. We also requested information on important product quality issues.",

        "page_content": "In its report on the audit of over/uni00ADthe/uni00ADcounter derivatives entered into by BMW/uni00A0AG during the financial year 2021, the external auditor confirmed to the Audit Committee the effectiveness of the system in place at BMW/uni00A0AG in complying with the regulatory requirements of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation.\n\nThe Audit Committee concurred with the decision of the Board of Management to raise the/uni00A0Company's share capital in accordance with Article 4 (5) of the Articles of Incorporation (Authorised Capital 2019) by \u20ac/uni00A01,439,975 and issue a corresponding number of new non/uni00AD voting bearer shares of preferred stock in conjunction with the Employee Share Programme.\n\nWithin its role as a preparatory body, in its four meetings the Personnel Committee focused on the remuneration of, and succession planning for, the Board of Management. The ap/uni00AD propriateness of Board of Management remuneration for the financial years 2021 and 2022 was reviewed, including rigorous scrutiny of the determination of the corporate earnings and performance factors applicable for Board of Management remuneration during those two years. In addition, the Personnel Committee deliberated on targets for the financial year 2023. Apart from these matters, it prepared one reappointment and one new appoint/uni00AD ment. The committee also adopted a resolution to approve loans granted by and trans/uni00AD actions concluded by BMW Bank with members of the representative bodies of BMW/uni00A0AG, and prepared for a change in the BMW/uni00A0Group's external remuneration consultant.\n\nThe Nomination Committee convened once during the financial year 2022. Taking into ac/uni00AD count the German Corporate Governance Code and the composition requirements resolved by the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee discussed the composition of the Supervisory Board regarding shareholder representatives and issued a recommendation regarding the Supervisory Board's election proposal to the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Mediation Committee , which is prescribed by law, did not need to convene during the financial year 2022.\n\n## Composition of the Board of Management\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management did not change during the financial year 2022. However, the Supervisory Board resolved to extend the term of office of one member.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board, the Presiding Board and the Supervisory Board's committees\n\nThere were no changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board during the financial year 2022 on the shareholder representative side. The Annual General Meeting elected Dr Heinrich Hiesinger to the Supervisory Board for a further term of office of approximately four years.\n\nWith regard to the employee representatives, Mr Werner Zierer retired from the Supervisory Board with effect from 31 March 2022 as well as Dr/uni00A0Thomas Wittig (as representative of the/uni00A0executive employees) with effect from 31 May 2022, in each case due to retirement. We wish to thank both gentlemen for their outstanding cooperation. We would also like to thank Mr Zierer for his dedicated work over a period of more than 20 years, and Dr Wittig for his knowledgeable support as an expert in the field of finance. Andr\u00e9 Mandl, Chairman of/uni00A0the Works Council of the Regensburg plant, was appointed as successor to Mr Zierer and Mr Gerhard Kurz, Head of Purchasing, Quality Management Drive at BMW/uni00A0AG, was ap/uni00AD pointed as successor for Dr Wittig, each for the remaining term of office and by court order.\n\nIn addition, at the end of 2022, the long/uni00ADserving First Deputy Chairman of our Supervisory Board and Chairman of the General Works Council of BMW/uni00A0AG, Mr Manfred Schoch, stepped down from the Supervisory Board to enjoy his well/uni00ADearned retirement. Mr Schoch had been a member of the Supervisory Board since 1988 and, over this long period of time, had a decisive influence on the work of the Supervisory Board thanks to his entrepre/uni00AD neurial far/uni00ADsightedness, professional competence and overall commitment to championing the best interests of the BMW/uni00A0Group and its employees. We wish to give Manfred Schoch a special vote of thanks for his life's work.\n\nIn September 2022, the Audit Committee was enlarged following the election of Rachel Empey and Dr Dominique Mohabeer, thereby improving the Committee's level of financial expertise and diversity as well as the Committee's independence. An overview of the composition of the Super visory Board and its committees is provided in the/uni00A0Statement of Corporate Governance which is available on our website together with the curricula vitae of Supervisory Board members.\n\n## Disclosure of attendance at meetings by individual members\n\nThe attendance rate at Supervisory Board meetings was 100/uni200A%, and 97/uni200A% for the meetings held by the various committees and the Presiding Board. The meetings were held on a face/uni00ADto/uni00ADface basis, with individual members participating virtually only in justified excep/uni00AD tional cases.

PwC initially conducted a review of the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and the Interim Group Man/uni00AD agement Report for the first half of 2022 and presented its findings to the Audit Committee. No issues were identified that might indicate that the condensed Interim Group Financial Statements and Interim Group Management Report had not been prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions in all material respects.\n\nThe Company Financial Statements and the Group Financial Statements of BMW/uni00A0AG for the financial year 2022, including the Combined Management Report, on which PwC has issued unqualified audit opinions, were authorised by the Board of Management on 7 March 2023. These audit opinions were signed for the fourth consecutive financial year by Petra Justenhoven as independent auditor (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin) and, for the first time, by/uni00A0Michael Popp (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer) as the auditor responsible for the performance of the engagement.\n\nAt its meeting held on 1 March 2023, the Audit Committee initially gave in/uni00ADdepth considera/uni00AD tion to the preliminary version of the Company and Group Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report (including the combined Non/uni00ADfinancial (Group) Statement and the information on EU Taxonomy) as well as the draft version of the auditor's long/uni00AD form reports.\n\nImmediately after authorising their issue, the Board of Management submitted the Company and Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2022 and the Combined Manage/uni00AD ment Report (including the Combined Non/uni00ADfinancial (Group) Statement) to the Supervisory Board. The auditor's long/uni00ADform audit reports were also submitted to the Supervisory Board in a prompt manner. In order to facilitate preparations, drafts of these documents had already been made available to the Supervisory Board in advance.\n\nAt its meeting held on 8 March 2023, the Audit Committee diligently examined and deliber/uni00AD ated on these documents before they were considered in detail at the plenary session of the Supervisory Board on 9 March 2023.\n\nAt the two respective meetings, the Board of Management provided a detailed explanation of the reporting documents to the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board. The repre/uni00AD sentatives of the external auditor reported on the main findings of their audit and answered questions put to them by members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board,",

        "page_content": "Report of the Supervisory Board\n\npartially without the members of the Board of Management being present. Both the Audit/uni00A0Committee and the Supervisory Board gave meticulous consideration to the key audit  matters and the related audit procedures.\n\nThe representatives of the external auditors confirmed that the risk management system established by the Board of Management is capable of identifying any developments that might threaten the Company's going/uni00ADconcern status at an early stage. They also confirmed that no material weaknesses in the internal control system and risk management system were identified with regard to the financial reporting process. In the course of their audit work, they did not identify any facts inconsistent with the contents of the Declaration of Compliance pursuant to \u00a7/uni00A0161 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) jointly issued by the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.\n\nBased on a thorough examination conducted by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board, we concurred with the results of the external audit. In accordance with the final result of this examination, no objections were raised. At our meeting held on 9 March 2023, we accordingly approved the Group and Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the/uni00A0financial year 2022. The Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 have therefore been adopted.\n\nFurthermore, in both the Audit Committee and the full Supervisory Board, we examined the Board of Management's proposal to use the unappropriated profit to pay a dividend of \u20ac/uni00A08.50 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend and \u20ac/uni00A08.52 for each share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend and to transfer the remaining amount to other revenue reserves. We consider the proposal appropriate and have therefore approved it.\n\nBased on the preparatory work of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management jointly prepared the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2022 in accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0162 AktG. At the request of the Audit Committee, PwC reviewed the contents of the Remuneration Report, reported to both the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board on the results of the review, and confirmed that the Remuneration Report complies with the financial reporting provisions contained in \u00a7/uni00A0162 AktG in all material respects.\n\nThe Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board also carefully examined the combined Non/uni00ADfinancial (Group) Statement for the year ended 31 December 2022. Following an in/uni00AD depth explanation of the statement by the Board of Management, representatives of PwC\n\npresented the key findings of their audit and answered additional questions posed by the members of the Supervisory Board. Based on the 'limited assurance' audit performed by PwC on those parts of the Management Report and certain sustainability disclosures in the BMW Group Report 2022 that were not subject to a reasonable assurance engagement, PWC issued an unqualified opinion, signed for the first time by Michael Popp (Wirtschafts/uni00AD pr\u00fcfer) and for the second time by Nicolette Behncke (Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin). The Supervisory Board acknowledged and approved the combined Non/uni00ADfinancial (Group) Statement drawn up by the Board of Management. Following a preparatory review conducted by the Presiding Board as well as a further review at Supervisory Board level, the Statement on Corporate Governance drawn up by the Board of Management was also approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Expression of appreciation by the Supervisory Board\n\nIn a year again marked by a set of particularly challenging circumstances, the Board of Management and the entire workforce can be proud of their achievements, which have helped take the BMW Group further along its path of automotive transformation. We there/uni00AD fore wish to express our deep thanks and appreciation to the members of the Board of Management and every single employee of the BMW/uni00A0 Group worldwide.\n\nWe are confident that the Board of Management and the BMW/uni00A0Group's workforce - moti/uni00AD vated by their determination to perform at an outstanding level and in a true spirit of innovation - will continue to help extend the BMW/uni00A0Group's competitive lead in the field of sustainable and digital mobility.\n\nMunich, March 2023\n\nOn behalf of the Supervisory Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Norbert Reithofer\n\nChairman of the Supervisory Board",

You can continue to expect this from your Com/uni00AD pany in the future. It is what makes us special. In the first part of my statement, I will explain our mission through five hypotheses.

        "page_content": "## First: You are investing in a company that is achieving profitable growth and/uni00A0gaining market share.\n\nThe BMW Group remains on track for success, as you would expect from your Company. This held true once again in 2022, when we were able to sell a total of around 2.4 million vehicles. Even though the numbers are down slightly on the previous year, this is still an/uni00A0excellent result. Despite the geopolitical challenges and supply chain bottlenecks, BMW/uni00A0and MINI's global market share remained stable at 3.4 %. Our Rolls/uni00ADRoyce and BMW/uni00A0Motorrad brands posted new all/uni00ADtime highs, with more than 6,000 luxury motor cars and almost 203,000 motorcycles and scooters delivered to customers. BMW Motorrad thus earned the number/uni00ADone spot in the global premium segment. To mark its 50th anniver/uni00AD sary, our BMW M GmbH also celebrated a record year - with the all/uni00ADelectric BMW i4 M50 as/uni00A0the best/uni00ADselling BMW M model.\n\nRamping up the all/uni00ADelectric vehicles in our product range is critical for us. We sold around 216,000 BEVs in 2022 - more than twice as many as in the previous year, as promised. This also signals our determination to the competition: BMW continues to lead the global premium segment! We have succeeded in lowering the WLTP CO2 emissions of our EU new vehicle fleet by 9.4 % compared to the previous year to 105.0 grams of CO2 per kilo/uni00AD metre and even outperformed the EU27+2 fleet target limit by 22.5 grams per kilometre.\n\nYour Company has a robust capital structure; it is profitable, even in a volatile environment, and therefore able to invest in its own future. Our Automotive EBIT margin for financial year 2022 was within our long/uni00ADterm target range of 8 - 10 %. Following our acquisition of a majority stake in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., the joint venture was fully consolidated into the Group Financial Statements for the first time last year - taking your Company's revenues and workforce to a whole new level. We now have around 150,000 employees, who collectively embody the BMW Spirit - with production at 31 locations on six continents, research and development in 17 countries, and 41 sales subsidiaries and financial services locations.\n\n## Second: You are investing in a company that is becoming even more resilient/uni00A0in the face of complex challenges.\n\nA year in task/uni00ADforce mode would be one way of describing much of 2022. Our environment was dominated by unexpected events and profound challenges - each with the potential to jeopardise our goals. As so often in our history, we trusted in our inner strength - learning from crises and emerging from them stronger than ever.\n\nToday, we can state with confidence that our Company weathered the global pandemic by relying on its sound judgement. As a result, we are now even better equipped to deal with possible future events. Maximum flexibility and a strong relationship with our suppliers have guided us through the recent supply difficulties around semiconductors and wiring har/uni00AD nesses. We are also using scenario planning to prepare for the difficult energy situation. We know we can handle complexity and are capable of pivoting quickly if the situation requires. The many different challenges we have faced have ultimately made your Company more resilient and strengthened our internal cohesion. It is nevertheless very important that we remain focused at all times on our course for the future.\n\nYour Company is characterised by its ability to combine short/uni00ADtime adjustments with long/uni00AD term consistency in our strategic direction and performance.\n\n'The many different challenges we/uni00A0have faced have ultimately made your Company more resilient. We are  learning from crises and are emerging from them/uni00A0stronger than ever.'",

        "page_content": "## Third: You are investing in a company that is boldly implementing breakthrough innovations and constantly reinventing itself.\n\nTime and again, the BMW Group has taken individual mobility to a new dimension with its ground/uni00ADbreaking innovations. It is also evolving from the ground up. In other words, trans/uni00AD formation is deeply rooted within our experience. Consider the three major tipping points in BMW  history: the shift from engine producer, which put the first BMW motorcycle on the roads exactly a hundred years ago, to development of our unmistakable, style/uni00ADdefining cars of the 1930s and, last but not least, the rediscovery of the sporty mid/uni00ADrange car in the early 60s. Each of these milestones moved your Company a decisive step forward - and defines and underpins the BMW Group to this day.\n\nIn 2025, we will be taking a further leap with the introduction of the NEUE KLASSE. This/uni00A0tipping point heralds another typical BMW shift - towards a new product offering, a/uni00A0new/uni00A0mindset, a new company. Our Vision Vehicles already provide a glimpse of this, as/uni00A0we/uni00A0make individual mobility electric, digital and circular. What this means for us is NEXT   LEVEL  MOBILITY.\n\nThe BMW i Vision Circular showcases the possibilities of the circular economy. At the beginning of January 2023, we revealed the BMW i Vision Dee at the CES in Las Vegas. This Vision Vehicle was a big hit with the global media and digital natives alike - and not just for its dazzling array of 32 exterior colours, courtesy of E/uni00ADInk technology. Real driving pleasure and augmented reality are seamlessly merged in a revolutionary full/uni00ADwindscreen head/uni00ADup display. Yet this new experience of mobility is not science fiction: a standard/uni00ADpro/uni00AD duction version of this technology will soon be available in the vehicles of the NEUE KLASSE as the 'BMW Panoramic Vision'. Stay tuned!\n\n## Fourth: You are investing in a company that takes the long view and always charts its own course.\n\nAs shareholders, you provide us with the strength we need to stay the long/uni00ADterm course. We are implementing this approach systematically, step by step, with our continuous corporate strategy development and long/uni00ADrange planning. The same applies to the mile/uni00AD stones we have announced on the road to climate neutrality for our vehicles, production and the supply chain. We have our progress measured and evaluated in a transparent manner and at regular intervals by independent bodies.\n\nWe do not chase after every new trend or let headwinds blow us off course. We can do this with a clear conscience - because our actions are based on facts, knowledge gains and scientific expertise. Our open approach to technology in the debate over the drivetrain of the future reflects this/uni00A0- because this is what delivers the fastest, most effective climate impact. At the same time, regions and individual markets will continue to develop at dif/uni00AD ferent rates for the  foreseeable future. And last but not least: Those who rely solely on a single drive technology risk falling into new dependencies - for example, around the raw materials needed for batteries. The new BMW 7 Series, including the all/uni00ADelectric BMW i7, and the new BMW X1, including the BMW iX1, are good examples of how we are realising customer interests through  technology. Both have won comparative tests; both have been widely praised by media and experts; and both are in high demand.\n\n## Fifth: You are investing in a company that acts independently and possesses a unique culture.\n\nWe consider our ability to operate independently and make decisions from a long/uni00ADterm perspective to be valuable  assets. In uncertain times, more than ever, this not only gives us additional stability; it even becomes a competitive advantage. Herbert Quandt laid the foundation for this at our Company. In keeping with his spirit, the Company and employee representatives work together to find solutions. Together, we f oster a culture of solidarity and mutual respect that is reflected not only in our interactions within the Company, but also in how we work with our partners and suppliers. This is all part of Herbert Quandt's legacy, to which his children and the Company are equally committed.\n\nDear Shareholders, on behalf of our entire Board of Management and our global team, I/uni00A0would like to say a sincere thank you for your support!\n\nOur business model is focused on individual mobility, which finds itself in the midst of a transformation and is, for that very reason, brimming with opportunity. The current decade will be decisive in this respect. Forecasts expect global new vehicle registrations to con/uni00AD tinue to increase up until 2030. Individual mobility remains a vibrant business segment not least because 'being mobile' is one of our basic human needs. So, stay at our side!",

In autumn 2022, all members of the Board of Management headed to Palm Springs, USA, to present the new BMW 7 Series, the BMW X7 and the BMW XM, which are now available, to the international media. These will be followed this spring by the update to our successful BMW X5 and BMW X6 models.\n\nHowever, more than anything, 2023 will be dominated for the BMW brand by the new BMW/uni00A05 Series. It will, of course, also be released onto the market as an all/uni00ADelectric variant: the BMW i5 - expanding our BEV offering in all the segments we serve.\n\n- 'The mobility of the future also needs at least one more leg to stand on. In addition to battery/uni00ADelectric drivetrains we see hydrogen/uni00ADelectric vehicles as a meaningful complement to e/uni00ADmobility.'\n\nMINI and Rolls/uni00ADRoyce are well on their way to becoming all/uni00ADelectric brands by the early 2030s. Already today, one out of five MINIs sold is an electric car. In April 2023, the release of exactly 999 MINI Cooper SE Convertibles is sure to excite our fans. This will be the world's first all/uni00ADelectric premium convertible in the compact/uni00ADcar segment. We have an entirely new MINI family in the starting blocks - which will be a major milestone for the brand on its journey into the future. At our highly profitable luxury brand, Rolls/uni00ADRoyce, the Spectre is also ushering in the electric age. Strong pre/uni00ADorders show how much customers appreciate this move.\n\nBMW Motorrad will/uni00A0celebrate its centenary this year with a raft of amazing new models. I can already reveal that this will also include several for those who prefer an all/uni00ADelectric ride.\n\n## Exponential growth in e/uni00ADmobility.\n\nWe are setting ourselves clear goals for exponential growth in our all/uni00ADelectric models: starting this year, the BEV share of total sales will be a KPI for the steering of our Company. All/uni00ADelectric vehicles are expected to account for 15 % of our global deliveries this year substantially more than in 2022 and the highest absolute increase we have targeted to date. We have already left our established competitors behind - not to mention many of the BEV/uni00ADonly manufacturers. We are confident that more than half the vehicles we sell world/uni00AD wide will be fully electric before 2030. This is not only because demand for our current models is highly dynamic, but also because our BEVs are winning a lot of new customers.\n\n## Hydrogen: Our world is full of diversity and individuality - why should mobility be any different?\n\nNo one can stand on one leg for an extended period of time - never mind trying to walk like that. We firmly believe that the mobility of the future also needs at least one more leg to stand on, in addition to battery/uni00ADelectric drivetrains. We see hydrogen/uni00ADelectric vehicles as a meaningful complement to e/uni00ADmobility - albeit with something of a time lag. We have long been paving the way for this: in March 2023, a small test series of our BMW iX5 Hydrogen will head to selected markets, including Korea, Japan, China, the US and  Europe. With just under 100 of these vehicles, we aim to demonstrate the maturity and everyday practicality of hydrogen fuel cell technology. The widespread interest in these vehicles gives us cause for/uni00A0optimism.",

        "page_content": "## Mega project NEUE KLASSE: The countdown has begun.\n\nOur preparations for the NEUE KLASSE are in full swing. In just a year and a half, pre/uni00AD series production will get underway at our new plant in Debrecen, Hungary - which, incidentally, will also be the world's most advanced car plant, using no fossil fuels at all. In 2026, pro/uni00AD duction of the NEUE KLASSE will also ramp up at our main plant in Munich. An area the size of nine football pitches will be remodelled there over the coming years. This will be followed in 2027 by our Mexican plant in San Luis Potos\u00ed. As you can see, we have tremen/uni00AD dous momentum driving us forwards. But the NEUE KLASSE will already be given a face this year - something you can look forward to at the IAA MOBILITY in Munich in September!\n\n## BMW iFACTORY and 'local for local'.\n\nWe are gearing our entire production network towards e/uni00ADmobility and the NEUE KLASSE, which will significantly speed up growth in our all/uni00ADelectric models yet again. By the end of/uni00A02022, 12 BEV engine variants came off production lines in eight different BEV models at our locations worldwide. Our plants are gradually becoming the BMW iFACTORY: Plant Debrecen, for instance, was planned entirely virtually.\n\nThe BMW Group is a global company - highly flexible, with a presence in all regions. How/uni00AD ever, the main regions of the world are increasingly setting their own priorities and devel/uni00AD oping in different ways when it comes to technology, legislation and customer preferences. In response to this situation, we are sharpening our global positioning by strengthening our local market presence. We call this 'local for local'. We are thus securing our BEV ramp/uni00AD up in individual regions to reduce one/uni00ADsided geopolitical dependencies. Today, our high/uni00AD voltage batteries for e/uni00ADmobility are being manufactured in Germany and at the Shenyang facility in China. Going forward, we will also produce them at separate assembly sites in Debrecen, San Luis Potos\u00ed in Mexico and in Spartanburg in the US.\n\nGlobal companies like the BMW Group depend on global free trade. We respond very precisely to customer demand, targeting opportunities that open up in individual markets. Through our entrepreneurial commitment and cooperation in the markets, we ourselves are constantly building bridges. At the same time, we are adapting to a world in which poli/uni00AD\n\ntics intervenes more and more in our business model - as exemplified by the Inflation Reduction Act 2022 in the US and the European Union's Euro 7 plans. We are strongly campaigning for a viable Euro 7, in terms of both timing and provisions for testing conditions.\n\n## Making 2023 our year of digital expertise.\n\nBehind a thoroughly digital product like BMW i Vision Dee stands a digital company. 2023 will be a key year for us, as we give our vehicles and our Company as a whole a real digital boost. Our 'Digital Process & Impact' initiative will massively speed up digitalisation of our internal processes and operations, exploiting digital potential in all areas. This will be accompanied by the launch of the Company's largest/uni00ADever training programme for all managers, non/uni00ADproduction functions and the Board of Management. AI, cybersecurity, the metaverse - our digitalisation push comes at exactly the right time. It also helps us to focus even more on customers in our sales activities. To this end, we will be using a direct sales model in Europe in the future, starting in 2024 with MINI. BMW will follow in 2026. We've received great support from our dealers, in part also because we have involved them cooperatively as partners. A win/uni00ADwin situation for everyone - our customers get the best mobility experience, our retailers get an attractive business model and we get direct cus/uni00AD tomer access.\n\n'We are gearing our entire  production network towards e/uni00ADmobility and the/uni00A0NEUE KLASSE. Our plants are becomming the BMW iFACTORY.'",

Con/uni00AD versely, societal trends and developments can influence many aspects of the /uni00A0Group's business activities.

        "page_content": "## Participation in public policy development and work in associations\n\nThe BMW Group maintains an active, open and transparent dia/uni00AD logue with decision makers and representatives of politics, trade unions, associations and non/uni00ADgovernmental organisations (NGOs), with a view to playing a constructive and transparent role in helping shape the general political framework to the extent that it concerns the Group's business activities. The BMW/uni00A0Group is a member of numerous associations in various countries. As a rule, membership and commitment are voluntary. In certain cases, however, participation may also be based on statutory requirements.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's involvement in associations ranges from board memberships in association bodies to active participation in working groups as well as simple observer status. Our goal is to coordinate our approach with the respective associations on positions regarding relevant strategic issues. If the BMW/uni00A0Group identifies discrepancies between association and Company positions, we work with the association concerned to bring our positions closer together. The BMW/uni00A0Group sees its role as shar/uni00AD ing its corporate opinions as part of the associations' policy /uni00AD forming process. In this way, we are able to participate in discus/uni00AD sions on key strategic issues such as climate protection, human rights, the circular economy, decarbonisation with a view to achieving the Paris climate targets, and transparent supply chain management.\n\nIn January 2021, Oliver Zipse, Chairman of the Board of Manage/uni00AD ment/uni00A0AG, assumed the presidency of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and held this position until 31/uni00A0December 2022. The president of the ACEA is elected for a term of one year and may be re/uni00ADelected once before the position is passed on to the CEO of another company.\n\nIn its /uni2197 Climate Commitment Report the BMW/uni00A0Group presents its stakeholders with a concise overview of its key climate policy positions and related activities.\n\n## Financial market player with sustainability credentials\n\nRegular, in/uni00ADdepth communication with capital market players has always been given a high priority within the BMW/uni00A0Group. Against the background of the Paris Climate Agreement, policymakers in Europe are also increasingly addressing the issues of climate protection and sustainability. For example, the EU Action Plan for Sustainable Finance aims to direct capital flows towards sus/uni00AD tainable economic activities. A key element of the EU Action Plan is the introduction of a standardised system to classify what is sustainable and what is not. /uni2197  EU Taxonomy\n\nIn 2022, the focus was on measuring the carbon footprint of the BMW/uni00A0Group's pension plan assets in the UK and Germany, and validating the data available for this purpose. The /uni2197/uni00A0TCFD/uni00A0Report was created for the UK BOPS Plan. The target to achieve carbon neutrality for the scheme's asset portfolio by 2050 remains unchanged.\n\nIn recent years, some of the traditional benchmarks used for in/uni00AD vesting have been replaced by ESG/uni00ADoptimised capital market indices. As a result, asset managers are now increasingly looking for ways to further reduce carbon emission exposures in their bond portfolios.\n\nThe volume of non/uni00ADliquid pension plan assets invested in our various impact funds continues to grow according to schedule, with several new subscriptions exercised in the form of fund/uni00AD based investments. The investments made to date in this area relate not only to climate protection, but also to other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set out by the UN. Investments that have a beneficial effect on the climate are at the forefront of the impact funds.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group will continue to interact closely with its stake/uni00AD holders and develop existing dialogue opportunities in 2023.\n\nWe continue to maintain a highly active dialogue with capital market players such as investors, investor initiatives, financial analysts and rating agencies. As in 2022, our activities will in/uni00AD clude direct dialogue as well as participation in ESG conferences.\n\nMoreover, plans are in place for the coming year to expand the scope of recording the carbon emissions associated with those investments, with the primary aim of reliably assessing and transparently documenting the compatibility of our investments with the climate goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement. To the extent possible, our aim is to take account of non/uni00ADliquid invest/uni00AD ments in the Group's reporting on sustainability, or at least for/uni00A0all such investments to be reviewed from a sustainability perspective.",

In 2022, the rating agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) both confirmed BMW/uni00A0AG's high credit ratings within a challenging market environment. Moody's long/uni00ADterm rating remains at 'A2 with stable outlook', while the short/uni00ADterm rating is unchanged at 'P/uni00AD1'. S&P's long/uni00ADterm rating remains at 'A with stable outlook', with a short/uni00ADterm rating of 'A/uni00AD1'.\n\nThese credit ratings are based on a variety of factors, including the popularity of the BMW Group's attractive product portfolio and its high number of new vehicle launches. Excellent price pen/uni00AD etration across all regions  as well as a continued strong oper/uni00AD ating performance, profitability and cash inflow were also taken into account. Other factors supporting the credit ratings are the BMW Group's solid capital structure, risk/uni00ADconscious financial profile and robust liquidity position. Moreover, the increasing proportion of Group sales of all/uni00ADelectric vehicles is seen as a\n\npositive factor. With this profile, the rating agencies view BMW/uni00A0AG as well prepared to master the numerous challenges arising in conjunction with the transformation of the automotive industry (e.g. future investments, research and development, dynamic competitive environment) and in terms of future macroeconom/uni00AD ic developments (e.g. commodity prices, supply bottlenecks, geopolitical upheavals, inflation).\n\nThese above/uni00ADaverage credit ratings are testimony to BMW/uni00A0AG's excellent creditworthiness. Accordingly, BMW/uni00A0AG enjoys good access to international capital markets and benefits from highly attractive refinancing conditions.\n\n| Company rating         | Moody's /uni200A1   | Standard  & Poor's /uni200A2   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Long/uni00ADterm debt  | A/two.tf            | A                              |\n| Short/uni00ADterm debt | P/uni00AD /one.tf   | A/uni00AD/one.tf               |\n| Outlook                | stable              | stable                         |\n\n- 1 Moody's scale for long/uni00ADterm ratings: Aaa to C.

To this end, we continuously monitor the business environment in our key regions, using available data to analyse the trends and developments that could affect our business in the future. Regular /uni2197 Dialogue with Stakeholders within the scope of the BMW/uni00A0Group XChange formats completes the picture from the analysis of external and environmental factors.\n\nThe most important megatrends with long/uni00ADterm implications for the BMW/uni00A0Group's business model are currently mobility patterns in society, climate change as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and resource consumption, electromo/uni00AD bility, digitalisation and connectivity - including automated and autonomous driving.",

On/uni00ADdemand mobility (ODM) services remain relevant, especially in urban areas, but are mainly used as a sup/uni00AD plementary option.\n\n## Climate change and CO2 reduction\n\nWe see the consequences of climate change as a major challenge for the future. As governments around the world work to trans/uni00AD pose the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement into national laws, investors are increasingly evaluating companies and their busi/uni00AD ness models according to ESG criteria. /uni2197/uni00A0 BMW/uni00A0Group and capital market Within the EU, the adopted /uni2197/uni00A0EU Taxonomy aims to classify a company's business activities according to sustainability criteria.\n\n## Electromobility and drive technologies\n\nIn the transport sector, a swift transition to electromobility is an important prerequisite on the road to climate neutrality. By 2030, a complete array electric vehicles in terms of both product diver/uni00AD sity and range will be offered. Growing demand is additionally strengthened by the benefits of lower running costs and frame/uni00AD work conditions such as government subsidies. /uni2197/uni00A0Electromobility\n\nThe modern vehicle is already one of the most complex digital items owned by consumers. The implementation of software in/uni00AD creasingly makes vehicles products which are expected to have corresponding digital functions. These are expected to provide reliable help and support in everyday life, offer additional options and fit seamlessly into a customer's personal environment. Accordingly, customer expectations are advancing worldwide and are an important factor in purchasing decisions.\n\n## /uni2197/uni00A0Innovation, Digitalisation and Customer Orientation\n\nBeyond vehicle digitalisation, connectivity offers further potential along the value chain. To this end, the BMW/uni00A0Group founded the virtual platform Catena/uni00ADX Automotive Network, together with other manufacturers, system suppliers and technology partners. Catena/uni00ADX connects global players to entire value chains with the aim of exchanging data securely on a standardised basis. /uni2197/uni00A0Pro/uni00AD duction and Supplier Network\n\n## Automated/autonomous driving\n\nAlongside digitalisation, development of automated/autonomous driving remains a key expectation for the future of mobility. Due to the importance of this topic for the automotive industry and the complexity of the technologies and required expertise, ex/uni00AD tensive funding is being channelled into development in this area worldwide.\n\nConcrete requirements and regulations for autonomous driving are likely to be in place in some individual countries and regions by 2025. The aim of all regulators is presumably to authorise au/uni00AD tonomous driving systems in the medium term. /uni2197/uni00A0Products\n\n## STRATEGY PROCESS\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group regards the strategy process as a continuous task. The Board of Management therefore regularly addresses strategic issues. The assumptions underpinning our strategy are/uni00A0regularly reviewed based on our environmental analysis. The BMW/uni00A0Group's corporate strategy, including its product strategy and its strategic goals, are the starting point for business depart/uni00AD ments to define concrete approaches and the corresponding measures. This process takes place via a closed/uni00ADloop planning and management system. The strategy is integrated into longer/uni00AD range corporate planning that is revised annually. Its implemen/uni00AD tation is monitored by a target system that is comprised of the aspects of finance, customers, processes, learning and develop/uni00AD ment. /uni2197/uni00A0 Performance  Indicators and Performance Management. The strategy process allows plans to be drawn up for different sce/uni00AD narios to account for increasingly volatile and challenging envi/uni00AD ronmental conditions, thereby ensuring flexibility and respon/uni00AD siveness.\n\n## Corporate strategy\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's strategy is oriented to its corporate purpose. It is the driving force, the guiding principle and the orientation for our employees, and our commitment to our active role in society: 'The BMW/uni00A0Group exists to move body, heart and mind.'\n\nWith this in mind, the BMW/uni00A0Group's corporate strategy, referred to as the 'BMW/uni00A0Group strategy', defines the strategic framework and lays the foundation for the Company to maintain a consistent and market/uni00ADoriented focus on profitability, growth and sus/uni00AD tainability, even in an increasingly dynamic environment. The BMW/uni00A0Group strategy outlines targets in four areas: position, direction, strategic approach and collaboration.",

It aims to find the right balance between business, the environment and society, and combines pleasure and responsibility without compromise. The BMW/uni00A0Group is committed to the Paris Climate Agreement and to providing a verifiable track record of continuous improve/uni00AD ment. To achieve this, the BMW/uni00A0Group promotes the reduction of CO2 emissions throughout the whole life cycle of its products as well as the principles of the circular economy - from the sup/uni00AD ply chain to production, the use phase and the recycling of its products. For this reason, the BMW/uni00A0Group has laid out measur/uni00AD able, science/uni00ADbased targets to be reached by 2030; these are firmly established across the Company (base year 2019). CO2 emissions are to be reduced as follows:\n\n- 1.  An average of 80 % carbon reduction at our own production sites and locations (Scope 1 and 2) per vehicle produced (/uni2197/uni00A0Reduce carbon emissions at the locations)\n- 2.  Carbon reduction during the vehicle's use phase (Scope 3 downstream) by an average of at least 50 % per kilometre driven. Increased efficiency in our electrified models and\n\nthe new generation of combustion engine technology will make this possible. An additional driving force for this is the dynamic growth in demand for our electrified vehicles /uni2197/uni00A0Electromobility , /uni2197/uni00A0Automotive segment\n\n- 3.  An average of at least 20 % * carbon reduction in the supply  chain (Scope 3 upstream) per vehicle produced /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nWe have joined the Science/uni00ADBased Targets Initiative (SBTi) for this purpose. This will enable us to guarantee transparency and comparability in the validation and measurement of our targets and, at the same time, ensure they are in line with the latest scientific findings. /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0Control parameters such as /uni2197/uni00A0carbon emissions over the entire prod/uni00AD uct life cycle are important /uni2197/uni00A0Performance indicators during the de/uni00AD velopment phase of our vehicle projects.

The ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement are\n\ndesigned to tackle climate change in the transport sector, requir/uni00AD ing a combination of modern drive technologies that are closely aligned with customer needs and different mobility requirements around the world. In addition to all/uni00ADelectric models, plug/uni00ADin hybrids and modern combustion engine technologies also make an im/uni00AD portant contribution to the reduction of global CO2 emissions. The BMW/uni00A0Group is also continuously forging ahead with its work with hydrogen. /uni2197/uni00A0Products\n\nESG criteria are built into individual market strategies across our global organisation.

It does so by understanding the needs of its current and future customers and exceeding their expectations. It combines groundbreaking technologies, emo/uni00AD tional products and individual customer care to create a unique overall experience. The topics of electrification, digitalisation and circularity are of particular importance.\n\nWe recognised the importance of electromobility early on and have been/uni00A0working resolutely to implement this transformation in the Company. The BMW/uni00A0Group invests in both the renovation of existing plants and the development of employee skills, with/uni00A0the view that continuous training guarantees jobs world/uni00AD wide. /uni2197/uni00A0Employees and Society The restructuring of our main plant in    Munich,  set to be completed by 2026, demonstrates how the BMW/uni00A0Group is successfully shaping the transformation of an entire plant - including engine production - during ongoing production, from combustion engine technology to 100 % electromobility. In  this context, the BMW/uni00A0Group is making considerable invest/uni00AD ments to also drive this continuous transformation in all aspects of sustainability (ESG criteria). /uni2197/uni00A0Production and Supplier Network , /uni2197/uni00A0Employees and Society\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is making customer experience the focus of all its marketing and sales activities. The aim is to offer the industry's best premium customer experience. In an increasingly digital environment with changing customer needs, the Company relies on a future/uni00ADoriented sales structure with a focus on the digitali/uni00AD sation of the customer interface and direct customer access. In this context, the My/uni00A0BMW/uni00A0App and MINI/uni00A0App play a significant role with almost ten million users at present. More than two million customers access the apps every day. Using their smart/uni00AD phones, they interact with their BMW or MINI vehicles, the BMW/uni00A0Group itself and the BMW and MINI dealerships and also receive personalised offers. The relationship with the customer thus becomes even closer.\n\nIn the future, direct sales with agents as sales representatives in Europe and China will become a further essential element of the realigned sales structure. MINI will be the first Group brand to implement the new sales model in Europe and China, and the BMW brand will follow suit in Europe in 2026. This is how the BMW/uni00A0Group is decisively driving forward with its online sale of vehicles.\n\nCustomers are free to choose whether they would like to order their vehicle from agents or online. They also have the option to seamlessly switch between both worlds. At the same time, we aim to achieve consistent prices across all sales channels, pro/uni00AD viding a beneficial transparency for our customers. The trading partners will be closely involved in the implementation. The new sales structure offers an attractive and sustainable business model for these partners, and they will continue to be the face for customers in the future, where they can focus on providing the best advice and support. In turn, the BMW/uni00A0Group is improving customer access through direct sales, a basic requirement when aiming to offer the best customer experience in the industry. In the\n\nFinancial Services segment, we are also continually expanding our services to include digital and modular services. The aim is for our products to be accessible to all customer groups across all channels within our strategic orientation in the  Financial Ser/uni00AD vices segment. /uni2197/uni00A0Financial Services segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Collaboration - How does the BMW/uni00A0Group achieve this?\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group constantly strives for the best results, support/uni00AD ing its employees with the discovery and development of their potential so they are able to remain productive. We support and challenge strong teams with complementary strengths who work together to achieve the best solutions in a complex environment. We see diversity as an important element of our competitiveness. /uni2197/uni00A0Employees and Society The diversity metric defines the share of women in management positions as a key performance indicator and a strategic target variable. The aim is to increase the share of women in management positions at the BMW/uni00A0Group to 22 % by 2025. /uni2197/uni00A0Performance Indicators and Performance Management\n\nBMW/uni00A0Group employees not only work closely together within the Company, but also with external partners. The stable relation/uni00AD ships that have grown in our partner networks over time are based on the same values as those at the BMW/uni00A0Group. They allow us to maximise our effectiveness and work together to lead the Company to success. This has proven effective in the crisis years, most recently in 2022: our /uni2197/uni00A0Supply Chains held up and our dealer network remained strong, despite challenging conditions including the shortage of semiconductor components, pandemic/uni00AD related lockdowns in China and additional supply bottlenecks resulting from the war in Ukraine.",

In 2021, the brand launched a performance automobile with an all/uni00ADelectric drive system, the BMW i4 M50 1 , followed by the BMW iX M60 1 in 2022.\n\nThe BMW i5 sedan and the long/uni00ADwheelbase version of the BMW/uni00A0iX1 for the Chinese market will be available for sale in 2023. Rolls/uni00ADRoyce, the world's leading brand in the luxury class, will launch its first all/uni00ADelectric vehicle, the Spectre/uni200A 1 . /uni2197/uni00A0 Automotive segment This means the BMW/uni00A0 Group will have at least one all/uni00ADelectric model in nearly all major model series on the roads in 2023. The share of electrified vehicles in total deliveries is expected to exceed 30 % by as early as 2025. Intelligent vehicle architecture and the highly flexible /uni2197/uni00A0 Production Network are the basis of this initiative.\n\nBMW Motorrad continued to pursue its electrification strategy with the successful launch of the BMW CE/uni00A004 electric scooter in March 2022. Furthermore, the all/uni00ADelectric BMW/uni00A0CE/uni00A002 concept vehicle provides an outlook on additional offerings in urban mobility. /uni2197/uni00A0Motorcycles segment\n\nIn addition to delivering product substance, we also offer cus/uni00AD tomers a 360\u02da approach with an appropriate charging ecosystem. Customers can charge their vehicles at home, at work and in public places, and can also use our BMW Charging and MINI Charging stations. /uni2197/uni00A0Electromobility\n\nBeginning in 2025, we will take the next step in our transforma/uni00AD tion process with the NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE, which is expected to set standards in electrification, digitalisation and circularity.\n\nThe NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE is distinguished by its new cluster architecture (NCAR), which is entirely focused on BEVs (battery electric vehi/uni00AD cles). The sixth generation of our electric drivetrain features a completely new high/uni00ADvoltage storage concept, optimised cell design and improved cell chemistry. These developments result in a roughly 30 % longer range, an up to 30 % shorter charging time, and about 50 % lower manufacturing costs. The new gen/uni00AD eration of drives will consist of highly scalable modules that can cover the entire range of our products. The BEV/uni00ADfocused vehicle architecture and the new generation of drives and batteries are/uni00A0 expected to provide significant gains in efficiency in the NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE.",

Additional volumes will be achieved by integrat/uni00AD ing NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE into the BMW/uni00A0Group plant in San Luis Potos\u00ed from 2027. All/uni00ADelectric vehicles are expected to make up more than half of the BMW/uni00A0Group's total deliveries by 2030. The Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brand is set to become fully electric by 2030, and the MINI brand will follow suit by 2031. /uni2197/uni00A0Electromobility\n\nAs part of the revolutionary user experience concept for the NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE, the BMW/uni00A0Panoramic Vision introduces a new generation of head/uni00ADup displays that provide customers with a projection of comprehensive, relevant information across the entire windscreen. This reinterpretation of driver orientation creates a new user interface and increases safety on the road by the 'eyes on the road and hands on the wheel' approach. The NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE also features a newly defined electric/electronic architecture for hardware and software and a new module system for automated driving. This is expected to establish the basis for generation of an increasing proportion of sales through individ/uni00AD ually configurable and bookable features over the vehicle's life cycle.\n\nAnother aim of the NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE is to achieve a new level of sustainability across the entire vehicle life cycle. To this end, the BMW/uni00A0Group focuses on the concept of circularity, using an in/uni00AD creasing proportion of secondary materials. /uni2197 Closing material cycles\n\n## PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND PERFOR/hyphen.case MANCE MANAGEMENT\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's strategic targets are derived from the find/uni00AD ings of the /uni2197/uni00A0Environmental Analysis and Megatrends in an ongoing /uni2197/uni00A0 Strategy Process and subsequently translated into a system for measuring performance. The resulting target system is therefore a key instrument for anchoring strategy throughout the Company. For corporate management purposes, the strategic targets are backed by effective performance indicators.\n\nLong/uni00ADrange corporate planning for the Company as a whole and its segments is geared towards the structure of the BMW/uni00A0Group target system. In this way, the targets set out in the planning are regularly compared with the BMW/uni00A0Group's strategic goals.\n\nOnce approved by the Board of Management and the Supervi/uni00AD sory Board, the target amounts decided upon within the strate/uni00AD gic target system become the basis of planning for the current reporting year and for the target agreements with BMW/uni00A0Group managers. /uni2197/uni00A0Remuneration Report The following summarises  the key performance indicators defined in DRS 20, which also form the basis for performance management in the BMW/uni00A0Group. /uni2197/uni00A0Performance Management\n\n## Group\n\n- - Profit before tax (EBT)\n- - Number of employees at the end of the year\n- - Share of women in management positions (in/uni00A0%)\n\n## Automotive segment\n\n- - Profit before financial result as a percentage of revenues (EBIT margin; in/uni00A0%)\n- - Return on capital employed (RoCE; in/uni00A0%)\n- - Deliveries (in units)\n- - Share of electrified vehicles in deliveries (in/uni00A0%; until 2022)\n- - Share of all/uni00ADelectric vehicles in deliveries (in/uni00A0%; from 2023,\n- see /uni2197/uni00A0Performance Management )\n- - CO2 emissions EU new vehicle fleet (in g CO2/km)\n- - CO2 emissions per vehicle produced (in tonnes)\n\n## Motorcycles segment\n\n- - Profit before financial result as a percentage of revenues (EBIT margin; in/uni00A0%)\n- - Return on capital employed (RoCE; in/uni00A0%)\n- - Deliveries (in units)\n\n## Financial Services segment\n\n- - Return on equity (RoE; in/uni00A0%)",

        "page_content": "## Performance management\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's performance management system follows a value/uni00ADbased approach that focuses on profitability, consistent company growth, value enhancement for capital providers, sus/uni00AD tainability, climate protection and job security. Capital is consid/uni00AD ered to be employed profitably when the amount of profit gener/uni00AD ated on a sustained basis exceeds the cost of equity and debt capital. This strategy also secures the desired degree of corpo/uni00AD rate autonomy in the long term.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0 Group's performance management system is based on a multilayered structure. Operational performance is man/uni00AD aged/uni00A0primarily at segment level. In order to influence long/uni00ADterm corporate performance, additional key performance figures are taken into account within the management system at Group level. In this context, the value added serves as one of several indicators to measure the contribution made to enterprise value during the financial year. This aspiration to add value is measured at both Group and segment level by means of the key perfor/uni00AD mance indicators. The link between value added and the relevant value drivers is presented in a simplified form below.\n\n## BMW Group - value drivers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing sustainability\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's long/uni00ADterm corporate strategy is determined by the Board of Management. Responsibility for implementing the Group's sustainability goals also lies with the full Board. Significant decisions are therefore also evaluated from the point of view of sustainability. This ensures that sustainability issues are systematically integrated in decision/uni00ADmaking processes and to compensation at top management levels.\n\nAs part of the procedures for managing sustainability on an in/uni00AD tegrated basis at corporate level, a Group target system has been created which has been implemented for each of the Board members' areas of responsibility. The BMW/uni00A0Group has set itself the target of decarbonising its vehicle fleet by an average of 40 % overall over the entire life cycle by 2030, compared to the base year 2019. In this context, specific targets have been set for the scope of the vehicle's use phase, production and supply chain ( /uni2197/uni00A0Position , /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions ). Based on these targets, specific carbon requirements for each vehicle project are derived, digital/uni00AD ly managed and monitored.\n\nAn integrated approach to target management ensures that the BMW/uni00A0Group's vehicle projects make a positive contribution towards achieving the sustainability targets that have been set. Furthermore, the BMW/uni00A0Group will increase targets for the use of secondary raw materials in the long term. Non/uni00ADfinancial perfor/uni00AD mance indicators such as carbon emissions and, in future, sec/uni00AD ondary raw materials quotas are therefore key performance indicators for all new vehicle projects. The overall result is a co/uni00AD hesive management model across all aspects of the business. This ensures that financial aspects are taken into consideration and the most effective measures are prioritised for implementa/uni00AD tion in all areas. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD13\n\n## Managing operational performance at segment level\n\nAt segment level, operational performance is managed using an aggregated approach based on returns on capital. Depending on the business model, the segments are measured on the basis of return on total capital or return on equity.",

        "page_content": "Return on capital employed (RoCE) is used for the Automotive and Motorcycles segments and return on equity (RoE) for the Financial Services segment. These indicators combine a wide range of relevant economic information, such as profitability (re/uni00AD turn on sales) and capital efficiency (capital turnover) to measure segment performance and the development of enterprise value.\n\n## Automotive segment\n\nThe most comprehensive key performance indicator used for the Automotive segment is RoCE, which provides information on the profitability of capital employed and business operations. Value driver analyses are used to interpret the causes of a change in RoCE and derive suitable measures to influence its development.\n\nThe capital employed items taken into account reflect the focus of operational segment management. Capital employed is cal/uni00AD culated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inven/uni00AD tories and trade receivables less trade payables. The amount of capital employed increased as compared to 2021 in light of the acquisition of further shares in BMW Brilliance and the resulting full consolidation of that entity in the BMW/uni00A0Group Financial State/uni00AD ments from 11/uni00A0February 2022. The increase arose primarily due to the takeover of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets as well as the capitalisation of reacquired rights in con/uni00AD junction with the purchase price allocation. The RoCE will be impacted temporarily by the higher capital base as well as the related amortisation expense expected to be recorded.\n\nThe strategic target for RoCE is 18 %.

These value drivers include deliveries and the operating return on sales (EBIT margin: segment profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues) as a key figure for profitability in the segment.\n\nFurthermore, the Automotive segment manages its compliance with fleet carbon emissions requirements in regulated markets. In this context, it also reports on the share of electrified vehicles in total deliveries. /uni2197/uni00A0Performance Indicators As compliance with reg/uni00AD ulatory requirements is a significant factor in the BMW/uni00A0Group's success, business decisions relating to vehicle projects also take targets for fleet carbon emissions into account. /uni2197/uni00A0 Managing sustainability Starting with the financial year 2023, the perfor/uni00AD mance indicator 'share of electrified vehicles in deliveries' will be replaced by the indicator 'share of fully electric vehicles in deliveries'.

Within the BMW Group, RoE is defined as segment profit before tax, divid/uni00AD ed by the average amount of equity capital in the Financial Ser/uni00AD vices segment. The target is a return on equity of at least 14 %.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| RoE Financial Services   | Profit before tax   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|\n|                          | Average equity      |\n\n## Strategic management at Group level\n\nStrategic management and the measurement of its financial impact are coordinated primarily at Group level in conjunction with the long/uni00ADterm corporate plan. Group profit/loss before tax provides a comprehensive measure of the Group's overall cor/uni00AD porate performance after consolidation effects and enables a transparent comparison over time. Other key performance in/uni00AD dicators at Group level are the size of the workforce at the year/uni00AD end as well as the share of women in management positions. By 2025, the BMW/uni00A0Group aims to increase the share of women in management positions to 22 %. /uni2197/uni00A0Strategy Process\n\nThe information provided by these key performance indicators at Group level is complemented by the two financial performance indicators of pre/uni00ADtax return on sales and value added. Value add/uni00AD ed, as a highly aggregated performance indicator, also provides an insight into capital efficiency and the (opportunity) cost of capital required to generate Group profit. A positive value added means that a return on investment above the cost of capital has been achieved.\n\n- earnings amount -\n- = cost of capital\n- = earnings amount (cost of capital rate x capital employed)\n\nValue added Group\n\n## Value added Group\n\n|                     | Earnings amount Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Earnings amount Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Earnings amount Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Earnings amount Cost of capital (equity + debt capital)   | Value added Group                               | Value added Group                          |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0million | 2022                                                      | 2021                                                      | 2022                                                      | 2021                                                      | 2022                                            | 2021                                       |\n| BMW Group           | /two.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/zero.tf       | /one.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf           | /one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/four.tf            | /eight.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/eight.tf              | /one.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/three.tf/six.tf | /seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/five.tf/one.tf |",

        "page_content": "Capital employed comprises the amount of Group equity and pension provisions as well as the financial liabilities of the Auto/uni00AD motive and Motorcycles segments employed on average at the end of each of the last five quarters. The earnings amount cor/uni00AD responds to Group profit/loss before tax, adjusted for interest expense incurred in conjunction with the pension provisions and on the financial liabilities of the Automotive and Motorcycles seg/uni00AD ments (profit/loss before interest expense and tax). The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return expected by capital provid/uni00AD ers in return for the capital employed. Since capital employed comprises an equity capital (e.g. share capital) and a debt capital element (e.g. bonds), the overall cost of capital is determined on the basis of the weighted average rates for equity and debt capital, measured using standard market procedures. The pre/uni00ADtax average weighted cost of capital for the BMW/uni00A0Group in 2022 was 12 %, unchanged from the previous year.\n\nIn order to determine the internal rate of return, risk/uni00ADadjusted cost of capital rates are based on the average of actual rates in recent years. In light of the long/uni00ADterm nature of product and in/uni00AD vestment decisions, the following internal rates of return are used in conjunction with segment management:\n\n| in/uni00A0%        | 2022                                                              | 2021                               |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Automotive         | /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf |                                    |\n| Motorcycles        | /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf |                                    |\n| Financial Services | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/four.tf                                | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/four.tf |\n\n## Value/uni00ADbased management for project decisions\n\nOperational business in the Automotive and Motorcycles seg/uni00AD ments is largely shaped by the life/uni00ADcycle/uni00ADdependent character of investment projects that have a substantial influence on future performance. Project/uni00ADrelated decisions are therefore a crucial element of financial management in the BMW/uni00A0Group. Project decisions are based on calculations derived from the expected cash flows of each individual project. Calculations are made for the complete term of a project, incorporating future years in which the project is expected to generate cash flows. Project decisions are taken on the basis of net present value and the internal rate of return calculated for the project. The net present value indi/uni00AD cates the extent to which the project will be able to generate future net cash inflows over and above the cost of capital. A project with a positive net present value enhances future value added and therefore results in an increase in enterprise value. The project's internal rate of return measures the average return on the capital employed in the project. For all project decisions, the project criteria and long/uni00ADterm impact on periodic results are measured and incorporated in the long/uni00ADterm Group plan. This approach enables an analysis of the impact of project decisions on periodic earnings and rates of return for each year during the term of the project.\n\n## Board of Management remuneration\n\nPerformance criteria for the variable remuneration paid to mem/uni00AD bers of the Board of Management are based on the key strategic targets and performance indicators.

With a growth rate of 1.8 %, Germany re/uni00AD corded the lowest increase in economic activity, mainly reflecting the impact of supply bottlenecks and higher energy prices, both of which hit the export/uni00ADoriented German economy harder than others. By contrast, the economies of France (+/uni200A2.6 %), Italy (+/uni200A3.9 %) and Spain (+/uni200A5.5 %) all managed to grow faster in 2022.\n\nGDP grew in the UK by 4.0 % in 2022. In the USA, the economy grew by 2.1 % in the reporting period, reflecting the impact of interest rate hikes already made or expected to be made by the US Reserve Bank (Fed) to combat the very high rate of inflation still prevailing in the USA. China's economy grew by 3.0 % in 2022 and therefore at a significantly slower pace than one year earlier, mainly due to the recurrent coronavirus/uni00ADinduced lock/uni00AD downs in a number of cities in light of the Chinese government's zero/uni00ADCovid strategy.The Japanese economy recovered only slight/uni00AD ly during the year under report. The growth rate of 1.1 % was due to weaker demand, particularly from private households.\n\n## Currency markets and international interest rate environment\n\nSupply chain bottlenecks and significantly higher energy prices contributed to rising inflation in the world's major economies in 2022.

In response to high inflation, the Bank of England (BoE) also raised its benchmark interest rate significantly.\n\nHigh inflation levels worldwide in combination with a weakening global economy in 2022 caused the value of the Chinese  renminbi to fall continually, resulting in an average exchange rate for the year of 7.1 renminbi to the euro.\n\nThe Japanese/uni00A0yen fluctuated between 145 and 129/uni00A0yen to the euro during 2022. Based on an average exchange rate of 138/uni00A0yen, the Japanese currency fell in value against the euro compared to the previous year.\n\nThe currencies of major emerging markets appreciated during 2022, in some cases significantly, due to the sharp rise in raw materials prices.

Further information on the effect of the full consolidation is pro/uni00AD vided in /uni2197/uni00A0note 3 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nSupply bottlenecks for semiconductor components, the limited availability of wiring harnesses due to the war in Ukraine and pandemic/uni00ADrelated lockdowns in China led collectively to world/uni00AD wide production cutbacks during the financial year under report. Whereas the supply situation for wiring harnesses eased during the second quarter 2022, the limited availability of semiconduc/uni00AD tor components and numerous lockdowns in China in particular continued to cause problems for global supply chains and hence production. Towards the end of the third quarter, the supply situ/uni00AD ation for semiconductor components began to ease perceptibly, only for renewed pandemic/uni00ADrelated lockdowns to take their toll in the form of production cutbacks and dealership closures in China during the fourth quarter. For the financial year as a whole, sales volumes were therefore slightly down on the previous year due to production/uni00ADrelated factors.\n\nNevertheless, the Group revenues were significantly higher than one year earlier (2022: \u20ac/uni00A0142,610/uni00A0million; 2021: \u20ac/uni00A0111,239/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion/+ 28.2 %), mainly due to the revenue impact of fully consol/uni00AD idating BMW/uni00A0Brilliance. Favourable pricing and product mix ef/uni00AD fects as well as the higher volume of business with spare parts and accessories also contributed to revenue growth, despite the decline in sales volumes. The favourable situation on pre/uni00ADowned vehicle markets, particularly in the USA and Germany, enabled the BMW Group to achieve higher selling prices on lease returns during the financial year under report. Exchange rate factors also had a positive effect on revenues.\n\nAs with revenues, the fact that BMW/uni00A0Brilliance is now fully con/uni00AD solidated contributed significantly to the increase in cost of sales. The impact of a number of first/uni00ADtime consolidation/uni00ADrelated ex/uni00AD penses such as depreciation and amortisation arising on the purchase price allocation (\u20ac/uni00A01.8/uni00A0billion) and the elimination of intragroup profits (\u20ac/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion) also drove up segment cost of sales. Increasing costs for materials and logistics as well as higher warranty expenses in 2022 had a corresponding negative impact on the cost of sales, particularly due to the limited avail/uni00AD ability of semiconductors, supply chain disruptions and higher\n\nprices for raw materials and energy. Expenses arising on the sale of lease returns, a rise in financing costs due to higher interest rates, higher expenses for loan provisions and a larger share of electrified vehicles in total deliveries were further factors that drove up cost of sales. However, with residual values remaining high on pre/uni00ADowned automobile markets, positive outcomes aris/uni00AD ing on the resale of lease returns had a dampening effect on cost of sales. The ongoing transformation towards electric mobility and the associated short/uni00AD and medium/uni00ADterm impact on the prod/uni00AD uct portfolio require a regular review of the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment subject to systematic depre/uni00AD ciation. Some useful lives were revised during the financial year/uni00A0and extended accordingly, giving rise to a positive effect of \u20ac/uni00A0524/uni00A0million, which also contributed to a reduction in the cost of sales. Further information is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note 23 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nIn the previous financial year, the changeover effects resulting from the modernisation of the pension plan model in Germany had a total positive impact of \u20ac 562 million on Group cost of sales as well as selling and administrative expenses. Depreciation and amortisation on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets recorded in cost of sales as well as in selling and admin/uni00AD istrative expenses totalled \u20ac/uni00A08,566/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A06,495/uni00A0million).\n\nThe BMW Group's research and development expenditure was moderately higher than one year earlier. By contrast, the research and development ratio went down year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear due to the high/uni00AD er level of revenues reported. A substantial portion of research and development expenditure relates to new models, the /uni2197/uni00A0NEUE/uni00A0KLASSE , and within this context, the sixth generation of electric drives, the digitalisation of the vehicle fleet, and auto/uni00AD mated   driving.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses de/uni00AD creased significantly year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear, primarily due to the partial reversal of the provision relating to the antitrust proceedings conducted by the EU Commission in the second quarter 2021.",

The result from at/uni00ADequity accounted invest/uni00AD ments came in at a net negative amount of \u20ac/uni00A0100/uni00A0million, and therefore significantly lower than one year earlier (2021: net positive amount of \u20ac/uni00A01,520/uni00A0million), reflecting the fact that the Group's at/uni00ADequity share of earnings in the BMW/uni00A0Brilliance joint venture in China was only included in this line item until 10 Feb/uni00AD ruary 2022.\n\nThe favourable fair value development of interest rate hedges contributed to the increase in other financial result in 2022, thanks in particular to significant upturns in yield curves, mainly in the USA, the UK and the eurozone. The net interest result was impacted by interest income earned on bank balances and income in connection with the measurement of provisions due to changes in interest rates.\n\nAs forecast most recently in the quarterly statement to 30/uni00A0Sep/uni00AD tember 2022, Group profit before tax amounting to \u20ac/uni00A023,509/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion  was  significantly  higher  than  one  year  earlier  (2021: \u20ac/uni00A016,060/uni00A0million).\n\nGroup income tax expense for the year rose to \u20ac/uni00A04,927/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A03,597/uni00A0million; + 37.0 %), mainly due to the tax expense arising at the level of BMW Brilliance being reported in this line item with effect from the date of full consolidation. The effective tax rate for the 12/uni00ADmonth period was 21.0 % (2021: 22.4 %). The/uni00A0tax/uni00ADneutral gain recognised in conjunction with the remeas/uni00AD urement of the BMW Group's previous at/uni00ADequity interest in BMW/uni00A0 Brilliance reduced the effective tax rate.\n\nThe size of the workforce increased significantly to 149,475 em/uni00AD ployees compared to one year earlier and was therefore in line with   expectations (2021: 118,909 employees; + 25.7 %).\n\n## BMW/uni00A0Group research and development expenses\n\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0million                  | 2022                                        | 2021                                       |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Research and development expenditure | /seven.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf | /six.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf |\n| Capitalised development costs        | - /two.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/one.tf/nine.tf  | - /two.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/six.tf  |\n| Amortisation                         | /two.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/six.tf/five.tf      | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/five.tf  |\n| Research and development expenses    | /six.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/two.tf/four.tf      | /six.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf    |\n\n## BMW/uni00A0Group performance indicators relating to research and development expenses\n\n| in %                                                 | 2022                                 | 2021                               | Change   in % points       |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Research and development expenditure ratio /uni200A1 | /five.tf/period.tf/zero.tf           | /six.tf/period.tf/two.tf           | - /one.tf/period.tf/two.tf |\n| Capitalisation rate /uni200A2                        | /three.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/three.tf | /three.tf/six.tf/period.tf/five.tf | /two.tf/period.tf/eight.tf |\n\n- 1 Research and development expenditure as a percentage of Group revenues.\n- 2 Capitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n- 3 Further information is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note 32 to the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Share buyback programme\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of BMW/uni00A0AG on 11 May 2022, the shareholders authorised the Board of Management to acquire treasury shares via the stock exchange, up to a maximum of 10 % of the share capital in place at the date of the resolution and to withdraw those shares from circulation without any further action required by the Annual General Meeting. The buyback authori/uni00AD sation remains valid until 10 May 2027. BMW/uni00A0AG resolved to in/uni00AD itiate a share buyback programme on the basis of this authori/uni00AD sation.

The programme was launched on 1 July 2022 and is scheduled to be completed by no later than 31 December 2023. During the period from 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022, BMW/uni00A0AG repurchased 15,312,007 shares of common stock for \u20ac/uni00A01,172 million and 1,448,950 shares of pre/uni00AD ferred stock for \u20ac/uni00A0106 million, all of which are now reported as treasury shares. At 31 December 2022, BMW/uni00A0AG therefore held a total of 16,760,957 treasury shares, corresponding to a nominal amount of \u20ac 16,760,957 or 2.53 % of the Company's share capital./uni200A/uni200A",

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BMW GROUP\n\nThe consolidated cash flow statements for the Group and the Automotive and Financial Services segments show the sources and applications of cash flows for the financial years 2022 and 2021, classified according to operating, investing and financing activities. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements correspond to the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet.\n\nCash flows from operating activities are determined indirectly, starting with Group/segment profit before tax. By contrast, cash flows from investing and financing activities are based on actual payments and receipts.\n\nThe decrease in new credit financing and leasing business with retail customers resulted in lower levels of leased products and receivables from sales financing and hence to a positive impact on cash inflows from operating activities. The decrease in retail customer financing was partially offset by an increase in dealer/uni00AD ship financing, mainly due to improved vehicle availability towards the end of the year under report and higher selling prices. The increase in trade receivables caused working capital to rise sig/uni00AD nificantly, whereby the impact was partially offset by the higher level of trade payables. The year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear change in provisions was mainly due to the partial reversal of the provision relating to the EU antitrust proceedings in the previous year.\n\nHigher investments in property, plant and equipment and intan/uni00AD gible assets, attributable in particular to the launch of new vehicle models as well as the full consolidation of BMW/uni00A0Brilliance, result/uni00AD ed in higher cash outflows from investing activities year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear. This was offset by a positive effect of \u20ac/uni00A03,587/uni00A0million arising on the first/uni00ADtime consolidation of BMW/uni00A0Brilliance (see /uni2197 note 3 /uni00A0to the Group Financial Statements). In addition, the lower net amount reported for cash flows from investing activities was influenced by cash inflows arising on the sale of marketable securities.\n\nThe increase in the net outflow amount reported for cash flows from financing activities was mainly due to higher repayments of financial liabilities. Cash flows from financing activities were also impacted by higher dividend payments (2022: \u20ac/uni00A05,282 mil/uni00AD lion, 2021: \u20ac/uni00A01,277 million) as well as payments in conjunction with the share buyback programme at the level of BMW/uni00A0AG amounting to \u20ac/uni00A01,278 million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A00 million).\n\n## BMW Group cash flows\n\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0million                                               | 2022                                                 | 2021                                            | Change                                           |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities *         | /two.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/two.tf/three.tf    | /one.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/one.tf/four.tf | /seven.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf        |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing /uni200Aactivities * | - /four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf/two.tf         | - /six.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf      | /one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/two.tf/eight.tf          |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from financing activities           | - /one.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf/four.tf | - /six.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/five.tf    | - /one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/nine.tf |\n| Effects of exchange rate and changes in composition of segment    | /nine.tf/four.tf                                     | - /three.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf                    | /four.tf/zero.tf/one.tf                          |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents                               | /eight.tf/six.tf/one.tf                              | /two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/seven.tf/two.tf        | - /one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/one.tf/one.tf          |\n\n- * Previous year's figure adjusted.\n\nFree cash flow for the Automotive segment was as follows:\n\n## Free cash flow Automotive segment\n\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0million                                                         | 2022                                              | 2021                                              | Change                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities                     | /one.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf/two.tf | /one.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/eight.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing activities                     | - /three.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf      | - /six.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf        | /three.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/nine.tf  |\n| Adjustment for net investment in marketable securities and investment funds | - /five.tf/three.tf/two.tf                        | - /two.tf/one.tf                                  | - /five.tf/one.tf/one.tf                   |\n| Free cash flow Automotive segment                                           | /one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/one.tf   | /six.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/five.tf/four.tf         | /four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/one.tf/seven.tf |",

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\nThe Automotive segment's free cash flow includes operating cash flows from the fully consolidated entity BMW/uni00A0Brilliance with effect from 11 February 2022. The segment's free cash flow came in /uni00A0at a record level of \u20ac/uni00A011,071 /uni00A0million/uni00A0 at 31 December 2022. The main reason for the year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear increase was the reduction in cash flows from investing activities, whereby higher cash outflows for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were more than offset by the cash acquired of \u20ac/uni00A05,011/uni00A0million resulting from the full consolidation of BMW/uni00A0Brilliance (see /uni2197/uni00A0note 3 to the Group Financial Statements).\n\nThe change in working capital was affected positively by the decrease in inventories and negatively by the increase in trade receivables. At the same time, trade payables increased by a less pronounced amount in 2022 as a consequence of production cutbacks caused by supply bottlenecks for semiconductor com/uni00AD ponents, the limited availability of wiring harnesses and pan/uni00AD demic/uni00ADrelated lockdowns, resulting in a lower offsetting impact. Liabilities for advance payments received and dealership bonus liabilities were also lower than at the end of the previous year, influenced in part by pandemic/uni00ADrelated dealership closures in China during the fourth quarter 2022. The net cash inflow from operating activities was also negatively impacted by the signifi/uni00AD cantly higher level of income taxes paid, reflecting higher earn/uni00AD ings and the fact that BMW/uni00A0Brilliance is now fully consolidated.\n\nThe decrease in the net cash outflow from investing activities was mainly attributable to the changes described in the Group Cash Flow Statement.\n\nIn the Automotive segment, net financial assets comprised the following:\n\n## Net financial assets Automotive segment\n\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0million                            | 31.12.2022                                           | 31.12.2021                                          | Change                                   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                      | /one.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf     | /one.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf     | /one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Marketable securities and investment funds     | /three.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/one.tf           | /three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/six.tf/seven.tf         | - /seven.tf/three.tf/six.tf              |\n| Intercompany net financial receivables         | /one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf      | /nine.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/one.tf/one.tf              | /two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/six.tf |\n| Financial assets                               | /two.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/three.tf/seven.tf | /two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/five.tf/zero.tf |\n| Less: external financial liabilities /uni200A1 | - /two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/four.tf         | - /two.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/two.tf/five.tf           | - /two.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf                |\n| Net financial assets Automotive segment        | /two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/zero.tf/three.tf     | /two.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/six.tf/two.tf      | /two.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/one.tf   |\n\n1 Excluding derivative financial instruments.\n\nCash and cash equivalents held by the Financial Services seg/uni00AD ment changed as follows:\n\n## Cash flows Financial Services segment\n\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0million                                               | 2022                                       | 2021                                       | Change                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from operating activities /uni200A2 | /nine.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/four.tf/five.tf   | /three.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf | /five.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/five.tf |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from investing activities /uni200A2 | - /five.tf/zero.tf                         | /six.tf/three.tf                           | - /one.tf/one.tf/three.tf                   |\n| Cash inflow (+) / outflow (-) from financing activities           | - /nine.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/four.tf/two.tf | - /two.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/two.tf/nine.tf   | - /six.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/one.tf/three.tf  |\n| Effects of exchange rate and changes in composition of segment    | /six.tf                                    | - /nine.tf/six.tf                          | /one.tf/zero.tf/two.tf                      |\n| Change in cash and cash equivalents                               | /five.tf/nine.tf                           | /six.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                   | - /five.tf/four.tf/nine.tf                  |\n\n2 Previous year's figure adjusted.\n\nThe higher net cash inflow from operating activities mainly re/uni00AD flected a decrease in leased products during the year under report.

The funds raised are used almost exclusively to refinance the BMW Group's Financial Services business. The overall objective of Group fi/uni00AD nancing is to ensure the solvency of the BMW/uni00A0Group at all times, focusing on three areas:\n\n- 1. The ability to act through permanent access to strategically important capital markets\n- 2. Autonomy through the diversification of refinancing instru/uni00AD ments and investors\n- 3. A focus on value through the optimisation of financing costs\n\nFinancing measures undertaken at corporate level ensure access to liquidity for the Group's operating subsidiaries at standard market conditions and consistent credit terms. Funds are ac/uni00AD quired in line with a target liability structure, comprising a balanced mix of financing instruments. The use of longer/uni00ADterm instruments to refinance the Group's Financial Services business and the maintenance of a sufficiently high liquidity reserve serves to rule out any imminent liquidity risk for the portfolio. This conservative financial approach also has a favourable effect on the Group's rating. Further information is provided in the section Liquidity risks within the chapter /uni2197 Risks and opportunities .\n\nFocused capital market management, good ratings and the high level of acceptance enjoyed by the BMW/uni00A0Group on those markets enabled it to refinance itself on the world's debt capital markets at favourable conditions during the 12/uni00ADmonth period under report. In addition to bonds, the BMW Group also issued commercial paper in 2022. Moreover, retail customer and dealership financing receivables as well as rights and obligations from leasing con/uni00AD tracts were securitised in the form of asset/uni00ADbacked securities (ABS) financing arrangements. Specific banking instruments, such as the customer deposits used by the Group's own banks in Germany and the USA, were also deployed for refinancing purposes. In addition, loans were taken from international banks.\n\nIn 2022, the BMW/uni00A0Group issued bonds totalling approximately \u20ac/uni00A04.4/uni00A0billion. The Group refinanced itself by means of 144A trans/uni00AD actions with a total volume of 2.0/uni00A0billion/uni00A0US dollars on the US capital market and by means of so/uni00ADcalled Panda bonds with a volume of 4.0/uni00A0billion Chinese renminbi on the Chinese capital market. Activities on international capital markets were rounded off by a euro benchmark bond amounting to \u20ac/uni00A02.0/uni00A0billion. ABS transactions with a total financing volume equivalent to \u20ac/uni00A011.1/uni00A0bil/uni00AD lion were executed in 2022, including both new and rolled/uni00ADover ABS transactions. During the year under report, the BMW/uni00A0Group was party to ABS transactions in the following markets: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Japan, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, the USA and the UK.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of amounts utilised at 31 December 2022 in connection with the BMW/uni00A0Group's money and capital market programmes:\n\n| Programmes                    | Programme  volume                  | Amount  utilised /uni200A*         |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| in \u20ac/uni00A0billion           |                                    |                                    |\n| Euro medium/uni00ADterm notes | /five.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/four.tf/period.tf/three.tf |\n| Commercial paper              | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/period.tf/seven.tf         |\n\n- * Measured at the year/uni00ADend exchange rate.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group continued to deploy robust liquidity/uni00ADrelated measures throughout 2022 to ensure its ability to act flexibly and independently at all times. At 31 December 2022, liquidity on hand totalled \u20ac/uni00A020.3/uni00A0billion and was therefore similar to the pre/uni00AD vious year's corresponding figure of \u20ac/uni00A020.2/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group also has access to a syndicated credit line, which was renegotiated in July 2017. The term of the syndicated credit line amounting to \u20ac 8/uni00A0billion ends in July 2024 and is being made available by a consortium of 44 international banks.\n\nThe credit line was not being utilised at 31 December 2022.

Higher investments for the fifth generation of electric drive sys/uni00AD tems and for new vehicle projects such as the new BMW/uni00A07 Series and the BMW/uni00A0X1 also contributed to the increase. The ongoing transformation towards electric mobility and the associated short/uni00AD and medium/uni00ADterm impact on the product portfolio require a regular review of the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment subject to systematic depreciation. Some useful lives were revised during the financial year and extended accordingly, giving rise to a positive effect of \u20ac 524 million.\n\nBased on constant currencies, leased products were moderate/uni00AD ly down over the 12/uni00ADmonth period. The size of the contract port/uni00AD folio under management also decreased compared with one year earlier. This development arose against the backdrop of the low/uni00AD er level of new business, mainly in the USA, offset to some extent by a higher average financing volume per vehicle in light of favourable product mix and price penetration effects.",

In addition, as BMW Group con/uni00AD tinues to enhance its policies and procedures regarding retail vehicle delivery data, it may not always be practicable for BMW Group to adjust prior/uni00ADperiod data (and any such adjustments would be of a de minimis nature without any material impact on the comparability of periods). Examples of the foregoing include:\n\n- - The vast majority of deliveries of vehicles are carried out by independent dealerships or other third parties, and BMW Group is reliant on such third parties to correctly report rele/uni00AD vant data to BMW Group.\n- - The definition of deliveries includes vehicles delivered in the United States and Canada if the relevant dealers designate such vehicles as service loaner vehicles or demonstrator vehicles.\n\nRetail vehicle deliveries during a given reporting period do not correlate directly to the revenue that BMW Group recognises in respect of such reporting period.\n\n## AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENT\n\n## Strong market presence despite challenging environment\n\nOn the back of its strong market presence, business developed positively overall for the BMW Group in the financial year 2022. The Group's attractive range of products helped generate brisk customer demand, which was reflected in high order book levels throughout the year. However, due to the prevailing tight supply situation for semiconductor components, the high demand for BMW, MINI and Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brand automobiles could not be fully met in 2022. The situation was further exacerbated by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, particularly in the form of local lock/uni00AD downs in China. Despite these various global challenges, the BMW Group delivered a total of 2,399,632/uni200A 2 vehicles to customers in 2022. In line with expectations, deliveries were therefore slightly down on the previous year (2021: 2,521,514/uni200A 2 /uni00A0units; -/uni200A4.8 %).\n\nDuring the 12/uni00ADmonth period under report, a total of 2,100,689 BMW/uni00A0brand (2021: 2,213,790/uni200A 2 /uni00A0 units; -/uni200A5.1 %) and 292,922 MINI brand vehicles (2021: 302,138/uni00A0units; -/uni200A3.1 %) were delivered. The ultra/uni00ADluxury Rolls/uni00ADRoyce marque achieved a new sales volume record in 2022, with deliveries climbing to 6,021/uni00A0units (2021: 5,586/uni00A0units; +/uni200A7.8 %).\n\n## Deliveries of all/uni00ADelectric vehicles more than doubled\n\nThe systematic electrification of its products, with a wide range of attractive models, is proving to be a key success factor for the BMW/uni00A0Group. High demand for BMW and MINI brand all/uni00ADelectric vehicles gave rise to dynamic sales growth in this area in 2022. Overall, the BMW Group delivered a total of 215,752 3 all/uni00ADelectric vehicles to customers, more than doubling the number achieved one year earlier (2021: 103,854/uni200A 3 /uni00A0units; +/uni200A107.7 %). The innovative BMW iX/uni200A 4 and BMW i4/uni200A 4 in particular played a major role in this development, with both models generating an extremely positive response. The BMW iX3 4 and the MINI Cooper SE 4 also contin/uni00AD ued to meet with an unchanged high level of demand in their various markets. Towards the end of 2022, the BMW/uni00A0Group's ever/uni00ADgrowing product range was added to with the launch of two\n\nfurther all/uni00ADelectric models, the BMW i7 /uni200A4 luxury sedan and the all/uni00ADelectric BMW iX1/uni200A 4 . Sales of battery electric (BEV) and plug/uni00ADin electric (PHEV) vehicles in 2022 totalled 433,792/uni200A 3 units (2021: 328,314/uni200A 3 /uni00A0units; +/uni200A32.1 %). The share of electrified automobiles in total deliveries during the 12/uni00ADmonth period under report rose to 18.1 % (2021: 13.0 %; +/uni200A39.2 %). At the same time, the higher share enabled further progress to be made in reducing fleet emis/uni00AD sions. /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions\n\n## BMW Group deliveries of electrified models\n\n| in units                                                    | 2022                                                       | 2021                                        | Change  in %   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| /two.tf/one.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/two.tf     | /one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/five.tf/four.tf | /one.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/seven.tf | BEV            |\n| /one.tf/seven.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf   | /six.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/three.tf          | /one.tf/four.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/three.tf  | BMW            |\n| /four.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/four.tf         | /three.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/five.tf/one.tf         | /two.tf/five.tf/period.tf/five.tf           | MINI           |\n| /two.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/four.tf/zero.tf    | /two.tf/two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/six.tf/zero.tf     | - /two.tf/period.tf/nine.tf                 | PHEV           |\n| /two.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/five.tf    | /two.tf/zero.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/six.tf/nine.tf     | - /two.tf/period.tf/five.tf                 | BMW            |\n| /one.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf/five.tf           | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/nine.tf/one.tf          | - /seven.tf/period.tf/zero.tf               | MINI           |\n| /four.tf/three.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf/two.tf | /three.tf/two.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/one.tf/four.tf | /three.tf/two.tf/period.tf/one.tf           | Total 3        |\n\n- 2 Includes BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. for the full year, i.e. including the period prior to that entity's full consolidation in the BMW Group Financial Statements (1 January to 10 February 2022: 96,133 units, 2021: 651,236 units).\n\n- 4 /uni2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.",

This was followed in the spring of 2022 by new versions of the BMW M8 and the BMW M8 Competition, and by the launch of the first BMW M3 Touring in the summer. The BMW XM/uni200A 2 , which was unveiled in autumn, gave customers a pre/uni00AD view of likely developments in the coming year. The first BMW M plug/uni00ADin hybrid powered by a high/uni00ADperformance engine will go on sale worldwide in the course of 2023.",

A similarly successful performance was achieved with the Bespoke programme which enables buyers to customise their Rolls/uni00ADRoyce according to their individual wishes.\n\n*\n\n## Deliveries of Rolls/uni00ADRoyce vehicles by model variant\n\n| in units                 | 2022                                     | 2021                                      | Change  in %                        |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Phantom                  | /four.tf/one.tf/eight.tf                 | /four.tf/two.tf/seven.tf                  | - /two.tf/period.tf/one.tf          |\n| Ghost                    | /two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/one.tf/five.tf  | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf  | /five.tf/period.tf/six.tf           |\n| Wraith/Dawn              | /three.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                | /eight.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                 | - /six.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/four.tf |\n| Cullinan                 | /three.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/six.tf/zero.tf | /two.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/two.tf/two.tf    | /three.tf/four.tf/period.tf/six.tf  |\n| Rolls/uni00ADRoyce total | /six.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/one.tf   | /five.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/eight.tf/six.tf | /seven.tf/period.tf/eight.tf        |\n\nWith the presentation of the Rolls/uni00ADRoyce Spectre * in 2022, the marque reached an important milestone on the road to electrify/uni00AD ing its product range.

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## Results of operations of the Automotive segment\n\nAutomotive segment revenues amounted to \u20ac/uni00A0123,602/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A095,476/uni00A0million; +/uni200A29.5 %, currency/uni00ADadjusted: +/uni200A24.1 %) and were therefore significantly higher than one year earlier. The main reason for the revenue growth reported was the full con/uni00AD solidation of BMW Brilliance (see /uni2197/uni00A0note 3 to the Group Financial Statements). As already described in the section on the Group's earnings performance, automobile sales were in fact down on the previous year due to production factors, the impact of which was offset by the renewed increased volume of high/uni00ADrevenue vehicles sold, favourable price penetration effects and the con/uni00AD tinuing positive trend on pre/uni00ADowned vehicle markets, the latter being reflected in improved residual values. Growth in spare parts and accessories business as well as favourable currency effects also contributed to the rise in revenues.\n\nSegment cost of sales amounted to \u20ac/uni00A0104,324/uni00A0million and was therefore  significantly  higher  than  one  year  earlier  (2021: \u20ac/uni00A078,637/uni00A0million; +/uni200A32.7 %). As with revenues, the fact that BMW Brilliance is now fully consolidated contributed significantly to the increase in cost of sales. The impact of a number of first/uni00ADtime consolidation/uni00ADrelated expenses such as depreciation and amor/uni00AD tisation arising on the purchase price allocation (\u20ac/uni00A01.8/uni00A0billion) and the elimination of intragroup profits (\u20ac/uni00A01.3/uni00A0billion) also drove up segment cost of sales. Significantly rising costs for materials and logistics also had a negative impact on the segment's cost of sales during the financial year, particularly due to the limited availability of semiconductors, supply chain disruptions and higher prices for raw materials and energy. A larger proportion of electrified vehicles and higher warranty expenses due to the exhaust gas recirculation cooler, BMW Brilliance's first/uni00ADtime con/uni00AD solidation, and climbing inflation also had the effect of increasing segment cost of sales.\n\nIn the previous financial year, the changeover effects arising from the modernisation of the pension model in Germany had a total positive impact of \u20ac 542 million on Automotive segment cost of\n\nsales as well as selling and administrative expenses. Cost of sales benefited from the extension of useful lives as described above in the amount of \u20ac/uni00A0524/uni00A0million.\n\nThe net amount of other operating income and expenses de/uni00AD creased significantly year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear primarily due to the partial reversal of the provision relating to the antitrust proceedings conducted by the EU Commission in the second quarter 2021.\n\nProfit before financial result for the year amounted to \u20ac/uni00A010,635/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion, representing a solid improvement over the previous year (2021: \u20ac/uni00A09,870/uni00A0million).\n\nThe EBIT margin came in at 8.6 % (2021: 10.3 %; -/uni200A1.7 percentage points) for the segment. As forecast in the Quarterly Statement to 30 September 2022, the EBIT margin was within the target range of between 7.0 and 9.0 % and therefore in line with ex/uni00AD pectations.\n\nAt \u20ac/uni00A08,283/uni00A0million, the Automotive segment's financial result was significantly up on the previous year (2021: \u20ac/uni00A01,935/uni00A0million). The sharp increase in the year under report was primarily due\n\nto/uni00A0the gain of \u20ac/uni00A07.7/uni00A0billion arising on the remeasurement of the segment's previous at/uni00ADequity interest in BMW Brilliance, which is reported within other financial result. The result from equity/uni00ADac/uni00AD counted investments went down to a net negative amount of \u20ac/uni00A0100 million (2021: net positive amount of \u20ac/uni00A01,520 million). The deterioration reflects the fact that the segment's at/uni00ADequity share of earnings in BMW Brilliance was only included in this line item until 10 February 2022. The net interest result was impacted by income arising on the change in interest rates in connection with the measurement of provisions as well as by interest income earned on positive bank balances.\n\nProfit before tax for the year amounted to \u20ac/uni00A018,918/uni00A0million, a significant improvement year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear (2021: \u20ac/uni00A011,805/uni00A0million).\n\nIn line with the forecast, the Automotive segment's RoCE for 2022 finished at 18.1 % and therefore within the target range of 14 to 19 % (2021: 24 %; -/uni200A5.9 percentage points). The deteriora/uni00AD tion was mainly due to the increase in capital employed resulting from the addition of the net assets identified in BMW Brilliance and the impact of fair value adjustments arising on the purchase price allocation.\n\n## BMW GROUP MARGINS BY SEGMENT\n\n| in %                          | 2022                                | 2021                                | Change   in % points         |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| AUTOMOTIVE                    |                                     |                                     |                              |\n| Gross profit margin /uni200A1 | /one.tf/five.tf/period.tf/six.tf    | /one.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/six.tf   | - /two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf  |\n| EBIT margin /uni200A2         | /eight.tf/period.tf/six.tf          | /one.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/three.tf  | - /one.tf/period.tf/seven.tf |\n| MOTORCYCLES                   |                                     |                                     |                              |\n| Gross profit margin /uni200A1 | /one.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/eight.tf | - /zero.tf/period.tf/five.tf |\n| EBIT margin /uni200A2         | /eight.tf/period.tf/one.tf          | /eight.tf/period.tf/three.tf        | - /zero.tf/period.tf/two.tf  |\n\n- 1 Gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues.\n- 2 Profit before financial result as a percentage of segment revenues.",

Despite these negative factors, sales volume contin/uni00AD ued to grow in 2022, rising to a new record of 202,895/uni00A0units (2021: 194,261/uni00A0units; +/uni200A4.4 %).\n\n## Deliveries worldwide: significant growth achieved in the Americas\n\nA total of 110,788/uni00A0units were delivered to customers in European markets in 2022, similar to the level recorded one year earlier (2021: 111,126/uni00A0 units; -/uni200A0.3 %). Solid growth was reported for France, with deliveries up by 6.7 % to 21,223/uni00A0 units (2021: 19,887/uni00A0units), while Italy finished the year slightly down at a total of 15,668/uni00A0units (2021: 16,034/uni00A0units; -/uni200A2.3 %). Spain performed at the previous year's level (2021: 12,616/uni00A0units; -/uni200A0.9 %). Within a contracting market, deliveries in Germany decreased on a mod/uni00AD erate scale to 24,129/uni00A0units (2021: 25,972/uni00A0units; -/uni200A7.1 %).\n\nIn the Americas region, the number of motorcycles delivered rose sharply to a total of 45,775/uni00A0units (2021: 40,010/uni00A0units; +/uni200A14.4 %), with double/uni00ADdigit growth recorded both in the USA (2022: 17,690/uni00A0units; 2021: 16,030/uni00A0units;+/uni200A10.4 %) and in Brazil (2022: 13,051/uni00A0units; 2021: 11,150/uni00A0units; +/uni200A17.0 %).\n\nDespite the impact of strict coronavirus/uni00ADrelated measures in China, deliveries on that market grew by a solid 7.7 % to 15,404/uni00A0units (2021: 14,309/uni00A0units).\n\nFinancial Performance\n\n## Deliveries of BMW motorcycles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market launches in 2022\n\nA key aspect of the year 2022 for BMW Motorrad was the contin/uni00AD uing process of electrification. In March, a new chapter in two/uni00AD wheeled urban mobility was opened with the market launch of the BMW CE 04 electric scooter (Urban Mobility segment). This new model, together with the BMW CE 02 concept vehicle previously presented, provides a valuable insight into BMW Motorrad's elec/uni00AD trification initiative. Also in March, the model revisions of the 6/uni00ADcylinder K 1600 GT, the K 1600 GTL and the K 1600 B luxury tourers (Touring segment) went on sale.\n\n## New products unveiled by BMW Motorrad\n\nBMW Motorrad presented one new model and four model revisions during the year under report. Two model revisions from the Sports segment were announced in the form of the S 1000 RR (in Sep/uni00AD tember) and the M 1000 RR (in October), the market launches of which are both scheduled for 2023. Following the presentation of the BMW M 1000 R in October, BMW Motorrad unveiled an addi/uni00AD tional M model, this time in the form of a highly dynamic roadster.\n\n## BMW Group largest motorcycle markets 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe two revisions of boxer models showcased during the year - the BMW R 1250 R in October and the BMW R 1250 RS in November - are expected to generate momentum in the Roadster and Sports segments.\n\nIn 2023, BMW Motorrad will be celebrating its centenary as a motorcycle manufacturer. As a preview to the centenary year, special models of the BMW R nine T and the R 18 were presented to the public in December 2022.",

        "page_content": "Financial Performance\n\n## Results of operations of the Motorcycles segment\n\nThe Motorcycles segment EBIT margin (profit before financial result as a percentage of revenues) came in at 8.1 % (2021: 8.3 %; -/uni200A0.2 percentage points) and thus within the forecast target range of between 8 and 10 %.\n\nProfit before tax for the year was significantly higher at \u20ac/uni00A0269/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (2021:/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0228/uni00A0million; +/uni200A18.0 %), mostly driven by higher sales volumes as well as favourable pricing and product mix effects. Both materials and logistics also became more expensive for the Motorcycles segment in 2022, with a corresponding negative impact on segment earnings.\n\nThe RoCE for the Motorcycles segment in 2022 was 24.9 % and therefore above the target range of between 19 and 24 % (2021: 21.9 %; +/uni200A3 percentage points), mainly due to the improved EBIT performance year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear.\n\n## FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT\n\n## Financial Services segment earnings significantly down on previous year\n\nProfit before tax reported by the Financial Services segment for the financial year 2022 amounted to \u20ac 3,205 million (2021: \u20ac 3,753 million; -/uni200A14.6 %), significantly down on the previous year, when earnings had benefited from an exceptionally favourable risk profile. The combination of geopolitical uncertainties and a weaker macroeconomic outlook resulted in a higher credit risk provisioning expense in 2022. Rising inflation and the general increase in interest rates also made conditions for consumers more challenging. However, despite these adverse factors, cred/uni00AD it losses remained at a historically low level. At the same time, earnings continued to benefit from high remarketing proceeds from lease returns.\n\nIn balance sheet terms, business volume decreased slightly com/uni00AD pared to one year earlier to stand at \u20ac 135,689/uni00A0million at/uni00A0the end of the reporting period (2021: \u20ac 139,530/uni00A0million; -/uni200A2.8 %).\n\n## Results of operations of the Financial Services segment\n\nReturn on equity finished at 17.9 % and therefore below the pri/uni00AD or/uni00ADyear level (2021: 22.6 %; -/uni200A4.7 percentage points), mainly due to the year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear decrease in profit before tax. The RoE for 2022 was therefore in line with the revised forecast of between 17 and 20 %. Originally, an RoE within a range of 14 to 17 % was predicted for 2022 in the BMW Group Report 2021.\n\n## Lower volume of new business with retail customers\n\nCredit financing and leasing business with retail customers de/uni00AD creased sharply during the year under report, with a total of 1,545,490 new contracts signed (2021: 1,956,514 contracts; -/uni200A21.0 %), mainly reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and related price increases. Further exacerbating factors were the\n\n## Retail customer contract portfolio in Financial Services segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhigh level of competition within the financial services sector and the general limited availability of new vehicles.\n\nBurdened by these circumstances, the volume of new leasing and credit financing business fell by 23.1 % and 20.0 % respectively. In 2022, leasing accounted for 30.9 % and credit financing for 69.1 % of new business.\n\nNew contracts signed included 321,535 credit financing and leas/uni00AD ing contracts relating to pre/uni00ADowned BMW and MINI brand vehicles (2021: 411,520 contracts; -/uni200A21.9 %).\n\nHigher selling prices achieved by the Automotive segment in com/uni00AD bination with an improved product mix gave rise to a higher aver/uni00AD age financing volume per vehicle in the Financial Services segment during the period under report, partially offsetting the impact of the lower overall number of new contracts signed.

The comments on the BMW Group and Automotive segment provided in earlier sections apply to BMW AG, unless presented differently in the following section. The Financial Statements of BMW AG are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and the relevant supplemen/uni00AD tary requirements contained in the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG).\n\nThe key financial performance indicator for BMW AG is the divi/uni00AD dend payout ratio. This is defined as the unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with IFRS (2021: unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accordance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit in accordance with IFRS; the definition was changed in light of the acquisition of shares in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang). The key non/uni00ADfinan/uni00AD cial performance indicators are essentially identical and concur/uni00AD rent with those of the BMW Group. These are described in detail in the /uni2197/uni00A0Financial Performance section of the Combined Manage/uni00AD ment Report.\n\nDifferences in accounting treatments based on HGB (used for the Company Financial Statements) and IFRS (used for the Group Financial Statements) are mainly to be found in connection with the capitalisation of intangible assets, the creation of valua/uni00AD tion/uni00A0units, the recognition and measurement of financial instru/uni00AD ments and provisions as well as the recognition of deferred tax assets. Differences also arise in the presentation of assets and liabilities and of items in the income statement.\n\n## Business environment and review of operations\n\nThe general and sector/uni00ADspecific environment of BMW/uni00A0AG is essentially the same as that of the BMW Group and is described in the /uni2197 Financial Performance section of the Combined Manage/uni00AD ment Report.\n\nBMW AG develops, manufactures and sells automobiles and motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories manufac/uni00AD tured in/uni00ADhouse, by foreign subsidiaries and by external suppliers, and performs services related to these products. Sales activities are carried out primarily through branches, subsidiaries, inde/uni00AD pendent dealerships and importers. Automobile deliveries de/uni00AD creased by 52,292/uni00A0units to 2,385,299/uni00A0units in the financial year 2022. This figure includes 641,794/uni00A0units relating to series sets supplied to BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, a decrease of 33,201/uni00A0units compared with the previous year.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, BMW AG employed a workforce of 87,183/uni00A0people (31 December 2021: 83,308 people).\n\nThe year 2022 was dominated by a number of ongoing global challenges, in particular semiconductor supply shortages, pan/uni00AD demic/uni00ADrelated lockdowns in China and the impact of the war in Ukraine. Despite the resulting volatile business environment, however, BMW AG can be satisfied with the overall positive course of business during the financial year 2022.\n\nBMW/uni00A0AG's solid financial condition is reflected in the results of operations, financial position and net assets reported for the fi/uni00AD nancial year 2022. Business developed in line with manage/uni00AD ment's revised expectations. This assessment also takes into account events after the end of the reporting period.",

Exchange rate factors also had a positive effect on revenues. In geographical terms, most of the increase in revenues was generated in the USA and Rest of Europe regions. Revenues totalled \u20ac/uni00A098,807/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A088,526/uni00A0million), of which Group internal revenues accounted for \u20ac/uni00A077,843/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A060,373/uni00A0million) or 78.8 % (2021: 68.2 %).\n\nProduction costs went up by 13.0 % to \u20ac/uni00A081,653/uni00A0million, mostly due to higher costs for materials and logistics.\n\nGross profit rose by \u20ac/uni00A0911/uni00A0million to \u20ac/uni00A017,154/uni00A0million.\n\nOverall, selling expenses increased solidly and general adminis/uni00AD trative expenses significantly.\n\nA large proportion of research and development expenses was/uni00A0 related to new vehicle models (including the all/uni00ADelectric BMW/uni200Ai7 * and BMW iX1 * /uni200Amodels and the electrified BMW 7 Series,\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nBMW XM * /uni200Aand BMW X1 models) as well as the development of digital products, automated driving and the /uni2197 NEUE KLASSE . In line with the ramp/uni00ADup of vehicles and kits in connection with the electrification initiative, research and development expenses rose by 5.1 % year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear.\n\nOther operating income increased to \u20ac/uni00A02.529/uni00A0 million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A02,199/uni00A0million), mainly due to higher gains arising on financial transactions. Income from the reversal of other provisions was down.\n\nOther operating expenses increased significantly to \u20ac/uni00A02.889/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A01,460/uni00A0million) and, as in the previous year, mainly comprised expenses from financial transactions and additions to other provisions.\n\nIncome from profit and loss transfer agreements with Group com/uni00AD panies, reported in the line item Result on investments, rose significantly. The increase mainly reflected the substantially high/uni00AD er level of profit transferred by BMW INTEC Beteiligungs GmbH, Munich, made possible largely by improved returns on invest/uni00AD ments received by that entity.\n\nThe financial result deteriorated significantly by \u20ac/uni00A02,500/uni00A0million year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear, mainly due to losses arising in conjunction with the fair value measurement of designated plan assets offset against pension obligations.\n\nThe expense for income taxes related primarily to current tax for the financial year 2022.\n\nAfter deducting the expense for taxes, the Company reported a net profit of \u20ac/uni00A06,311/uni00A0million, compared to \u20ac/uni00A04,910/uni00A0million in the previous year.\n\n- * /uni2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.",

Depreciation and amortisation amounted to \u20ac/uni00A02,452/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A02,846/uni00A0million).\n\nInvestment assets increased by \u20ac/uni00A07,044/uni00A0million to \u20ac/uni00A012,093/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A05,067/uni00A0million) mainly due to a contribution in kind recorded in capital reserves at the level of BMW INTEC Beteili/uni00AD gungs GmbH, Munich. Inventories increased to \u20ac/uni00A07,523/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A07,287/uni00A0million), mainly due to higher levels of raw mate/uni00AD rials and supplies.\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries climbed to \u20ac/uni00A024,510/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A021,019/uni00A0million), mainly due to the higher level of inter/uni00ADcompany trade receivables reported following the reclassification of receiv/uni00AD ables from BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, as a consequence of the acquisition of further shares in that entity.\n\nThe decrease in other receivables and other assets to \u20ac/uni00A02,281/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A04,071/uni00A0million) was mainly attributable to lower re/uni00AD ceivables from companies in which an investment is held, follow/uni00AD ing the acquisition of further shares in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang.\n\nLiquidity within the BMW Group is ensured by means of a liquid/uni00AD ity concept applied uniformly across the Group. This involves concentrating a significant part of the Group's liquidity at the level of BMW AG. An important instrument in this context is the cash pool based at BMW AG.\n\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by \u20ac/uni00A02,617/uni00A0million to \u20ac/uni00A06,207/uni00A0million, mainly due to the net cash outflow from financ/uni00AD ing activities, offset in part by the higher net cash inflow from operating activities.\n\nEquity increased by \u20ac/uni00A01,291/uni00A0million to \u20ac/uni00A020,218/uni00A0million due to the higher unappropriated profit recorded in 2022 compared with the dividend paid out for the financial year 2021. The reduction in other revenue reserves in conjunction with the ongoing share buyback programme had an offsetting effect. The equity ratio changed from 29.3 % to 28.0 %.\n\nIn order to secure pension obligations, cash funds totalling \u20ac/uni00A0382/uni00A0million were transferred to BMW Trust e.V., Munich, in con/uni00AD junction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA), to be invested in plan assets. Plan assets are offset against the related guaranteed obligations. In the previous year, a surplus of assets over liabilities arose which was reported in the BMW AG balance sheet on the line item Surplus of pension and similar plan assets over liabilities.\n\nAfter offsetting pension plan assets against pension obliga/uni00AD tions, provisions for pensions increased from \u20ac/uni00A0422/uni00A0million to \u20ac/uni00A02,871/uni00A0million.\n\nOther provisions increased sharply from \u20ac/uni00A09,995/uni00A0 million to \u20ac/uni00A011,686/uni00A0million, mainly due to additions to provisions for statu/uni00AD tory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranty and product guarantee obliga/uni00AD tions as well as for liability risks.\n\nPayables  to  subsidiaries  rose  to  \u20ac/uni00A0 25,703/uni00A0 million  (2021: \u20ac/uni00A024,462/uni00A0million), mainly reflecting the higher level of inter/uni00ADcom/uni00AD pany trade payables.\n\nDeferred income went up by \u20ac/uni00A0172/uni00A0million to \u20ac/uni00A04,051/uni00A0million and included primarily amounts for services still to be performed relating to service and maintenance contracts.\n\n## Risks and opportunities\n\nBMW AG's performance is essentially dependent on the same set of risks and opportunities that affect the BMW Group and which are described in detail in the /uni2197 Risks and Opportunities\n\nchapter of the Combined Management Report. As a general rule, BMW AG participates in the risks entered into by Group compa/uni00AD nies in proportion to the respective shareholding percentage. At the same time, the result on investments has a significant impact on the earnings of BMW AG.\n\nBMW AG is integrated in the Group/uni00ADwide risk management system and internal control system of the BMW Group. Further infor/uni00AD mation is provided in the /uni2197/uni00A0Internal Control System chapter of the Combined Management Report.\n\n## Outlook\n\nFor the financial year 2023, BMW AG expects an unchanged div/uni00AD idend payout ratio (unappropriated profit of BMW AG in accord/uni00AD ance with HGB in relation to the Group net profit attributable to shareholders of BMW AG in accordance with IFRS), and therefore within the targeted range of between 30 and 40 % (2022: 30.6 %).\n\nDue to its significance in the Group and its close ties with Group companies, expectations for BMW AG with respect to its non/uni00AD financial performance indicators correspond largely to the BMW Group's outlook. This is described in detail in the /uni2197 Outlook chapter of the Combined Management Report.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has issued an unqualified audit opinion on the Company Financial Statements of BMW AG, of which the balance sheet and the income statement are pre/uni00AD sented here. For the purposes of their inclusion in Company Register, the Company Financial Statements of BMW AG for the financial year 2022 will be submitted electronically to the body that maintains the Company Register, and may be obtained via the Company Register website.

Its key objectives are to increase transparency and provide an objective benchmark for capital market participants in order to channel capital flows towards environmentally sustainable economic activities.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy is a classification system that defines eco/uni00AD nomic activities as environmentally sustainable based on fulfil/uni00AD ment of predetermined technical screening criteria.\n\nEssentially, an economic activity can only be classified as sustain/uni00AD able if it substantially contributes to one of the following six en/uni00AD vironmental objectives:\n\n- I. Climate change mitigation\n- II. Climate change adaptation\n- III. Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- IV. Transition to a circular economy\n- V. Pollution prevention and control\n- VI. Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nThis contribution is based on fulfilment of specific predetermined requirements. Moreover, no other environmental objective may be significantly harmed as a result of performing the activity and the Company involved must observe minimum safeguards, among them compliance with human rights.\n\nOn the basis of the phased introduction of the EU Taxonomy in the Delegated Acts, companies such as the BMW/uni00A0Group were required to report the Taxonomy/uni00ADeligible proportion of their rev/uni00AD enues, capital expenditures and operating expenditures for Environmental Objectives I and II for the first time in the previous year. Since reporting year 2022, the reporting requirements have been expanded to include Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned proportions for both/uni00A0 these environmental objectives. The reporting scope is expected to be expanded to the environmental objectives III to VI starting with the reporting year 2024.\n\n## Our holistic understanding of sustainability\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group supports the overarching goal of the EU Taxon/uni00AD omy to promote the private financing of environmentally sustain/uni00AD able economic activities in order to make Europe the world's first climate/uni00ADneutral continent by 2050. As a company aspiring to achieve net zero across its entire value chain by no later than 2050, we welcome all initiatives that serve this objective. As part of this commitment, the BMW/uni00A0Group had already set ambitious, science/uni00ADbased targets for all three scopes in 2020, which it aims to achieve by 2030 (base year 2019). These goals were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Each year, the BMW Group Report informs about the level of progress. /uni2197/uni00A0 Strategy\n\nIn the coming years, the significant growth in electromobility will imply that the majority of carbon emissions will be generated within the upstream value chain, rather than primarily in the use phase. Without the anticipated set of measures to reduce carbon emissions generated within the BMW/uni00A0Group supply chain, these emissions would already exceed actual carbon emissions in the/uni00A0use phase prior to 2030. /uni2197/uni00A0Strategy , /uni2197 Production and Supplier Network , /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions Accordingly, the BMW/uni00A0Group is taking a holistic approach to achieving its sustainability/uni00ADrelated targets and is committed to considering carbon emissions over the entire /uni00A0life cycle of the vehicles produced. /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions How/uni00AD ever,  for  the  economic  activities  that  are  relevant  to  the BMW/uni00A0Group, the EU Taxonomy focuses exclusively on reducing carbon emissions during the use phase that are attributable to low/uni00ADemissions (until 2025) and emissions/uni00ADfree drive systems. Indirect carbon emissions, for instance those produced when generating charging current or during the energy/uni00ADintensive pro/uni00AD duction of high/uni00ADvoltage batteries, are not taken into account in the context of these economic activities. Moreover, the EU Tax/uni00AD onomy only reflects the impact of decarbonisation measures in in/uni00ADhouse production to the extent that they serve to manufacture Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned products or to the extent that they are explic/uni00AD itly included in the description of an activity. The deficit of this approach is shown by the example that increasing the energy efficiency of paint shop processes also reduces carbon emissions in in/uni00ADhouse production when a conventionally powered vehicle is painted. In light of the BMW/uni00A0Group's selected economic activ/uni00AD ities, its sustainability efforts in this regard are not, or are only partially, taken into account in the EU Taxonomy.",

Taxonomy eligibility is an initial indicator of the maximum envi/uni00AD ronmental sustainability potential of economic activities as defined by/uni00A0the EU Taxonomy. Taxonomy alignment, on the other hand, serves as an indicator of an organisation's transformation towards environmentally sustainable economic activities.\n\nAn economic activity is to be seen as Taxonomy/uni00ADeligible if it is described in the Delegated Acts relating to one of the six envi/uni00AD ronmental objectives, regardless of whether that economic activity meets the technical screening criteria stipulated in those Delegated Acts. Following an analysis, the BMW/uni00A0Group's business activities can best be summarised under the following economic activities 1 :\n\n- - Economic activity 3.3 'Manufacture of low carbon technolo/uni00AD gies for transport' including the production of passenger cars and motorcycles.\n- - Economic activity 6.5 'Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles' including the acquisition, financing, lease and operation of automobiles and motor/uni00AD cycles.\n\nBased on the descriptions of the two economic activities listed for Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation' and in/uni00A0 consideration of the additional clarification by the EU Com/uni00AD mission regarding the Taxonomy eligibility of vehicles with com bustion engines under economic activity 3.3, a large part of the BMW/uni00A0Group's business model falls within the scope of the EU/uni00A0Taxonomy Annex. /uni200A2\n\nOnly the sale of parts and components, such as after/uni00ADsales busi/uni00AD ness excluding the provision of repair services, the supply of components for production to BMW Brilliance up to and including\n\n## Explanatory comments on reporting procedures\n\nEconomic activities are described in the Delegated Act on environmental objectives 1 and 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFulfilment of technical screening criteria: substantial contribution to at least one of the environmental objectives\n\n+\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEconomic activity does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10 February 2022/uni200A 3 and/or to other third parties, and banking and insurance services performed by our non/uni00ADautomotive Financial Services segment, are not described as economic activities in the Delegated Regulation and are therefore not Taxonomy/uni00ADeligi/uni00AD ble.\n\nConsequently, in order to determine the Taxonomy alignment of the two aforementioned economic activities in the reporting year, they must be reviewed against the technical screening criteria relevant to them:\n\n- 1)  They make a substantial contribution to the fulfilment of the environmental objective based on the specific carbon emissions for the vehicles in question.\n- 2)  They do not cause any significant harm to other environ/uni00AD mental objectives based on the specific requirements for each relevant economic activity ('Do no significant harm' or 'DNSH').\n\nIt must also be ensured that the organisation carrying out the economic activities has established minimum safeguards aimed at guaranteeing compliance with human rights in particular and also minimum safeguards relating to bribery, corruption, taxation and fair competition.\n\nCompany establishes minimum safeguard procedures for human rights, bribery and corruption, taxation and fair competition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Substantial contribution\n\nThe BMW Group has reviewed its contribution to the environ/uni00AD mental objectives 'Climate change mitigation' and 'Climate change adaptation' for the reporting year. Economic activity 3.3 and economic activity 6.5 both make a substantial contribution to the achievement of Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation' due to the manufacture, financing and leasing of low/uni00ADemissions (PHEV < 50 g CO2/km WLTP until 2025) and zero/uni00ADemissions vehicles (BEV and motorcycles with 0g CO2/km).

In this context, the BMW Group carries out environmental impact assessments in accordance with Directive 2011/92/EU during the construction of new and expansion of existing sites within the EU that also take account of water and biodiversity. At locations outside the EU, the BMW Group carries out an environmental impact assessment based on EU requirements. Moreover, a certified environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 has been implemented at all BMW Group production sites and all local legal requirements are met. /uni2197/uni00A0Resource Management at all  locations\n\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objectives III and VI are fulfilled for economic activity 3.3.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transition to a circular economy\n\nThe requirements for both economic activities of the BMW Group to do no significant harm to Environmental Objective IV differ for each stage of the value chain. We fulfil these requirements during the manufacturing process for BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles (economic activity/uni00A03.3) by, for example, using secondary raw materials in our products, designing products to facilitate their recycling, managing waste at our production sites in a way that prioritises recycling over disposal as well as registering substances of con/uni00AD cern systematically along the entire supply chain. With regard to the use phase and recycling of BMW Group vehicles (economic activity/uni00A06.5), we have set up appropriate processes to comply with recycling requirements and established measures for man/uni00AD aging waste during maintenance and at the end of the life cycle. All these criteria also form part of our comprehensive approach to the /uni2197/uni00A0Transition to a circular economy .\n\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective/uni00A0IV are fulfilled for economic activities 3.3 and 6.5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pollution prevention and control\n\nThe requirements to do no significant harm to Environmental Objective/uni00A0V differ considerably for economic activity 3.3 and eco/uni00AD nomic activity 6.5.\n\nWith regard to economic activity/uni00A03.3, the BMW/uni00A0Group has estab/uni00AD lished corresponding processes which aim to monitor and ensure legal compliance with any prohibitions and limits relating to the use of chemical substances at vehicle level. All substances used by the BMW/uni00A0Group are in compliance with national and  European laws. The use of any other substances, such as those classified under the CLP Regulation which go beyond current prohibitions established in applicable legislation (including the REACH\n\nRegulation), is reviewed. Substitutes are sought for substances if their use cannot be avoided owing to current societal needs, taking into account factors such as economic and technical requirements.\n\nNever the less, it is not possible to meet all criteria to do no sig/uni00AD nificant harm to Environmental Objective/uni00A0V in the case of eco/uni00AD nomic activity 6.5. Current PHEV models under 50 g CO2/km WLTP offered by the BMW/uni00A0Group and other manufacturers may make a significant contribution as defined by the EU Taxonomy. However, manufacturer specifications for air pollutant emissions in real driving conditions (real driving emissions, RDE) cannot be declared as 80 % of the limit as required by the EU Taxonomy with reference to table 2 in the notes to the Clean Vehicles Direc/uni00AD tive, due to potentially extreme driving situations. All PHEVs in the vehicle portfolio for economic activity 6.5 must therefore be considered as not Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned, even if they meet these specifications in everyday driving situations.\n\nFor the remaining BEV in the BMW Group's vehicle portfolio, further deductions have to be made in the context of economic activity 6.5. In the case of individual models in light of the require/uni00AD ments for rolling resistance coefficients for tyres and in particular the external rolling noise of tyres. Owing to the limited availability of data, the eligibility of the models concerned is calculated in a simplified manner based on the tyres approved for these models, weighted by their purchase volumes and take rates.\n\nThe DNSH requirements for Environmental Objective/uni00A0V are ful/uni00AD filled for economic activity 3.3; however, not all are fulfilled for economic activity 6.5.",

These require the implementation of processes to ensure compliance with due diligence obligations both within an organisation and in the stages of the upstream and downstream value chain that have been outsourced.

In its /uni2197/uni00A0Policy statement on respect for human rights and environment/uni00ADrelated standards , the BMW/uni00A0Group has, among other things, committed to compliance with the following standards for minimum safe/uni00AD guards as defined in Article/uni00A018 of the Taxonomy Regulation: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Princi/uni00AD ples on Business and Human Rights and the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact, which we signed back in 2001.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0Purchasing and supplier network , /uni2197/uni00A0Compliance and human rights\n\nThe minimum safeguard requirements are met.\n\n## EU Taxonomy performance indicators\n\nPlease refer to the remarks in the glossary for the definition and calculation of the Taxonomy/uni00ADspecific performance indicators rev/uni00AD enues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure. /uni2197/uni00A0Glossary\n\nThe proportion of revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure relating to eligible and non/uni00ADeligible economic activ/uni00AD ities are shown in each case as an aggregate percentage for the BMW/uni00A0Group. Only Taxonomy/uni00ADeligible revenues, capital expend/uni00AD iture and operating expenditure as listed for Environmental Objective I 'Climate change mitigation' are disclosed, given that Taxonomy/uni00ADeligible revenues, capital expenditure and operating\n\nexpenditure for Environmental Objective II 'Climate change adaptation' are a subset of the values for Environmental Objec/uni00AD tive I 'Climate change mitigation'. This approach avoids double counting of revenues, capital expenditure and operating expend/uni00AD iture when determining the KPI in the numerator across multiple economic activities.\n\nIn the case of capital expenditure, all Taxonomy/uni00ADeligible expend/uni00AD iture is allocated to the two economic activities 3.3 and 6.5. In most cases, values from financial data were allocated directly to the economic activities for all three performance indicators, based for example on the drivetrain or the vehicle model. In the remaining cases, an allocation mechanism was used for each economic activity and each performance indicator. For Taxon/uni00AD omy/uni00ADeligible and Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned capital expenditure, the allocator is based on long/uni00ADterm Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned revenues generated from the automobile and motorcycle business for eco/uni00AD nomic activity 3.3 and on the Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned financing volume for new customers in the current financial year for economic activity  6.5:\n\n- - Allocator for economic activity 3.3: (BEV + PHEV (<50g)) x Automotive segment revenues (2023-2028)\n- - Allocator for economic activity 6.5: (DNSH alignment factor x BEV) x proportion of financing volume attributable to new customer contracts (2022)\n\nFor capital expenditure, the allocator is based on detailed long/uni00AD term corporate planning for the next six years, as approved each year by the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.\n\nThis allocator is used for capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment (including right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse assets), intangible assets and expenditure on research and development for economic activity 3.3, and for capital expenditure on leased products for economic activity 6.5. For operating expenditure, the formula is also applied to non/uni00ADcapitalised development costs.\n\nFor other operating expenditure (non/uni00ADcapitalised right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse assets (lessee), maintenance/repair expenses) relating to eco/uni00AD nomic activity 3.3, the allocator is based on the Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned revenues generated from the automobile and motorcycle busi/uni00AD ness in the reporting period.\n\n## Interpretation of the performance indicators for reporting year 2022\n\nThe following overview tables summarise the performance indi/uni00AD cators revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure resulting from Taxonomy/uni00ADeligible and Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned eco/uni00AD nomic activities of the BMW Group.\n\n## - BMW Group perspective\n\nTaxonomy/uni00ADaligned revenues of the BMW Group amounted to \u20ac/uni00A015,705/uni00A0million, corresponding to 11 % of total Group reve/uni00AD nues. The Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned share of capital expenditure was 21 % (\u20ac/uni00A05,100/uni00A0million). Operating expenditure incurred for/uni00A0 Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned economic activities amounted to \u20ac/uni00A01,661/uni00A0million, corresponding to almost 29 % of Taxonomy/uni00AD eligible operating expenditure.\n\n## - Economic activity 3.3, 'Manufacture of low carbon tech/uni00AD nologies for transport'\n\nThe Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned share of revenues generated by the Automotive and Motorcycle segments corresponded to 10.7 % (economic activity 3.3 'Manufacture of low/uni00ADcarbon technol/uni00AD ogies for transport') of total Group revenues. As a percentage of external revenues of the two segments, the  Taxonomy/uni00AD aligned share rises to 14 %. /uni2197 Segment information",

This proportion more than doubles to 43 % in relation to additions recorded by the Automotive and Motorcycle seg/uni00AD ments. The latter highlights the high proportion of Taxonomy/uni00AD aligned capital expenditure of the Automotive segment.\n\n## - Economic activity 6.5, 'Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles'\n\nThe Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned shares for the three performance indicators were at a low single/uni00ADdigit level for the Financial Services segment. This was due to the fact that - compared to the Automotive segment - there is a time lag before the effects of the vehicle fleet electrification ramp/uni00ADup are felt in the financing and leasing lines of business. A further reason is the stricter DNSH requirements for economic activity 6.5, in particular those relating to environmental objective V 'Pollution prevention and control', which lead to the exclu/uni00AD sion of all PHEV and a significant restriction in the recognition of BEV in the scope of EU Taxonomy reporting (for details see Section 'Avoidance of significant harm'). In addition, with economic activity 6.5, third/uni00ADparty brands can only be included in the vehicle portfolio under restrictive conditions, such as for  the  purpose  of  assigning  tyre  categories  or  WLTP emissions values as part of the process of testing compliance with the/uni00A0DNSH criteria. As a result, no specific deductions can be allocated, with the consequence that the models con/uni00AD cerned must be excluded from the scope of reporting on Tax/uni00AD onomy alignment.\n\nThe growing share of zero/uni00ADemissions vehicles, the development and production methods used, and - where applicable - contri/uni00AD butions made to other environmental objectives as yet to be defined are expected to lead to an increase in Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned revenues, capital expenditure and operating expenditure. Due to the high level of investment in the transformation of our business activities, for example in the electrification of our vehicles and research into alternative drivetrains, these economic activities have the potential to become Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned over time. Over/uni00AD all, we anticipate that the proportion of Taxonomy/uni00ADaligned eco/uni00AD nomic activities will steadily rise as a result of the increasing electrification of our product portfolio. /uni2197 Strategy\n\nThe contribution of the two economic activities considered for Environmental Objective II is subsumed in the contribution re/uni00AD ported for Environmental Objective I.

During the year under report, numerous innovations again resulted in processes being optimised, products improved and new technologies introduced to make everyday life easier for our customers.\n\n## Vision UI/UX: user interaction and the user interface of the future\n\nWith its BMW i Vision Dee concept vehicle, the BMW/uni00A0Group is demonstrating how interaction between people and automobiles could look like going forward. 'Dee' is a sporty, elegant mid/uni00ADsize sedan that epitomises the core values of the BMW brand in a new, reduced design language. It is the most recent affirmation of our digital expertise and stands for Digital Emotional Experi/uni00AD ence. 'Dee' is yet another milestone on the road to the NEUE KLASSE and forms an innovative link between everyday reality and the virtual world. As of 2025, with the NEUE KLASSE the BMW Group will be taking a major technological leap forward and creating innovative drivetrain and digital modules for all relevant classes of vehicle across the BMW model range. Electrification, digitalisation and circularity are the key elements that signify the transformation currently taking place within the automotive\n\nindustry, which is being driven forward at a considerable pace with this new generation of vehicles. The BMW/uni00A0Group has already demonstrated the great potential of the circular economy princi/uni00AD ple with its BMW i Vision Circular. The BMW i Vision Dee now illustrates the impact that digital technology will have on driving pleasure in years to come.\n\n## MINI Concept Aceman\n\nThe Concept Aceman marks the dawn of a new era for the MINI brand. The crossover model is a preview of a completely new type of vehicle that is destined to occupy the position between the MINI Cooper and the MINI Countryman in the model family going forward. This concept vehicle reflects how MINI is reinventing itself to be part of an all/uni00ADelectric future and what the brand stands for by creating an electrified go/uni00ADkart eeling, digital features for all the senses and a keen focus on minimising its ecological foot/uni00AD print.\n\n'Charismatic Simplicity' - the new design language - pares back the look of the MINI models of the future to the essentials. The exterior of the MINI Concept Aceman features a prominent front end with an octagonal, closed, illuminated radiator grille element, an athletic shoulder section and a powerful rear fitted with ver/uni00AD tically arranged taillights. The interior is greatly reduced and focuses on a round OLED display that enables the driver to personalise the sound, interaction, projection and light via three 'Experience Modes'. Like all future MINI models, the MINI Con/uni00AD cept Aceman is designed completely without leather, is practi/uni00AD cally chrome/uni00ADfree and features a variety of sustainable materi/uni00AD als.",

Since the launch of Operating System 7 in 2018, a Remote Software Upgrade (i.e. updating the vehicle's software remotely) has been available for BMW vehicles. In addition to its remote software upgrades, the Group is continually releasing new functions and features. Since autumn 2022, for example, a service for conven/uni00AD iently paying parking fees has been available in BMW vehicles with Operating Systems 7 and 8 in Germany and Austria - and other countries are set to follow. Upon arriving in a parking zone, the vehicle automatically detects whether the service is available at that location and displays the payment option accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BMW Theatre Screen\n\nThe BMW Theatre Screen is much more than just a screen fitted in the rear of the new BMW 7 Series: it raises the bar in terms of in/uni00ADcar entertainment and creates a cinema/uni00AD like entertainment  experience  for  back/uni00ADseat  passengers. During  a  journey,  the  31.3/uni00ADinch  (79.5  cm)  display  can stream popular apps via the vehicle's 5G connectivity and pre/uni00ADinstalled  Amazon  Fire  TV  (depending  on  the  coun/uni00AD try/uni00ADspecific Fire TV offering; in China, Huawei and Iqiyi).\n\nWith 'Functions/uni00ADon/uni00ADDemand', additional functions can also be bought in, long after the vehicle has been purchased, or even booked for a specific period.\n\n## The vehicle as a digital experience\n\nIn 2021, the BMW/uni00A0Group launched its Operating System 8, fea/uni00AD turing a new display and control system. Since then, every new BMW model has been equipped with this flexible, scalable info/uni00AD tainment operating system. Currently, the latest BMW 7 Series is presenting the full capabilities of Operating System 8, ranging from 'Augmented View' in the information display to a genuine cinema experience with the 'BMW Theatre Screen'. The 'My Modes' function can be used to create a holistic user experience within the vehicle by changing vehicle features as well as displays and interior ambience, depending on the 'My Mode' selected. The My Mode 'Digital Art' feature brings digital art to the BMW Curved Display for the first time.\n\nOne key advantage of BMW Operating System 8 is its scalability across all classes of vehicle. Since its launch, the system has been rolled out across the compact, mid/uni00ADsize and luxury classes and systematically enhanced in line with customer demand. The focus is on new entertainment offerings such as the integration of AirConsole and the expansion to include third/uni00ADparty apps via the Faurecia Aptoide app store.\n\nDigitalisation also enables innovations, simplifications and ad/uni00AD vances outside the vehicle. With the My BMW App and the MINI App, which are now being used by over nine million customers worldwide on their smartphones, it is possible, for example, to plan travel routes, request information on the vehicle's condition, or control the charging process.\n\n## Software expertise at the BMW/uni00A0Group\n\nTwenty years ago, the BMW/uni00A0Group began developing its own software with the founding of BMW Car IT. Since then, the Com/uni00AD pany has continued to expand its teams of developers to form a global network. Beginning with the Ulm site in southern Germany, its software expertise has been bolstered by the joint ventures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remote software upgrades *\n\nThe software architecture, which has been successively developed over the last 15 years, enables BMW to install software  on  all  control  units  in  the  vehicle's  electrical system within a matter of minutes. Over 30 BMW models worldwide can now be upgraded using this method. The last remote software upgrade in 2022 was already acces/uni00AD sible to 3.8 million BMW Group vehicles. The free upgrades include improvements and feature enhancements in the areas of infotainment, driving, drivetrain, driver assistance, convenience and safety.\n\n- *  The availability and content of remote software upgrades depend on the country, model, equipment and software version installed.",

Among other benefits, the app gives BMW and MINI customers prioritised access to rental vehicles in Ger/uni00AD many, Belgium and Luxembourg. Furthermore, the BMW/uni00A0Group offers its business customers and fleet operators individualised mobility solutions with a focus on flexible, keyless vehicle use and based on digital, data/uni00ADdriven vehicle management that boosts process efficiency and enhances the customer  experience.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's range of services also includes comprehensive charging solutions for the home, the workplace and on the road. /uni2197 Expanding charging infrastructure and enabling faster charging\n\n## Digital connectivity and automation\n\nAutomated functions and digitally connected vehicles can help cut emissions, reduce the risk of accidents and ease traffic con/uni00AD gestion. The BMW/uni00A0Group is therefore firmly committed to making further progress in this area - with a clear focus on customer convenience and safety.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group has been pooling the development of assistance and automation functions at its Autonomous Driving Campus north of Munich since 2017. It also operates research facilities in both China and the USA, enabling it to include its two largest markets in terms of traffic/uni00ADrelated as well as traffic law specifics right from the outset. In order to take the diverse demands placed on automated driving systems into account from the beginning, the BMW/uni00A0Group also has a globally unique driving simulation centre in Munich, making it possible to test driver assistance systems and automated driving functions in a realistic setting.\n\nOne of the many successes to come from our development work is the innovative technology toolkit, which is integrated in the BMW/uni00A0iX\u00b9 as well as in the new BMW/uni00A07 Series and is being rolled out successively across the entire range of vehicles. The toolkit excels in terms of its computing power, its highly efficient sensor technology, the continuous improvement of the software via da/uni00AD ta/uni00ADdriven development and the use of artificial intelligence (AI). It also forms the basis for our upcoming automated features, including a highly automated Level 3 function for the new BMW 7 Series.\n\nWhen it comes to developing the next generation of software solutions for automated driving, the BMW/uni00A0Group has been col/uni00AD laborating with Qualcomm Technologies and Arriver since 2022. Together, we aim to develop technologies ranging from New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) solutions to advanced Level 2 driv/uni00AD ing assistance systems and the Level 3 functionalities of highly automated driving. Since 2021, the BMW/uni00A0Group has also been involved in the Munich/uni00ADbased research project TEMPUS\u00b2, which explores questions of technical feasibility.\n\n## Safety of automated smart systems\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's highest priority is to ensure that its automat/uni00AD ed systems operate in a safe, secure manner. It is therefore pro/uni00AD moting the development of an industry/uni00ADwide ISO standard for highly and fully automated driving functions, a project it has been involved in right from an early stage. The work has culminated in an ISO Technical Report, which is due to be published as an ISO Technical Specification in the course of 2023, and sets out uni/uni00AD form technical standards for safe automated driving.\n\n## Drivetrain technologies of the future\n\nWhen developing drivetrain technologies, the BMW/uni00A0Group focus/uni00AD es on the needs of its customers worldwide. For this reason we are constantly developing existing drivetrain technologies in the interests of efficiency, decarbonisation and resource conserva/uni00AD tion. At the same time, we continue to research new drivetrain technologies with the ultimate aim of developing them for series production.\n\n## New generation of battery cells\n\nHigh/uni00ADperformance, innovative and sustainably produced battery cells are the key to success for individual electric mobility. With its NEUE KLASSE models, the BMW/uni00A0Group will be entering a new era of e/uni00ADmobility as of 2025, using newly developed round battery cells  for  the  first  time  that  are  ideally  suited  to  the  new architecture.\n\nThe sixth generation of our lithium/uni00ADion cells represents a giant technological leap forward compared with the previous genera/uni00AD tion, effectively increasing energy density by more than 20 %, charging speed by up to 30 % and range by around 30 %. The carbon emissions generated by cell production will be reduced by up to 60/uni00A0%.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group has placed orders worth a double/uni00ADdigit billion euro amount prior to the production of the new BMW battery cells.",

Based on current market assumptions, the cost can potentially be reduced by up to 50 % compared to the current fifth generation.\n\n## Hydrogen fuel cell technology\n\nDuring the period under report, we began testing the BMW iX5 Hydrogen with its hydrogen fuel cell drive system under everyday conditions. We aim to test the interaction between the CO2/uni00ADfree drivetrain, the chassis technology and the electronic systems in realistic situations. In order to gain further experience, a pilot fleet of the all/uni00ADelectric model has been in production since the end of 2022.\n\nHydrogen fuel cell technology has the potential to become a sus/uni00AD tainable complement to battery/uni00ADpowered e/uni00ADdrive systems. The technology really comes into its own when a comprehensive electric charging infrastructure is not available; it could also be deployed for long/uni00ADdistance use or in larger classes of vehicle. Depending on market requirements and developments, we in/uni00AD tend to offer the model as a series production vehicle in the sec/uni00AD ond half of this decade.\n\nThe BMW iX5 Hydrogen is equipped with fuel cells developed in collaboration with the Toyota Motor Corporation. The fuel cell stack and the overall drive system have both been developed in/uni00ADhouse. The collaboration project has been in place since 2013 and aims to optimise the technology's suitability for everyday use in each company's own series production vehicles.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is supporting initiatives across Europe with the aim of establishing an efficient, hydrogen/uni00ADbased economy and promoting the production of green /uni2197 Hydrogen .\n\n## Inspiration and cooperation\n\nGood ideas often emerge when different partners work together. According to this principle, we are focusing on cooperations in which the strengths of the BMW/uni00A0Group complement those of established partners as well as innovation drivers such as start/uni00AD ups, enabling us to continue developing our innovative strengths.\n\nThe global network of BMW/uni00A0Group Technology Offices is also making an essential contribution to maintaining the Group's leading role in terms of innovation.\n\nThese offices are strategically positioned worldwide and focus on key hotspots of technology and innovation. The potential of new technologies is therefore being explored in pilot projects and transferred to the Group's centralised teams. Whether manufac/uni00AD turing, developing smart city solutions or the mobility of the future, these Technology Offices are driving forward innovations that benefit the Group in all its lines of business.\n\n## Metaverse\n\nThe virtual worlds of the Metaverse are a catalyst   for  digitalisation for the BMW/uni00A0Group, as the use of X/uni00ADReality (VR/AR/MR) technolo/uni00AD gies and Web 3.0 generates benefits across all areas of the value chain.  Our holistic activities comprise the following three pillars:\n\n- 1.  Corporate  Metaverse  (virtualisation  of  internal  processes: virtual  working  platform  for  collaboration  and  interaction, training and recruiting)\n- 2.  Commercial  Metaverse  (in  the  'digital  brand'  context,  the new potential for interaction becomes possible for brands and customers  alike)\n- 3.  In/uni00ADCar Metaverse (offers customers new options for informa/uni00AD tion management, increased productivity, communication and all/uni00ADround entertainment within the vehicle)\n\nUsing the mixed reality approach, which was introduced during the year under report, a team of engineers from BMW M GmbH has developed an immersive driving experience for the BMW M2. Using XR goggles, drivers can immerse themselves in a virtual\n\nworld to master high/uni00ADrev challenges, similar to a racing game. Integrated gaming elements, such as avoiding obstacles or col/uni00AD lecting virtual coins, enhance the immersive in/uni00ADcar experience. The system takes all the BMW M2's axes of motion and rotation into account. The vehicle itself becomes the controller, in this case the fastest controller in the world.",

The results are now publicly available in the /uni2197 Trend Radar . Scientific institutions, start/uni00ADups and even potential partners can make use of these.\n\n## Worldwide culture of innovation\n\nGlobal dialogue with start/uni00ADups is an important means for the BMW Group to gain impetus. This is based on three pillars, com/uni00AD prising /uni2197 BMW i Ventures (through which we invest in technology start/uni00ADups), the MINI brand/uni00ADinitiated start/uni00ADup /uni2197 Accelerator URBAN/uni00ADX that focuses on urban living and the /uni2197 BMW/uni00A0Startup Garage (which serves as the BMW/uni00A0Group's venture client unit and searches for innovations that represent a significant benefit for products, services, systems and processes). The aim of the programme is to evaluate and empower start/uni00ADups to become suppliers and partners.\n\n## Shaping the future of mobility\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is involved in numerous research and imple/uni00AD mentation projects for developing new mobility concepts. The main focus is on pilot projects that improve the quality of life and promote more sustainable urban mobility.\n\n*\n\nFor example, the BMW Group is working with the city of Munich to develop urban projects with the involvement of the local pop/uni00AD ulation. Among other things, this entails making more efficient use of the available road space, establishing new on/uni00ADdemand services, and promoting parking space management. Moreover, in the Berlin project /uni2197/uni00A0'New Mobility Berlin' we are jointly develop/uni00AD ing solutions to meet people's changing mobility needs and address the shortage of space in a growing city. The project is helping to create shared spaces in order to provide, for example, mobility stations for car sharing or rental bikes. Based on a long/uni00AD term cooperation with the City of Rotterdam, we are also working on numerous pilot projects; from the better networking of differ/uni00AD ent modes of transport (intermodality) to the more efficient use of charging infrastructure.\n\n## Vehicles as part of the power grid\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is conducting its own research and development work to integrate electrified vehicles in the power grid, thereby contributing to the energy transition, grid stability, and the carbon/uni00ADfree operation of electrified vehicles. The focus is on technologies such as smart charging, a key component of the /uni2197/uni00A0BMW/uni00A0ChargeForward service, which enables customers in numer/uni00AD ous states of the USA to synchronise their charging behaviour with the current grid load and the use of renewable energy. Another cross/uni00ADsector initiative is the so/uni00ADcalled /uni2197 Bidirectional Charging  Management (BCM) research project, which is being sub/uni00AD sidised by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action. BCM transforms electric vehicles into mobile energy storage devices and thus into a part of the energy grid in that their batteries can not only absorb electricity, but at the same time feed it in the opposite direction into the grid operator's power supply. In the V2G (Vehicle to Grid) project together with the City of Rotterdam, the BMW/uni00A0Group is also conducting research into using the batteries of electrified vehicles to store surplus renewable energy - with a positive impact on the environment and energy efficiency as well as cutting costs for customers.\n\n## Worldwide cooperations and partnerships\n\nTo ensure its long/uni00ADterm success, the BMW/uni00A0Group enters into targeted cooperations and partnerships with companies from various industries with the aim of pooling expertise and imple/uni00AD menting innovations as swiftly as possible. Several of the Group's largest collaborations and investments are listed below:\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the BMW/uni00A0Group, Qualcomm Technol/uni00AD ogies and Arriver Software jointly entered into a long/uni00ADterm cooperation to develop solutions for next/uni00ADgeneration automated driving and signed an agreement to that effect. The three com/uni00AD panies aim to develop technologies ranging from New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) solutions and advanced Level 2 driving assistance systems to the Level 3 functionalities of high/uni00AD ly automated driving. The joint development of software functions is based on BMW's current software toolkit for automated driving. Within the terms of the cooperation, more than 1,400 specialists will work together at various locations worldwide, including sites in Germany, the USA, Sweden, China, Romania and the BMW AD Test Centre Sokolov in the Czech Republic.\n\nSince the joint acquisition of the HERE mapping service by the BMW/uni00A0Group, the Mercedes/uni00ADBenz Group and Audi in 2015, the three partners have been working on high/uni00ADprecision digital maps that can be linked to real/uni00ADtime vehicle data. These maps will form the foundation for the next generation of location/uni00ADbased services and are also the basis for new assistance systems. As an inde/uni00AD pendent platform, HERE remains accessible for the auto motive industry as well as other partners. In the year under report, the location data and technology platform had nine direct and indirect shareholders: Audi, Bosch, the BMW/uni00A0Group, Continental, Intel, Mitsubishi, the Mercedes/uni00ADBenz Group, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, and Pioneer. In November 2022, the BMW/uni00A0Group and HERE Technologies jointly announced that HERE HD Live Map/uni00A0HERE's high/uni00ADresolution road map - will be used for automated driving functions.",

This is an important step in ensuring that electric mobility is convenient to use, even over long distances. The founding partners, i.e. the BMW/uni00A0Group, the Mercedes/uni00ADBenz Group, the Ford Motor Company and Porsche, together with Volkswagen and Audi, all participated in equal measure. In 2019, the Hyundai Motor Group with its Hyundai and Kia brands joined IONITY as an additional shareholder. In April 2022, BlackRock became a further investor, enabling IONITY to continue investing in the densification and expansion of the high/uni00ADpower charging network. /uni2197/uni00A0 Expanding charging infrastructure and enabling faster charging\n\nIn  collaboration  with  Amazon  Web  Services  (AWS),  the BMW/uni00A0Group is developing innovative cloud technologies for pro/uni00AD cessing vehicle data. The two companies are also working to/uni00AD gether to develop commercial standard cloud solutions for the secure handling of vehicle data. The agreement is a continuation of the partnership between BMW and AWS in the field of vehicle data that began back in 2015. As in all previous collaborations with AWS, the BMW/uni00A0Group retains full and exclusive control over the data and complies with the data protection regulations applicable in its respective markets.\n\nSince the launch of the first BMW voice assistant (BMW Intelli/uni00AD gent Personal Assistant) in 2018, voice interaction has become an increasingly important part of the BMW iDrive display and operating concept. The next generation of the voice assistant will be based on Amazon's Alexa technology, thus enabling an even more natural dialogue between driver and vehicle.\n\nInformation on the overall scope of the BMW/uni00A0Group's research and development activities is available in the section on the Group's results of operations. /uni2197 Financial performance\n\n## PRODUCT QUALITY AND SAFETY\n\nAll BMW/uni00A0Group products and services are required to meet the highest standards in terms of quality and safety, which are ensured by the Group's comprehensive quality management system. All measures taken reflect the BMW/uni00A0Group's constant focus on human safety.\n\n## Effective safety systems\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group regards the safety of its vehicle's occupants and road users in general as its foremost priority when developing its products. Optimum chassis tuning, highly effective braking sys/uni00AD tems and stable passenger compartments are key factors in this context. Moreover, BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles are equipped with state/uni00AD of/uni00ADthe/uni00ADart safety systems that reduce the risk of accidents and injuries (active safety systems such as collision warning or lane departure warning systems) as well as mitigate the consequences in the event of an accident (passive safety systems such as airbags or seat belts).\n\nWe work continuously to further improve the safety of our vehi/uni00AD cles. For example, since 2021 the BMW/uni00A0iX /uni200A* has been setting new standards in this field with its active safety systems. These lat/uni00AD est/uni00ADgeneration safety features are currently being transferred to other models, including the BMW 7 Series and the BMW X1. The sustained high safety level of BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles was again confirmed externally by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) in the course of 2022. Following the BMW/uni00A0iX /uni200A* , which was awarded 5 stars in the previous year, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer and the BMW X1 also earned this maximum rating in the year under report. These results also underpin the BMW/uni00A0 Group's premium aspiration in terms of vehicle  safety. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 416/uni00AD1\n\n## Quality management\n\nProduct safety is an essential part of the BMW/uni00A0Group's compre/uni00AD hensive quality management system, which is in place to ensure that its products are safe, of excellent quality and legally compli/uni00AD ant. From the development stage to manufacturing, the Group's products are therefore subject to strict testing procedures. How/uni00AD ever, in our view, quality management goes much further. Any information from customers regarding potential deviations from quality standards are systematically followed up. The BMW/uni00A0Group informs the relevant authorities without delay if required to do so for market/uni00ADrelated reasons. This is especially true for safety/uni00AD related and compliance/uni00ADrelevant aspects.\n\nIf a safety risk or a compliance/uni00ADrelated defect is found, the BMW/uni00A0Group implements all the measures required to remedy the issue in close coordination with the responsible authorities. Safety/uni00AD and compliance/uni00ADrelated technical actions affected around 3.4/uni00A0million vehicles during the year under report. These actions were all of a voluntary nature and carried out in close coordina/uni00AD tion with the authorities. The BMW/uni00A0Group works according to the principle of prevention. To avoid technical actions of this type going forward, the BMW/uni00A0Group has developed a comprehensive programme that is in place as of 2023.\n\n## Pollutants management\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group aspires to comply with all legal requirements regarding the use and handling of pollutants at every link in the value chain and also insists on corresponding requirements throughout its entire supply chain. To the extent possible, the use of problematic substances is ruled out right from the vehicle design stage. In this respect we use the /uni2197/uni00A0Global Automotive Declar/uni00AD able Substance List (GADSL) as a guideline. At the same time, we are working to reduce pollutant emissions in the interior of our vehicles to an absolute minimum. All BMW, MINI and Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brand vehicles are equipped as standard with interior air filters",

Since 2020, the BMW/uni00A0Group has been using air filters equipped with nanofibre technology that are specially designed to prevent certain microbial particles and allergens as well as ultra/uni00ADfine particulate matter from entering the vehicle.\n\n## Sensitising and empowering customers\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group provides its customers with a broad range of information regarding the proper use of its products and servic/uni00AD es. Information on safety, the correct operation of vehicles, and health protection is available in both printed and digital form (online or via app). The information is supplemented by detailed notes and background information on the services, accessories and components pertaining to each individual vehicle.\n\nWith the /uni2197 BMW M Driving Experience , the BMW/uni00A0Group offers driver and rider safety training for BMW, MINI and BMW Motorrad brand vehicles in/uni00A0 25 countries. In addition to the product experience itself, participants learn how to handle their vehicles in a safe manner and are made aware of potentially dangerous situations when using public roads. In 2022, more than 100,000 customers worldwide took part in these training courses.\n\n## Customer data protection\n\nIn view of the increasing scale of digitalisation and the higher level of IT risks, the BMW/uni00A0Group regards data protection as a key responsibility. Strict data protection requirements are therefore taken into account at an early stage when developing functions and services. Any personal data required in the course of contact with our customers are only collected, processed or used to the extent legally permitted and with the active consent of the data subject. The BMW/uni00A0Group deploys an individually configurable data protection menu to ensure transparency, informational self/uni00ADdetermination and thus data sovereignty for all its customers.\n\nIn order to ensure the protection of customer data, despite the challenge posed by the growing number of digitalised services, we are constantly developing our data management systems and respond promptly to any information received regarding data protection risks. During the year under report, we additionally im/uni00AD proved customer data protection by tightening customer data governance. If customers have any queries regarding the pro/uni00AD cessing of their personal data, they are welcome to contact the Customer Interaction Centre or the Data Protection Officer in their respective market.\n\nAt the same time, we work continuously to maintain our high level of data protection and regularly check all applications de/uni00AD ployed for processing customer data to ensure they comply with all currently applicable and appropriate IT security measures. Our specialised teams search specifically for weak points in applications. We also translate any new findings into binding, Group/uni00ADwide standards if the need arises.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group collaborates closely with the relevant data protection supervisory authorities, particularly regarding funda/uni00AD mental data protection issues such as the increasing connectiv/uni00AD ity of vehicles. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 3/uni00AD3, 418/uni00AD1\n\n## Secure connectivity\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's responsibility for its products includes the se/uni00AD cure transmission of vehicle data to third parties. For example, Group vehicles are not directly connected to the Internet, but communicate directly and exclusively with the BMW/uni00A0Connected/uni00AD Drive back/uni00ADend facilities via a secure connection within a virtual private network. The strategy enables the BMW/uni00A0Group to mini/uni00AD mise the risk of unauthorised third parties accessing either the vehicle itself or any of its sensitive data. The access point to the Internet is controlled via a gateway. We see this extended vehicle copytext approach in accordance with ISO 20078 as the best solution to providing outstanding data security and data pro/uni00AD tection and meeting statutory cybersecurity requirements (e.g. UN/uni00A0R155).\n\n/uni2197 CarData provides BMW and MINI customers with transparency and sovereignty over the transfer of data to authorised third par/uni00AD ties. With the introduction of the service in Germany and Europe in 2017 and the USA in 2020, the BMW/uni00A0Group is fully implement/uni00AD ing the current requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The BMW/uni00A0Group deploys state/uni00ADof/uni00ADthe/uni00ADart technologies to prevent vehicle theft. In the BMW iX * for example, ultra/uni00ADwide/uni00AD band technology further enhances the level of vehicle security./uni200A",

This point is par/uni00AD ticularly important in view of the increasing electrification of en/uni00AD tire fleets: although the strategy reduces the carbon emissions generated during the /uni2197 Use phase , at the same time, however, they increase, particularly in the supply chain, mainly due to the car/uni00AD bon/uni00ADintensive production of components such as high/uni00ADvoltage batteries. Reducing carbon emissions is therefore one of the key criteria we apply when awarding contracts to partners within our supplier network. Via this strategy, the BMW/uni00A0Group is simulta/uni00AD neously promoting cross/uni00ADsector decarbonisation, particularly for energy/uni00ADintensive primary materials such as steel, light metals and plastics. /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's ambitious decarbonisation targets are part of its integrated corporate target system. They are in line with the climate protection targets set out in the Paris Agreement and validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). These targets are being implemented under the responsibility of the Board of Management in the BMW/uni00A0Group's various departments and thus consistently throughout the organisation. /uni2197/uni00A0Performance indicators and management The BMW/uni00A0Group derives its specific de/uni00AD carbonisation targets for each vehicle project from its overarching goals. The responsibility for achieving these goals lies with de/uni00AD fined specialist units in the management areas of Development, Purchasing and Supplier Network as well as Production.

Among oth/uni00AD er factors, emissions targets at component level form the basis for the Group's carbon reduction measures. Target management and the monitoring of target achievement are performed at ve/uni00AD hicle level and subsequently aggregated for various purposes, including reporting at Group level.\n\nWe explain how the BMW/uni00A0Group manages the topic of sustain/uni00AD ability across the organisation in the chapter /uni2197 Strategy. We also report on the management of climate/uni00ADrelated opportunities and risks, such as the stricter regulation of carbon emissions, in the chapters /uni2197 Outlook and /uni2197 Risks and Opportunities.\n\n## Carbon reduction targets across the value chain in detail\n\nFor now, efforts to reduce the BMW/uni00A0Group's carbon emissions\n\nare based on measurable, science/uni00ADbased targets set to 2030. In this context, we joined the SBTi in 2020.\n\nWith these targets in mind, we are moving forward along a path/uni00AD way in line with the Paris Agreement set to limit global warming. On this basis, we also became the first German automobile man/uni00AD ufacturer to join the /uni2197 Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative of the SBTi in 2021. The BMW/uni00A0Group is therefore also part of the internation/uni00AD al /uni2197 Race to Zero Campaign initiated by the United Nations. With this strategy, we are also seeking to motivate other companies to take ambitious steps to protect the climate.\n\nWe have set ourselves the following SBTi/uni00ADvalidated carbon reduction targets\u00b9 by 2030 (base year 2019 for each scope):\n\n- - Carbon reduction by an average of 80 % per vehicle produced at our own plants and sites (Scope 1 and 2) 2 . These targets can be achieved by for example reducing our energy require/uni00AD ments and simultaneously increasing the use of renewable energy. 3 /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions at BMW/uni00A0Group sites\n- - Carbon reduction in the use phase/uni200A 4 of the vehicle (Scope 3 downstream/uni200A 5 ) by an average of more than 50 % per kilo/uni00AD metre driven. To accomplish this target, we are driving for/uni00AD ward the electrification of the entire product portfolio and deploying new, efficiency/uni00ADenhancing technologies.\n- /uni2197 Efficient Dynamics technologies\n- - Carbon reduction by more than 20 % on average/uni200A 6 per vehicle in the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream/uni200A 7 ). Thus we also have a scientifically tested and confirmed target for reducing car/uni00AD bon emissions in the supply chain. In particular, the use of renewable energy sources/uni200A 3 as a criterion for awarding con/uni00AD tracts to suppliers and a continuously rising secondary raw materials ratio will contribute to achieving the target.\n\n## /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions in the supply chain.\n\nOver the entire life cycle/uni200A 8 of a vehicle, the individual targets men/uni00AD tioned above will result in an average carbon reduction of more than 40 % by 2030. In order to achieve this, we rely on measures to reduce carbon emissions, such as the use of renewable ener/uni00AD gies /uni200A3 , in both our own operations and those of our suppliers. Accordingly, compensation measures are not included. In par/uni00AD ticular, the significant increase in the /uni2197/uni00A0sale of electrified vehicles , efficiency improvements in all drivetrain technologies and effec/uni00AD tive measures to /uni2197/uni00A0 reduce carbon emissions in the supply chain are expected to help achieve the targets. The BMW Group will con/uni00AD tinuously review and further develop its carbon reduction targets with the aim of continuing to meet its high standards for decarbonising its business model going forward.\n\nAbsolute carbon emissions decreased by 4.2/uni00A0% to around 117.4/uni00A0million tonnes during the year under report (2021: 122.5/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion tonnes), the main driver being the increasing electrification of the product portfolio.

The BMW/uni00A0Group aims not only to meet the statutory carbon emissions limits, but to under/uni00AD cut them. Within the EU\u00b9, average carbon fleet emissions, taking into account regulatory requirements\u00b2 and in accordance with WLTP\u00b3, were 105.0 g CO2/km/uni200A 4 . We have thus reduced the carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet EU/uni200A 5 by a further 10.9 g com/uni00AD pared to the previous year (2021: 115.9 g CO2/km/uni200A 4 ). We remained significantly below the limit of 127.5 g CO2/km/uni200A 4 applicable to the BMW/uni00A0Group in the year under report by 22.5 g CO2/km, continu/uni00AD ing the trend seen in recent decades, driven by the electrification of the vehicle fleet and the fleet/uni00ADwide deployment of innovative /uni2197/uni00A0Efficient Dynamics technologies . On this basis, we shall continue to work on reducing greenhouse gas emissions going forward.\n\nRegulatory GHG fleet consumption targets were met in the US market during the year under report. 6 In the USA, GHG fleet emis/uni00AD sions /uni200A7 averaged 137.3 g CO2/km for model year (MY) 2022 for the Passenger Cars category (MY 2021: 134.0 g CO2/km) and 154.9 g CO2/km (MY 2021: 150.1 g CO2/km) for the Light Truck category. Volume/uni00ADweighted fleet carbon emissions averaged 145.9 g CO2/ km in the USA (MY 2021: 140.9 g CO2/km). 8 Despite higher sales of all/uni00ADelectric vehicles in the US market, GHG fleet emissions increased slightly year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear, as significantly more vehicles from higher segments with correspondingly higher emissions were also sold during the year under report. In China, average fleet carbon emissions were 150.6 g CO2/km 9 in accordance with the WLTC test cycle (2021: 163.0 g CO2/km WLTC). Thus we also met the regulatory CAFC fleet consumption requirements appli/uni00AD cable in that country during the year under report. 10\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's worldwide carbon fleet emissions 11 averaged 193.7 g CO2/km 12 ( 2021: 197.9 g CO2/km) in the year under report. These figures correspond to a decrease of 11.4/uni00A0% compared to the base year 2019 (2019: 218.5 g CO2/km). When calculating the emissions figure, the BMW/uni00A0Group takes into account the average\n\ncarbon fleet emissions (including upstream emissions for fuel and electric charging) in the EU, the USA and China and stand/uni00AD ardises them in accordance with WLTP. With a share of more than 80 % of BMW/uni00A0Group deliveries, these three core markets and regions form a reliable basis for calculating global carbon fleet emissions.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is paying close attention to carbon emissions legislation in its various markets. Current developments during the year under report included the EU's agreement on new fleet emissions targets for the years 2030 and 2035 and the tighten/uni00AD ing of national fleet consumption targets in the USA. At state level, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CARB) also adopted a new Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 2022 that calls for a ZEV quota of 100 % by 2035, which is expected to be adopted by several states. In principle, the BMW/uni00A0Group supports the development of harmonized regula/uni00AD tions - both nationally and internationally. Comparable specifi/uni00AD cations in major markets create reliable, predictable framework conditions and make an important contribution to combating climate change as well as improving air quality. We provide information on the BMW/uni00A0Group's most important climate policy positions and activities in our /uni2197 Climate Commitment Report .\n\n## Making conventional drivetrains more efficient and generating fewer emissions\n\nFrom the BMW/uni00A0Group's point of view, modern, efficient combus/uni00AD tion engines also continue to play an important role. This per/uni00AD spective will continue to apply as long as unrestricted access to charging infrastructure cannot yet be guaranteed across all re/uni00AD gions and for every customer. For this reason, the BMW/uni00A0Group will continue to work on improving the efficiency of its conven/uni00AD tional drivetrain systems as part of its Efficient Dynamics strat/uni00AD egy. Efficient Dynamics is a technology package comprising various coordinated measures to reduce fuel consumption in the fields of engine technology, aerodynamics and lightweight con/uni00AD struction that has been in use across the fleet since 2007.\n\n## 5 /uni2197 Glossary",

        "page_content": "Products\n\nA key component in this respect is currently the extended use of 48/uni00ADvolt technology. 48/uni00ADvolt recuperation systems use the energy recovered from the braking process to supply the vehicle's elec/uni00AD trical system and generate additional propulsion. The technolo/uni00AD gy helps reduce fuel consumption and thus also carbon emis/uni00AD sions. In Europe, in addition to its all/uni00ADelectric models and plug/uni00ADin hybrids, we offer numerous new model series that feature a 48/uni00AD volt recuperation system. Since 2022, our modular engines have been fitted with the second, even more efficient, generation of 48/uni00ADvolt technology. The further development of energy manage/uni00AD ment in BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles, alongside other measures such as switching to highly efficient tyres, is designed to ensure  additional efficiency and optimised consumption figures.\n\n## Further reduction in pollutant emissions\n\nSince the early 1990s, the BMW/uni00A0Group has significantly reduced the regulated pollutant emissions of its vehicles, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) 1 by deploying new technologies and further developing existing ones. In Europe alone, we have reduced the relevant exhaust emissions of our new vehicle fleets for diesel/uni00ADpowered passenger cars in line with the limits of the Euro 1 to Euro 6d emissions standards by well over 90 % from 1992 to 2021 compared with levels measured prior to the introduction of the Euro emissions standards. All BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles offered during the year under report meet the current Euro 6d emissions standard applicable within the European Union as well as comparable regulations in Switzerland, Norway, the UK and Iceland.\n\nThe level of nitrogen oxides is a crucial factor for air quality in cities. For this reason, since mid/uni00AD2018 the BMW/uni00A0Group has been using a highly effective combination of NOx storage catalytic converters (NSC) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems that include urea injection (AdBlue) in all BMW vehicles as well as in the larger diesel/uni00ADpowered MINI models. The efficiency of exhaust gas aftertreatment has been further raised by the use of an improved oxidation catalytic converter in combination with a two/uni00ADstage SCR system. This new technology has been availa/uni00AD ble since 2020 with the revised generation of 6/uni00ADcylinder diesel\n\nengines and will be rolled out across the entire product portfolio in the coming years. There have already been signs of a reduction in NOx pollution in German cities over the last few years. Apart from various measures taken to reduce pollutants, the ongoing renewal of the vehicle fleets of all automobile manufacturers has also contributed to the improvement. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI/uni00ADIndex: 305/uni00AD7\n\n## ELECTROMOBILITY\n\nElectric mobility is among the major topics driving the ongoing transformation in the automotive industry. The BMW/uni00A0Group is systematically continuing to electrify its model range as a key component of its product strategy. Our electrified vehicles are playing a major role in reducing fleet emissions and thus achiev/uni00AD ing our ambitious strategic /uni2197/uni00A0carbon reduction targets./uni200A\n\n## Growing demand for electrified vehicles\n\nWith our constantly expanding range of all/uni00ADelectric, battery/uni00ADpow/uni00AD ered vehicles (BEV/uni200A 2 ) and plug/uni00ADin hybrid models (PHEV/uni200A 3 ), we are serving a rapidly growing demand. In 2022, the BMW Group de/uni00AD livered a total of 433,792/uni200A 4 units to customers, i.e. significantly more electrified vehicles than in the previous year (2021: 328,314/uni200A 4 units; +/uni00A032.1/uni00A0%). On this basis, the share of electrified vehicles had also increased significantly to 18.1 % by the end of the year under report (2021: 13.0 %). To date, the BMW/uni00A0Group has there/uni00AD fore handed over a total of more than 1.4 million vehicles with either all/uni00ADelectric or plug/uni00ADin hybrid drive systems to customers.\n\n## /uni2197 Automotive segment\n\nThe share of electrified vehicles in total deliveries might exceed 30 % by as early as 2025. In our view, the /uni2197/uni00A0NEUE KLASSE has the potential to additionally accelerate the market penetration of elec/uni00AD tric mobility, and thus a 50 % share of all/uni00ADelectric vehicles in the BMW/uni00A0Group's global unit sales could be achieved even earlier than 2030. Under these conditions, the BMW/uni00A0Group aims to sur/uni00AD pass the mark of ten million all/uni00ADelectric vehicles delivered to cus/uni00AD tomers in total by 2030. This positive expectation for future sales\n\n5\n\nwill also play a key role in the review of our carbon emissions reduction targets scheduled to take place in 2023.\n\n/uni2197 Carbon emissions reduction targets across the value chain in detail\n\nBoth the MINI and the Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brands are also firmly on track towards an electrified future. Based on their respective typical user profiles, the model ranges of the two brands are set to be exclusively all/uni00ADelectric by the early 2030s.",

        "page_content": "Products\n\n## Model range consistently focused on customer needs\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's product range not only serves the growing demand for electrified models, but also reflects varying frame/uni00AD work conditions and customer needs in its individual markets. Our customers can therefore continue to choose between all/uni00ADelectric vehicles, plug/uni00ADin hybrids and efficient internal com/uni00AD bustion engines. We make this customer/uni00ADoriented offering pos/uni00AD sible by means of our /uni2197 flexible production systems and the scalable modular system of our vehicles. The diversity of the range is embodied in particular by the BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW 3 and 4 Series and BMW 7 Series models, each of which is available with all three types of drivetrain. This will also apply to the BMW 5 Series as of 2023.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, the BMW/uni00A0Group had a total of 12 BEV motor variants in eight different models available to order. New additions include the BMW i7/uni200A 1 , the BMW iX1/uni200A 1 and the ex/uni00AD tended/uni00ADwheelbase version of the BMW 3 Series for the Chinese market, deliveries of which began in 2022. The existing, all/uni00ADelec/uni00AD tric product portfolio will be expanded to include the BMW iX3/uni200A 1 , BMW i4/uni200A 1 , BMW iX/uni200A 1 and the MINI Cooper SE/uni200A 1 . The inclusion of these variants in the range means that at least one all/uni00ADelectric model will be available in each of the high/uni00ADyield model series. Over the next two years, vehicles such as the BMW i5 and the all/uni00ADelectric variant of the MINI Countryman are set to follow. As of 2025, the Group will take its core BMW brand into a new, consistently all/uni00ADelectric dimension with the /uni2197 NEUE KLASSE.\n\nMoreover, in the course of 2022, the BMW/uni00A0Group either launched or revised seven different PHEV engine variants. At the end of 2022, a total of 19 PHEV engine variants/uni200A 1 in a total of 13 models were available to order worldwide. With offers such as the BMW eDrive Zone, attractive electricity tariffs for driving, charging equipment and increased ranges, we are helping drivers of plug/uni00ADin hybrids to drive electrically as frequently and over as long a distance as possible. For instance, the BMW 2 Series Active Tourer Plug/uni00ADin Hybrid/uni200A 1 from the compact segment can cover up to 93 kilometres (WLTP/uni200A 2 ) solely on battery power.\n\n## Increasing range in line with customer needs\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group assesses the increase in the electric ranges of its vehicles from various points of view. Basically, we are not aiming to achieve the greatest technically possible range across all vehicle segments, but see it as important to optimally adapt ranges to the intended use of the respective vehicle. At the same time, we also take into account the environmental impact, as greater range also means deploying larger and therefore heavi/uni00AD er high/uni00ADvoltage batteries. This relationship has a direct effect on resource consumption, the environmental footprint of the supply chain and, of course, vehicle weight, which in turn has a signifi/uni00AD cant impact on electricity consumption.\n\nWith these points in mind, the MINI Cooper SE/uni200A 1 has a range of more than 200 kilometres (WLTP/uni200A 2 ), which is fully in line with customer requirements for urban areas. On the other hand, the BMW iX/uni200A 1 , the BMW/uni00A0i4/uni200A 1 and the BMW i7/uni200A 1 are designed to cover long distances of around 600 kilometres (WLTP/uni200A 2 ) on one charge.\n\n## Thinking holistically about electric mobility\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's electrified vehicles are characterised by high efficiency and thus low consumption when driving. However, the BMW/uni00A0 Group has greater aspirations: its vehicles need to be as eco/uni00ADfriendly as possible, not only during their locally carbon/uni00ADfree use phase, but also in terms of their overall footprint, including the supply chain and production. /uni2197 CO2 steering With battery/uni00ADpow/uni00AD ered automobiles in particular, the environmental impacts are predominantly in the upstream value chain, where the purchase of raw materials to make battery cells and the carbon/uni00ADintensive production of batteries have a significant impact.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group therefore attributes great importance to includ/uni00AD ing environmental and social aspects when producing compo/uni00AD nents such as electric motors, high/uni00ADvoltage storage units and battery cells. /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions in the supply chain /uni2197/uni00A0Social and eco/uni00AD logical   responsibility Other approaches to mitigating the environ/uni00AD mental impacts include recycling and reusing high/uni00ADvoltage stor/uni00AD age units from our BEV and PHEV models. The BMW/uni00A0Group\n\nalready offers all customers who purchase its battery/uni00ADpowered vehicles the opportunity to take back their high/uni00ADvoltage batteries free of charge.\n\n## Expanding charging infrastructure and enabling faster charging\n\nAn expanded, customer/uni00ADfriendly charging infrastructure will pave the way for the rapid and widespread use of electric mobility. This relationship is supported, for example, by market data collected within the EU - both at the level of member states and in a com/uni00AD parison of different regions. A prerequisite for the swift develop/uni00AD ment of an efficient charging infrastructure is a high level of will/uni00AD ingness on the part of all stakeholders. This applies in particular to the expansion of charging and hydrogen refuelling infrastruc/uni00AD ture within the EU - a key factor in achieving the ambitious fleet carbon reduction targets adopted in 2022. The BMW/uni00A0Group con/uni00AD tinues to advocate for standardised framework conditions and creates offers that enable customer/uni00ADfriendly charging on a broad basis.",

Customers can access a large number of public charging points via their BMW or MINI Charging Card and the My BMW or/uni00A0 MINI App. Digital Charging Services GmbH (DCS) provides broad/uni00A0access to various charging networks throughout Europe. As a joint venture of the BMW/uni00A0Group, the Mercedes/uni00ADBenz Group and bp, DCS is among Europe's leading providers of digital charging solutions.\n\nA total of almost 900,000 charging points is available to BMW and MINI customers worldwide. In Europe alone, BMW custom/uni00AD ers have easy access to a network with over 360,000 charging points, including fast/uni00ADcharging stations with a capacity of up to 350 kilowatts (kW). These are all part of IONITY's European high/uni00ADpower charging services initiated by the BMW/uni00A0Group, which can be used via BMW and MINI Charging. IONITY currently op/uni00AD erates 430 stations with 1,900 charging points in a total of 24 countries, which are publicly accessible, brand/uni00ADindependent and designed in accordance with the European Combined Charging System (CCS) charging standard. Furthermore, they are all pow/uni00AD ered by 100 % green electricity.\n\nBeyond the public charging service, BMW and MINI Charging provide a standard charging solution both for homes and on the road in the form of the Flexible Fast Charger and other charging products. We also offer charging solutions for corporate custom/uni00AD ers in cooperation with our partners. The BMW/uni00A0Group itself op/uni00AD erates one of the largest company charging networks in Germany.\n\n## Digital, innovative and more eco/uni00ADfriendly charging solutions\n\nCharging should be as easy as conventional refuelling and we are working on digital solutions in particular to meet this demand. These include Connected Charging - an application that can be accessed from the vehicle as well as via an app. Via the service, drivers not only receive up/uni00ADto/uni00ADdate charging information, since 2022 they have also been able to control the charging process at the touch of a button. The eRoute function also enables cus/uni00AD tomers to plan their charging stops on long/uni00ADdistance trips. In the course of 2023, the first BMW models will also be equipped with a Plug&Charge function, in which both authentication and billing will be done automatically by connecting the vehicle to the charg/uni00AD ing system. Using the so/uni00ADcalled multi/uni00ADcontract functionality, in/uni00AD dividual driving electricity tariff contracts from various providers can also be stored digitally within the vehicle to facilitate the use of charging stations from different operators.\n\nWe also promote the use of renewable energy. Since 2022, for each charging process conducted via BMW and MINI Charging, the equivalent amount of energy consumed is fed into the pow/uni00AD er grid as green electricity, which is certified via Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) as recognised proofs of origin. Moreover, we are continuously working on integrating electric vehicles with their high/uni00ADvoltage storage systems in the energy grid. /uni2197/uni00A0Vehicles as part of the power grid\n\n## Advancing hydrogen technology\n\nCustomer/uni00ADoriented technological diversity also includes the fur/uni00AD ther development of fuel cell technology. Depending on the seg/uni00AD ment, we see hydrogen/uni00ADpowered electric vehicles as an impor/uni00AD tant complement to electric mobility with batteries and thus as an opportunity to reduce carbon emissions even more quickly. Following the presentation of the first /uni2197/uni00A0BMW iX5 Hydrogen at the IAA Mobility in 2021, at the end of August 2022 we began pro/uni00AD ducing fuel cells for a pilot fleet of these vehicles. In December, this was followed by the start of production of these vehicles at the pilot plant of the Research and Innovation Centre in Munich.\n\nWe are also driving hydrogen technology forward at a higher lev/uni00AD el and thus are involved in global organisations and associations such as the /uni2197 Hydrogen Council. As an associated partner of /uni2197/uni00A0H2/uni00A0Mobility Deutschland GmbH , the BMW/uni00A0Group is supporting the development of hydrogen infrastructure in Germany.

With the start of production of the BMW iX1 * in Regensburg, the BMW/uni00A0Group achieved its aim of producing at least one all/uni00ADelectric model at each of its German vehicle plants by 2022. Moreover, the first BMW i7 * was manufactured at the BMW Group's Dingolfing plant. Production also began in Lydia, an extension of the BMW Brilliance plant in Tiexi, China, where the all/uni00ADelectric long/uni00ADwheelbase version of the BMW 3 Series is being manufac/uni00AD tured for the Chinese market.\n\nWe produce units with electrified drivetrains in our production network at 13 /uni2197/uni00A0 locations worldwide. Fully electric units roll off the/uni00A0production line in Dingolfing, Leipzig, Munich, Regensburg, Oxford and Shenyang. As of 2025, the /uni2197/uni00A0NEUE KLASSE will also feature a vehicle architecture systematically geared to suit elec/uni00AD tric drive systems. The vehicle is due to be manufactured initial/uni00AD ly at the new Debrecen plant in Hungary as well as in Munich as of 2026. We aim to gradually transfer the new vehicle architecture to the global production network in the years that follow. It also plans to produce all/uni00ADelectric vehicles at the plant in Spartanburg (USA) and at least six all/uni00ADelectric X models are scheduled to be manufactured there by 2030.\n\n## Integrated component production for electrified vehicles\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's production network also manufactures the systems required for the electric drivetrain. The competence centre for e/uni00ADdrive production in Dingolfing plays a leading role in this respect, as battery modules, high/uni00ADvoltage batteries and fifth/uni00ADgeneration electric motors are all produced at the site. High/uni00ADvoltage batteries and their components are also made at BMW Group production plants in Leipzig and Regensburg, as well as in Spartanburg (USA) and Shenyang (China).\n\nAt the same time, the Group is preparing its network to produce the next generation of electric drivetrains. The Steyr engine man/uni00AD ufacturing plant in Austria is also being expanded to develop and produce the BMW Group's sixth generation of e/uni00ADdrive systems\n\n- * /uni2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.",

The next generation of high/uni00ADvoltage batter/uni00AD ies will be assembled nearby the plant. A new assembly centre for high/uni00ADvoltage batteries is also due to be established close to/uni00A0 the Spartanburg plant for this purpose. A corresponding announcement concerning the Debrecen plant in Hungary was made in 2022.\n\nThe Cell Manufacturing Competence Centre (CMCC) in Parsdorf near Munich, which went into operation in 2022, is making a vital contribution to the next generation of e/uni00ADdrive systems. Starting with the pilot production line in Parsdorf, the BMW/uni00A0Group intends to continue optimising the manufacturing processes of battery cells in terms of quality, performance and costs. The CMCC com/uni00AD plements the Battery Cell Competence Centre in Munich, which focuses primarily on the battery cell as a product.\n\n## Production sites in key markets\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group always aims to strike a good balance between production and deliveries in the various regions of the world where it operates. Group plants in Europe, South Africa, the USA and Mexico serve the global market. The BMW Brilliance plants in China mainly manufacture for the local market. During the year under report, expansion and extension measures were complet/uni00AD ed at the Chinese plants and further models integrated in our production processes. The BMW/uni00A0Group's automotive partner plants in Jakarta (Indonesia), Cairo (Egypt), Kulim (Malaysia) and, since 2022, Chu Lai (Vietnam) primarily serve their respective regional markets, producing both BMW and MINI brand models. The same applies to the BMW/uni00A0Group plants in Araquari (Brazil), Rayong (Thailand) and Chennai (India). The Group also awards contracts for the series production of automobiles and motorcy/uni00AD cles to external partners (contract manufacturers). During the year under report, Magna Steyr Fahrzeugtechnik produced the BMW 5 Series Sedan and the BMW Z4* in Graz (Austria). VDL Nedcar in Born (the Netherlands) manufactured the MINI Con/uni00AD vertible and the MINI Countryman as well as the BMW X1 until summer 2022.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group manufactures BMW motorcycles and scooters at its Berlin plant as well as at two international locations in Manaus (Brazil) and Rayong (Thailand). BMW motorcycles and scooters are also produced by the partner companies TVS Motor Company in Hosur (India) and Loncin Motor Co., Ltd in Chongqing (China).\n\nThe BMW Group's production network also includes engine plants in Hams Hall (UK), Munich (Germany), Steyr (Austria) and Shenyang (China), as well as component plants at sites in Eisenach, Landshut and Wackersdorf (Germany) and Swindon (UK). The production network thus comprises a total of 31 plants in 15 countries.\n\n## BMW/uni00A0Group vehicle plants\n\n| Location                                              | Country      | Production programme 2022                                                                                                       | Electrification portfolio   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Araquari                                              | Brazil       | BMW 3 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X4                                                                                            |                             |\n| Berlin                                                | Germany      | BMW motorcycles                                                                                                                 | BEV                         |\n| Chennai                                               | India        | BMW 2 Series, BMW 3 Series, BMW 5 Series, BMW 6  Series, BMW 7 Series, BMW X1, BMW X3, BMW X4,  BMW X5, BMW X7, MINI Countryman |                             |\n| Dingolfing                                            | Germany      | BMW 4 Series, BMW 5 Series, BMW 6 Series, BMW 7  Series, BMW 8 Series, BMW M, BMW i7 * , BMW iX *                               | BEV, PHEV                   |\n| Leipzig                                               | Germany      | BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series, BMW i3                                                                                              | BEV, PHEV                   |\n| Manaus                                                | Brazil       | BMW motorcycles                                                                                                                 |                             |\n| Munich                                                | Germany      | BMW 3 Series, BMW 4 Series, BMW i4 * , BMW M                                                                                    | BEV, PHEV                   |\n| Oxford                                                | UK           | MINI, MINI Clubman, MINI Cooper SE *                                                                                            | BEV                         |\n| Rayong                                                | Thailand     | BMW 2 Series, BMW 3 Series, BMW 5 Series, BMW 7  Series, BMW  X1, BMW X3, BMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7                                | PHEV                        |\n| Regensburg                                            | Germany      | BMW 1 Series, BMW 2 Series, BMW X1, BMW iX1 * ,  BMW X2                                                                         | BEV, PHEV                   |\n| Rosslyn                                               | South Africa | BMW X3                                                                                                                          |                             |\n| San Luis Potos\u00ed                                       | Mexico       | BMW 2 Series, BMW 3 Series, BMW M                                                                                               | PHEV                        |\n| Spartanburg                                           | USA          | BMW X3, BMW X4, BMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7, BMW  XM * , BMW M                                                                       | PHEV                        |\n| Rolls/uni00ADRoyce Manufacturing Plant, Goodwood,  UK | UK           | Rolls/uni00ADRoyce Cullinan * , Dawn * , Ghost * , Phantom * ,  Wraith *                                                        | BEV from 2023               |\n\n- * /uni2197 Consumption and Carbon Disclosures.",

The circularity approach re/uni00AD quires a holistic strategy - beginning at the product design stage and including the broader use of secondary materials in the sup/uni00AD ply chain as well as the recycling of end/uni00ADof/uni00ADlife vehicles. The strategy also reduces dependence on primary raw materials at the same time. At all levels of in/uni00ADhouse production, we remain committed to systematically conserving resources, continuously improving  energy  efficiency  and  further  reducing  carbon emissions.\n\n## Closing material cycles\n\nIn order to reduce the use of primary materials in the automotive value chain, the BMW/uni00A0Group endeavours to close cycles within the production chain and therefore returns selected production residues to its suppliers of material. The recovery of essential groups of materials at the end of a product's life cycle can be significantly increased by focusing on recycling/uni00ADcompatible con/uni00AD cepts at the development stage, thereby enabling materials to be recovered and recycled for use in new production processes. Going forward, the cobalt, lithium and nickel used by cell manu/uni00AD facturers to produce battery cells for the BMW/uni00A0Group's /uni2197/uni00A0NEUE KLASSE will include a proportion of secondary materials. This approach reduces the need for primary materials and thus/uni00A0the sourcing of potentially critical raw materials.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0Average distribution of materials in BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles\n\nAlready today, BMW/uni00A0Group vehicles are manufactured to a cer/uni00AD tain extent from recycled and reused materials. In line with the ' Secondary First' approach, we aim to maximise the use of sec/uni00AD ondary materials going forward, taking both technical  feasibility and availability into account. For this reason, within the frame/uni00AD work of selected product, material and supplier requirements, we clearly specify that secondary materials will be  given preference in future vehicles. The BMW i Vision Circular is symbolic of our ambitions in this respect, by showing that it is possible to build a vehicle entirely out of recycled or renewable raw materials.\n\nWe encourage the return of end/uni00ADof/uni00ADlife vehicles, components and materials for reuse as a secondary source of raw materials in order to drive the circular economy. Together with its national sales companies, the BMW/uni00A0Group has already organised the return of end/uni00ADof/uni00ADlife vehicles in 30 countries and offers environ/uni00AD mentally friendly recycling at more than 2,800 points of return. /uni2197 GRI Index: 301/uni00AD3, 301/uni00AD3, /uni2197 SASB Index\n\nSecondary materials also generate fewer carbon emissions com/uni00AD pared with primary materials - for example, in the amount of up to 80/uni00A0% for aluminium and up to 70/uni00A0% for steel. * At the same time, this strategy avoids the need to extract natural resources and critical raw materials. The circularity principle therefore also contributes to a more effective mitigation of the risks associated with the extraction of primary materials, ranging from potential availability issues in light of market or political developments through to risks connected with environmental and social stand/uni00AD ards.\n\n## /uni2197/uni00A0Purchasing and supplier network\n\nAny secondary materials used by the BMW/uni00A0Group must meet the same high standards as primary materials in terms of quality, safety and reliability./uni200A /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 3/uni00AD3 /uni200A\n\n## Closed material cycle for nickel, lithium and cobalt in China\n\nFor the first time, the BMW/uni00A0Group is currently setting up a closed cycle in China with the aim of reusing the raw mate/uni00AD rials nickel, lithium and cobalt from end/uni00ADof/uni00ADlife high/uni00ADvolt/uni00AD age batteries. The batteries originate primarily from fully and partially electrified development vehicles, test facil/uni00AD ities, production scrap and are reused in forklifts. In the long term, the BMW/uni00A0 Group also plans to reuse batteries from end/uni00ADof/uni00ADlife vehicles. In this context, the BMW/uni00A0Group is working together with a local recycling company that dismantles the batteries and recovers a high percentage of the raw materials from the battery cells using an in/uni00AD novative technology. These secondary raw materials are intended to be used to produce new battery cells for the BMW/uni00A0Group.",

For ex/uni00AD ample, through BMW i Ventures, we have held a stake in the US start/uni00ADup Lilac Solutions since 2021. Lilac Solutions is pursuing the goal of extracting lithium from the brine of saltwater deposits using ion exchangers in a far more eco/uni00AD and resource/uni00ADfriendly way than previously possible. During the period under report, we continued to invest in the resource/uni00ADconserving extraction of lithium by acquiring a stake in the company Mangrove Lithium. Its innovative technology makes it possible to refine and process both virgin and recycled lithium directly into battery/uni00ADgrade lithium using a special procedure. An additional focus of our investments via BMW i Ventures is on an innovative process for carbon/uni00ADfree steel production developed by US start/uni00ADup Boston Metal.\n\n## Resource management at all BMW Group sites\n\nResource efficiency and the control of the use of resources in general are integral parts of the environmental management system in place across the BMW/uni00A0Group's global production net/uni00AD work. Alongside /uni2197/uni00A0 carbon emissions , the other key variables are /uni2197/uni00A0 energy and /uni2197/uni00A0 potable water consumption , the volume of /uni2197/uni00A0 waste generated and the use of /uni2197/uni00A0VOC solvents . The BMW/uni00A0Group intends to reduce its energy and potable water consumption, waste for disposal, and the amount of solvents used per vehicle produced by 25/uni00A0% in each category by 2030 (base year 2016).\n\nA steering committee manages the international environmental protection network within the BMW/uni00A0Group. Each separate facil/uni00AD ity, area and building is assigned to an internal operator who is responsible for the technical systems in their area and the smooth running of processes and workflows as well as their environmental  impact. 1\n\nA certified environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 has been implemented at all BMW/uni00A0Group pro/uni00AD duction sites. Moreover, all German and Austrian sites are certi/uni00AD fied under the EMAS environmental management system. The BMW/uni00A0Group coordinates its environmental protection measures covering the areas Emissions, Water, Waste, Training/Qualifica/uni00AD tions and Environmental Management System in a total of five competence centres located worldwide. Environmental improve/uni00AD ments that have proven effective at one location are then imple/uni00AD mented at other locations to the extent possible. Continuous further training and the exchange of experience within the work/uni00AD force ensure that relevant knowledge is transferred and that learnings are applied throughout the organisation. In the year under report, our environmental management system again made a major contribution to ensuring that there were no signif/uni00AD icant environmental incidents involving the payment of fines throughout the production network.\n\n## Water\n\nIn terms of water consumption in production, the BMW/uni00A0Group aims to continuously optimise the circulation systems at its plants, for example by expanding the purification stages in wastewater treatment at the Leipzig plant. The /uni2197/uni00A0specific potable water/uni200A consumption /uni200A 2/uni200A, 3, 4 /uni200A of the automobile production at 1.90/uni00A0m 3 per vehicle produced is almost on the same level as the prevoius year (2021: 1.91/uni00A0m 3 ).\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0Water consumption in detail\n\n## Waste\n\nIn its efforts to reduce the total volume of waste, the BMW/uni00A0Group uses recycling and preparation concepts that are adapted to the specific waste streams at its various plants as well as to region/uni00AD ally applicable statutory regulations and locally available waste management structures. In 2022, a total of 99.3/uni00A0% /uni200A5 (2021: 99.2/uni00A0%) of the waste generated by production was either recycled or recovered. The BMW Group was able to reduce the proportion of /uni2197/uni00A0 waste for disposal per vehicle produced/uni200A 6 by a solid 5.5/uni00A0% to 2.74/uni00A0kg compared with the previous year (2021: 2.90/uni00A0kg). We in/uni00AD tend to maintain this high level of recycling and recovery at its\n\nplants in the course of gradually transitioning to electric mobility. With this goal in mind, we are currently in the process of integrat/uni00AD ing any newly identified waste streams in our recycling and pro/uni00AD cessing systems.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 306/uni00AD4, 306/uni00AD5 /uni2197/uni00A0Waste generation in detail /uni2197/uni00A0SASB Index\n\n## VOC solvent emissions\n\nThe BMW Group cut its /uni2197/uni00A0VOC solvent emissions per vehicle  produced /uni200A7,/uni200A8 significantly by 12.9/uni00A0% to 0.61/uni00A0kg (2021: 0.70 kg) during the year under report.

As part of this strategy, we endeavour to minimise any potentially negative impacts caused by its production and con/uni00AD struction activities. In addition, after analysing biodiversity with the help of relevant biodiversity indicators, we identify targeted measures with a view to creating natural habitats at selected sites or when planning the construction of any new buildings. With this strategy, we want not only to help preserve, but also to improve on biodiversity in and around our sites. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 304/uni00AD2 /uni200A\n\n## Energy use and carbon emissions\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group intends to reduce carbon emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) at all the locations of the BMW/uni00A0Group by a further 80 % on average per vehicle produced in comparison to 2019 by 2030. Production accounts for the majority of the BMW Group's /uni2197/uni00A0Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions . In order to reduce emissions, we remain committed to a combined approach of implementing ad/uni00AD ditional energy efficiency measures, increasing the volume of in/uni00ADhouse electricity generated from renewable sources, buying in green electricity from direct supply contracts and using certifi/uni00AD cates of origin.\n\nThe remaining emissions are largely attributable to the use of natural gas. In this respect, the BMW Group faces the challenge of replacing natural gas with non/uni00ADfossil energy sources such as biogas, green hydrogen or green electricity. However, the phys/uni00AD ical availability of alternative energy sources, the retrofitting of the technical systems and political framework conditions largely define the speed of the transition.\n\nSince 2021, the BMW Group has made the remaining carbon emissions generated at its own plants and sites completely car/uni00AD bon/uni00ADneutral by balance sheet through the use of voluntary com/uni00AD pensation certificates. 1 /uni2197/uni00A0Compensation of site/uni00ADrelated carbon emissions\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group continuously invests in improving the energy efficiency of its worldwide production network.

In this context, clear roles - in each case with corresponding responsibilities, targets and re/uni00AD porting obligations - are assigned to central strategy depart/uni00AD ments, regional management units and plants at local level.\n\nIn response to the ongoing tight supply situation for semicon/uni00AD ductor components, restrictions due to the coronavirus pandem/uni00AD ic and the impact of the war in Ukraine, production at BMW Group plants had to be repeatedly adjusted during the year under report. As a result, production volumes and therefore absolute energy consumption decreased slightly year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear. In conjunction with the transformation towards electric mobility, sites are being and have been modified, expanded and newly developed, such as the Lydia plant in China in 2022. /uni2197/uni00A0 Energy consumption in detail, /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 302/uni00AD1, 302/uni00AD4\n\nThe amount of energy used specifically for vehicle production increased slightly to 2.13 MWh per vehicle (2021: 2.10 MWh; + 1.4/uni00A0 %). In absolute terms, energy consumption decreased slightly year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear to 6,295,990 MWh (2021: 6,476,955 MWh; - 2.8 %).\n\n## Renewable energy\n\nWorldwide, all Group production sites/uni200A 5 and the majority of its other sites use electricity derived from renewable sources via in/uni00ADhouse generation, direct procurement or Energy Attribute Certificates (e.g. certificates of origin).\n\nAt present, the BMW/uni00A0Group is unable to entirely cover its energy needs by generating its own renewable energy and therefore purchases additional electricity from other renewable sources.

The cost drivers for the BMW/uni00A0Group's Purchasing team were primarily the price hikes seen for raw ma/uni00AD terials, semiconductors, energy and transportation coupled with a challenging supply situation. The combined impact of supply bottlenecks for semiconductor components, the temporarily restricted availability of wire harnesses owing to the war in Ukraine, and pandemic/uni00ADrelated lockdowns in China led to pro/uni00AD duction interruptions worldwide, particularly in the first half of the year. Although the situation eased slightly during the second six/uni00AD month period, global supply chains remained in a fragile state. /uni2197 Outlook , /uni2197 Risks and opportunities\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group follows the principle of procuring vehicle com/uni00AD ponents close to its production sites to the extent possible and is therefore represented by local teams in all its key purchasing markets, in order to identify risks promptly and respond flexibly to the respective market circumstances. In the face of geostra/uni00AD tegic aspects, a resilient strategy for the Group's supply chains is also becoming increasingly important and the BMW/uni00A0Group takes this fact into account when selecting its  partners.\n\n## In/uni00ADhouse production: a competitive advantage\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group regularly examines its range of products in terms of their profitability and strategic importance. A special focus is currently on e/uni00ADmobility. In this central area of transfor/uni00AD mation, the BMW/uni00A0Group is building up its own skill sets in stra/uni00AD tegically important components, particularly in areas where tech/uni00AD nology is not competitively available on the market. The in/uni00ADhouse production of certain key components also helps us to improve the level of supply security and thus gain a competitive advan/uni00AD tage. At the same time, we are looking to strengthen our pro/uni00AD cess/uni00ADrelated expertise in technologies relevant for quality man/uni00AD agement  within the supplier network.\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nQuality is a vital competitive factor and of key importance for ensuring customer satisfaction.

There are signs of increasing competition for the raw materials required to drive forward electric mobility. With the help of measures such as the direct purchase of lithium and cobalt, the BMW/uni00A0Group is making itself technologically and regionally less dependent on individual deposits and suppliers. Direct purchasing in Australia, Argentina and Morocco underpin our dual intention of securing raw material supplies, whilst also maintaining our high sustain/uni00AD ability standards, particularly in supply chains involving critical raw materials.

The BMW/uni00A0Group Supplier Code of Conduct also requires Tier/uni00AD1 suppliers to demand minimum standards within their sub/uni00ADsupplier chains.\n\nAnnual risk analyses regarding the BMW Group's sustainability standards are the starting point for raw materials/uni00ADrelated hedg/uni00AD ing activities that are designed to reduce environmental and human rights risks. Key levers in this respect are to forgo, sub/uni00AD stitute or reduce the use of primary risk raw materials. We also focus in particular on cooperating closely with our partners in the supplier network as well as in multi/uni00ADstakeholder initiatives and projects. We use scientific findings to gain an even better under/uni00AD standing of the raw material extraction process and to take it into account accordingly when analysing the level of risk in order to further reduce any negative impacts.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group places a particular focus on so/uni00ADcalled 'conflict minerals' and uses standardised Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) tools to ensure that the raw materials deployed can be traced back to the smelter. It uses existing certifications to ensure the origin of other raw materials. The BMW/uni00A0Group is also involved in developing certified standards for critical stages of the value chain, for example as part of the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), and subsequently applies them. Further de/uni00AD tails and raw materials profiles are available /uni2197 online . /uni2197 SASB Index\n\nMoreover, the BMW Group has set itself the goal of generating a positive impact for selected raw materials through our involve/uni00AD ment in local development projects.

We have therefore concluded agreements with our partners that guarantee annual production capacities of 40 GWh in Europe, 40 GWh in China and 30 GWh in the USA. Via this strategy, the Company is reinforcing its 'local for local' approach by sourcing battery cells regionally where our production facilities are located. The BMW/uni00A0Group will also use secondary raw mate/uni00AD rials to replace the primary raw materials cobalt, lithium and nickel in the new generation of battery cells and purchase green electricity in order to further reduce the size of our carbon foot/uni00AD print in the supply chain. /uni2197/uni00A0Carbon emissions in the supply chain\n\n## Supply security\n\nTo cushion the impact of the ongoing war in Ukraine on our European plants, the BMW Group has introduced a comprehen/uni00AD sive raft of measures with its partners and therefore continues to source components from western Ukraine. At the same time, our partners have established additional production sites outside Ukraine and the supply of wiring harnesses to our plants has returned to normal as a result.\n\nLockdowns in China designed to contain the coronavirus pan/uni00AD demic kept supply chains on tenterhooks, not to mention the challenging supply situation for semiconductors. In an effort to mitigate the worldwide shortage of semiconductors, among  other measures the BMW/uni00A0Group has entered into supply agreements involving increased levels of buffer stock when placing orders, as well as the direct purchase of strategically important semicon/uni00AD ductors.\n\n## Risk management in purchasing\n\nAn interconnected risk management system is fundamental for managing the supplier network. With this point in mind, the Company has established a RiskHub that analyses information from external, publicly available data sources with regard to potential risks such as natural disasters or financial risks. We also/uni00A0employ state/uni00ADof/uni00ADthe/uni00ADart methods derived from the fields of AI and big data analytics.

The RiskHub is subject to continuous improvement.\n\nIn order to avoid cyber risks and provide adequate protection, we analyse the entire value chain. The BMW Group expects its part/uni00AD ners to provide evidence of a preventive and responsive level of security. We require our partners to provide information security certificates in accordance with the TISAX automotive standard, and monitor their implementation. Collaborative IT security anal/uni00AD yses and a constant exchange of information additionally bolster resilience in the supplier network. The awareness of cyber risks is raised internally through training and information campaigns. Externally, the BMW/uni00A0Group supports its business partners with a regular flow of information.\n\n## Innovations\n\nCooperation in the supplier network based on trust and the de/uni00AD velopment of new partnerships is essential for us when it comes to swiftly deploying innovations in the products on offer. In this context, we work closely with the /uni2197 BMW Startup Garage and /uni2197 BMW i Ventures. At Newcomer Day 2022, selected start/uni00ADups presented a broad range of future technologies - including our new partner for innovative natural fibre composite solutions.\n\nThe highly innovative achievements of start/uni00ADups are also  reflected in the /uni2197 BMW Supplier Innovation Award.

Against the backdrop of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferket/uni00AD tensorgfaltspflichtengesetz), the BMW Group continued to de/uni00AD velop its well/uni00ADestablished processes during the year under report. The BMW/uni00A0Group's requirements and the expectations it places on its suppliers are set out in the /uni2197/uni00A0BMW/uni00A0Group Supplier Code of Con/uni00AD duct . /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD23, 3/uni00AD3, 407/uni00AD1, 408/uni00AD1\n\nA multi/uni00ADstage due diligence process has been established across all relevant areas of the organisation to delineate our responsi/uni00AD bility for the supplier network. A comprehensive description of the due diligence process can be found/uni00A0 /uni2197 online .\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is committed to the application of standardised procedures and a cooperative approach with a view to imple/uni00AD menting the due diligence obligations that are integrated in its business processes and avoiding redundant activities. For this reason, we engage in the Sector Dialogue Automotive Industry initiative, for example to develop guidelines for action and create an industry/uni00ADwide grievance mechanism.\n\n## -Risk analysis\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group monitors and assesses sustainability and human rights risks in its supplier network, including its busi/uni00AD ness relationships with both potential and active supplier locations. Among other strategies, we use risk filters and media analyses to identify abstract environmental and hu/uni00AD man rights risks, as well as standardised sustainability ques/uni00AD tionnaires and audits to conduct specific risk analysis at our Tier/uni00AD1 suppliers. Supply chain mapping forms the basis for analysing risks at n/uni00ADTier suppliers.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD24, 308/uni00AD1, 414/uni00AD1\n\n## -Prevention and remediation\n\nPrior to signing a contract with the BMW/uni00A0Group, suppliers are required to implement any necessary preventive or remedial measures to minimise potential risks or eliminate any deficits that may have been identified - including those in the areas of corporate governance, human rights and working condi/uni00AD tions, health and safety, and environmental protection - by an agreed target date, no later than the start of production, and to demand that these measures are also complied with by subcontractors. /uni2197/uni00A0 Further GRI Information , /uni2197/uni00A0 Sustainability assessment of relevant supplier sites The extent of the preventive measures is partially based on the potential risks, the nature and scope of the business activity and the size of the suppli/uni00AD\n\ner.

The Group reviewed a total of 49 poten/uni00AD tial and active supplier locations via this method during the year under report (2021: 38) 1, 2 . We have set ourselves the target of ensuring that all Tier/uni00AD1 supplier sites that have been audited meet the locally applicable legal requirements for sustainability as well as international human rights standards (BMW/uni00A0Group minimum requirements). In 2022, the final au/uni00AD dits confirmed that all cases of non/uni00ADcompliance with mini/uni00AD mum requirements (non/uni00ADconformities) that were identified in initial audits had been redressed.\n\nThe internal Human Rights Contact Supply Chain unit deals with any indications of possible violations of the  sustainability requirements stipulated by the BMW/uni00A0Group for the supplier network. We also use the standardised RBA Voices grievance mechanism as a complementary measure. In addition, /uni2197/uni00A0  whistle/uni00ADblower systems to detect possible legal violations are in place and compliance checks performed. Our aim is to ensure that any substantiated reports of environmental or human rights violations are redressed by agreeing on corrective measures.",

For this reason, the Group has established a firm commitment to make carbon/uni00ADreducing meas/uni00AD ures/uni200A 2 an award criterion in its supplier network. We specifically empower suppliers via the BMW/uni00A0Group Partner Portal and addi/uni00AD tionally provide face/uni00ADto/uni00ADface formats for conducting partner work/uni00AD shops at our plant in Landshut (Germany). /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 3/uni00AD3\n\nIn 2022, the number of contractual agreements with suppliers on carbon/uni00ADreducing measures increased to 468 awards (2021: 429 awards), including agreements on the use of secondary raw ma/uni00AD terials, biomaterials and carbon/uni00ADreduced steel routes. However, in our view, green electricity offers the greatest potential for re/uni00AD ducing carbon emissions in the supply chain. The BMW/uni00A0Group makes its use/uni200A 2 for direct suppliers (Tier/uni00AD1) and energy/uni00ADintensive processes in the upstream chain (n/uni00ADTier) a criterion for awarding new contracts to manufacture carbon/uni00ADintensive components and materials. During the year under report, we concluded agree/uni00AD ments for 343 contracts (2021: 427 contracts). In addition, since mid/uni00AD2021 the BMW/uni00A0Group has concluded framework agreements with 46 of its largest suppliers regarding the use of green elec/uni00AD tricity/uni200A 3 to manufacture its components.\n\nAgreements reached with suppliers regarding carbon reduction measures in production scenarios already began to take effect in 2022. Together with an external auditor, the BMW/uni00A0Group has developed a concept for verifying compliance with these agree/uni00AD ments and confirmed compliance with contractually agreed /uni2197/uni00A0 carbon/uni00ADreducing measures in the supplier chain at 23 suppliers in the course of 2022. As a result, the BMW/uni00A0Group helped reduce car/uni00AD bon emissions at the production facilities of its suppliers by approximately 1.0/uni00A0million tonnes in the reporting period. 4\n\nThe Group also continues to rely on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) supply chain programme to assess supply chain perfor/uni00AD mance in terms of its decarbonisation commitment. Measures relevant for supplier development and empowerment are also derived from the programme.

They bring different perspectives, experiences and competencies to their daily work, and can therefore make us more innovative and competitive as a company. The BMW/uni00A0Group there/uni00AD fore values an unprejudiced, appreciative and inclusive working environment for all its employees. Key principles such as protec/uni00AD tion against discrimination, equal treatment of all employees and respect at all times are firmly embedded in the /uni2197/uni00A0BMW /uni00A0Group Code of Conduct and /uni00A0the /uni2197 BMW/uni00A0Group Code of Human Rights and Working Conditions. These principles include equal pay regardless of gen/uni00AD der, religion, background, age, disability, sexual orientation and country/uni00ADspecific characteristics. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 405/uni00AD2\n\nAll employees can contact their line managers, the responsible specialist departments, the HR department, the Works Council or disability representatives if they have any pertinent concerns. The BMW/uni00A0Group SpeakUP Line is a telephone service available in over 30 languages that gives employees worldwide the oppor/uni00AD tunity to report possible violations both anonymously and confi/uni00AD dentially (/uni2197/uni00A0Whistleblower Systems for Detecting Possible Legal Violations and Compliance Controls ). In addition, a Zero Tolerance hotline was launched in late 2022. This provides employees with free, anony/uni00AD mous and professional advice on the topics of discrimination, workplace bullying and sexual harassment at work.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 406/uni00AD1\n\n## Promoting diversity\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group sees diversity as a strength. Using a variety of training events, presentations and dialogue formats, we raise awareness among employees and managers to the positive con/uni00AD tribution that diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion can make to the business. The BMW/uni00A0Group also promotes these topics in its recruitment and personnel development strategies.\n\nWe embrace diversity in all its facets on the basis of our concept for diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion. This is implement/uni00AD ed by HR management together with the disciplinary line man/uni00AD agers. The concept contains aims and measures that focus on five key dimensions:\n\n- - Gender\n- - Age and experience\n- - Cultural background\n- - Sexual orientation and identity\n- - Physical and mental ability\n\nWe provide information about our commitment to these catego/uni00AD ries on our /uni2197 website.\n\n## BMW/uni00A0AG employees according to age group, divided into functions and gender\n\n| in/uni00A0%        | < 30  years                        | 30-50  years                        | > 50  years                          |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 2020 in total      | /one.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/four.tf  | /five.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/nine.tf  | /two.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/seven.tf   |\n| 2021 in total      | /nine.tf/period.tf/eight.tf        | /five.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/nine.tf  | /three.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/three.tf |\n| 2022 in total      | /one.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/eight.tf | /five.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/eight.tf | /two.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/four.tf    |\n| direct /uni200A1   | /one.tf/four.tf/period.tf/four.tf  | /five.tf/four.tf/period.tf/one.tf   | /three.tf/one.tf/period.tf/five.tf   |\n| indirect /uni200A2 | /eight.tf/period.tf/six.tf         | /six.tf/three.tf/period.tf/three.tf | /two.tf/eight.tf/period.tf/one.tf    |\n| male               | /nine.tf/period.tf/nine.tf         | /five.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/one.tf   | /three.tf/one.tf/period.tf/zero.tf   |\n| female             | /one.tf/five.tf/period.tf/four.tf  | /six.tf/three.tf/period.tf/six.tf   | /two.tf/one.tf/period.tf/zero.tf     |\n\nWe launched a variety of measures within the scope of these five dimensions during 2022. For example, the trainee exchange pro/uni00AD gramme MOVE was launched in the reporting year and attracted more than 100 trainees. This gives young people the  opportunity to experience intercultural collaboration through practical work experience placements at different sites. During the year under report, we also continued with measures such as the Joint Leader/uni00AD ship Programme, which enjoyed greater popularity during its second year. The Group/uni00ADwide Diversity Week took place for the tenth time in 2022. In the newly developed Zero Tolerance train/uni00AD ing course, we also increase managers' awareness of the impor/uni00AD tance of providing a non/uni00ADdiscriminatory work environment.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group actively promotes an environment that offers equal opportunity regardless of physical or mental disabilities. Last year, we joined the international /uni2197/uni00A0The Valuable 500 initiative, which champions a more inclusive world of work. In 2022, we also adopted a revision of BMW/uni00A0AG's Company inclusion agree/uni00AD ment for employees with disabilities, thus strengthening our commitment in this area. At the same time, we expanded our requirements for barrier/uni00ADfree access in the areas of construction and IT. As in previous years, BMW/uni00A0AG in Germany awarded con/uni00AD tracts amounting to around \u20ac/uni00A041.1/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A024.2/uni00A0million) in 2022 to workshops staffed by people with disabilities. 3 /uni200A",

The dialogue generated by these internal networks creates further momentum for the BMW/uni00A0Group's commitment to this area.\n\nConcepts to promote diversity, equal opportunity and inclusion have also been developed in relation to the composition of the Board of Management and Supervisory Board.

By 2025, we aim to increase the share of women in the BMW/uni00A0Group workforce as a whole to between 20 and 22 % and to between 17 to 19 % for BMW/uni00A0AG. We aim to boost the share of women holding management positions in the BMW/uni00A0Group to 22 % by 2025, and to 20 % for BMW/uni00A0AG.\n\nThe share of women in management functions/uni200A 3 within the BMW/uni00A0Group has been rising steadily for many years. Globally, the share of female managers in the BMW/uni00A0Group stood at 20.2 % at the end of the year under report (2021: 18.8 %). During the period from 2011 to 2022, the number of women in management positions in BMW/uni00A0AG has more than doubled.\n\nExpressed as a percentage, the share of female managers at BMW/uni00A0AG was 18.2 % at the end of 2022 (2021: 17.5 %).\n\nThe share of women in the BMW/uni00A0Group workforce as a whole reached 18.6 % (2021: 19.7/uni200A%). For BMW/uni00A0AG, the share was 16.5 % (2021: 16.0 %). /uni2197/uni00A0Further GRI Information\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is also aware of the need to achieve a high per/uni00AD centage of women in our future talents programmes. By doing so, we aim to ensure that the share of women in the total workforce and in management functions continues to rise in the future. The proportion remained high in the trainee programme (Global Leader Development Programme/uni200A 5 ) in 2022 at 45 % (2021: 47 %).

As such, we not only live up to our own/uni00A0 aspirations  but  also  the  expectations  of  society  and our/uni00A0 stakeholders worldwide. The close partnership with the /uni2197/uni00A0 BMW/uni00A0 Foundation Herbert Quandt plays a central role in this. As an/uni00A0 important partner, the independent corporate foundation contributes with its activities to the perception of social respon/uni00AD sibility at the BMW/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Enshrining responsible practices within the Company\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0 Group aspires to address concrete concerns and achieve a long/uni00ADterm impact by means of its corporate citizenship activities. We only get involved in areas where our own resources can actually make an effective contribution to society. Four main areas can be derived from our core area of business and our skills:\n\n- - Responsible Leadership for sustainable development\n- - Education for future generations\n- - Inclusion for equal opportunities\n- - Culture and Sports for a united world\n\nOur employees are multipliers for this approach. One area of focus is therefore to provide opportunities for networking and flexibility. One example of this is the accelerator programme In/uni00AD novation for Impact, which supports young employees at the BMW/uni00A0Group to develop their own projects looking at innovative technologies that can help to solve global challenges. This pro/uni00AD gramme resulted in /uni2197/uni00A0PowerUp , for example - a project consider/uni00AD ing the secondary use of high/uni00ADvoltage batteries from the Devel/uni00AD opment unit. Thanks to the commitment of the project members, these batteries are now used by a school in South Africa in order to store energy generated by its photovoltaic system.\n\nThe international networking of young executives has been fa/uni00AD cilitated since 2016 by participation in the One Young World Summit. A delegation from the BMW/uni00A0Group took part once again in 2022. Fostering dialogue is also at the heart of our partnership with the UN Alliance of Civilizations. The Intercultural Innovation Award, which was first granted in 2011, was further developed in/uni00A0 2022 into the Intercultural Innovation Hub - a platform for networking and promoting social innovation as part of an inter/uni00AD cultural dialogue. By late 2022, we had already reached over six/uni00A0million people through the platform's outstanding projects -  thereby achieving the goal originally set out for 2025 ahead of schedule.\n\n## Commitment in the context of the war in Ukraine\n\nWith regard to the consequences of the war in Ukraine, the BMW/uni00A0Group provided fast, direct assistance during the year un/uni00AD der report. This included providing immediate financial aid of \u20ac/uni00A01/uni00A0million, as well as a subsequent donation of the same amount to UNICEF. As part of a donations drive, employees also collect/uni00AD ed \u20ac 250,000, which were matched by another \u20ac 250,000 by the BMW/uni00A0Group. The \u20ac/uni00A02.5/uni00A0million collected in total is being used in particular for children from Ukraine who are in need of help.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group also provides specific humanitarian help at the BMW Group sites and along refugee routes. This includes provid/uni00AD ing vehicles for transporting food and medicines at the Poland/ Ukraine border and practical help at refugee reception centres in the form of language classes.\n\nWe also offer refugees long/uni00ADterm perspectives in the form of the/uni00A0 BMW/uni00A0 Group Fellowship Programme in cooperation with the/uni00A0 European School of Management and Technology (ESMT) in/uni00A0Berlin. As part of this programme, ten women from Ukraine received a scholarship for a Master's in Business Administration in 2022.",

In line with the Group's performance management, the outlook covers a period of one year. Short/uni00ADterm risks and opportunities are managed on the basis of a two/uni00ADyear assessment period. In addition, we report on medium/uni00AD and long/uni00ADterm risks and opportunities arising in connection with climate change.\n\nThe continuous forecasting process applied within the BMW Group ensures that it is constantly ready to take advantage of opportu/uni00AD nities as they arise, but also to react appropriately to any unex/uni00AD pected risks. The principal /uni2197/uni00A0Risks and opportunities are described in detail in the chapter of the same name and concern all perfor/uni00AD mance indicators. Actual outcomes may, however,  deviate from the outlook due to unexpected events.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has raised its global growth projection for 2023 to 2.9 %. Despite this upward revision, eco/uni00AD nomic growth over the coming year is nevertheless likely to be significantly weaker than in 2022. High inflation and the war in Ukraine are likely to continue weighing on the global economy. New virus variants, renewed pandemic/uni00ADrelated restrictions and/uni00A0prolonged supply bottlenecks could additionally slow the pace of economic growth. Further information on political and global economic risks is also available in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Risks and opportunities .\n\nForecasts for the eurozone as a whole indicate slight growth in 2023 (+ 0.3 %). In this context, corresponding rates of  economic growth are predicted for France (+0.4 %), Italy (+0.3 %) and Spain (+1.2 %). In the case of Germany, a recession cannot be ruled out in 2023 (-0.1 %), with private consumption held down by high inflation and industrial production potentially  affected by the energy crisis. Moreover, the global economic slowdown could result in falling demand for German export goods.\n\nEconomic output in the UK is also expected to shrink in 2023 (- 0.7 %).\n\nThe growth rate in the US is forecast to slow to 0.7 % in 2023. The Fed's interest rate hikes and the resulting unfavourable financing conditions available on the market are forcing com/uni00AD panies and households alike to cut back on spending.\n\nFollowing the easing of pandemic/uni00ADrelated restrictions, the  Chinese economy is expected to be significantly stronger again in 2023 and grow by 5.0 %.\n\nJapan's growth rate in 2023 is forecast to be at a similar level to/uni00A0the  previous year  (+ 1.2 %).\n\n## Currency markets and international interest rate environment\n\nCurrencies of particular importance for the international opera/uni00AD tions of the BMW/uni00A0Group are the Chinese renminbi, the British pound, the US dollar and the Japanese yen.\n\nIn view of high inflation, both the ECB and the Fed will continue to tighten their monetary policies in 2023. Against the backdrop of the war in Ukraine and high energy prices, the euro is forecast to weaken slightly against the US dollar during the outlook  period.\n\nAs in the previous year, the British pound is expected to move sideways against the euro in 2023.\n\nFollowing its appreciation against the euro in 2022, the Chinese renminbi is forecast to depreciate slightly against the euro in 2023.\n\nIn Japan, the central bank's highly expansionary monetary poli/uni00AD cy is unlikely to change significantly in 2023, potentially resulting in a further depreciation of the yen against the euro.\n\nThe currencies of emerging market countries such as Brazil and India are likely to remain under pressure against the US dollar and the euro in 2023 against the background of the benchmark interest rate hikes imposed by the Fed and the ECB.",

In China, the economy is likely to stabilise following the easing of coronavirus/uni00ADrelated measures, thereby resulting in a slight increase in registration figures.\n\n## International motorcycle markets\n\nThe/uni00A0BMW Group expects the world's motorcycle markets in the 250 cc plus class to decline slightly year on year in 2023. In par/uni00AD ticular, some major European markets, such as France and the UK, as well as the USA and Brazil, are likely to contract slightly. By contrast, the German market is set to develop solidly, while the markets in Spain and Italy are predicted to recover slightly compared to the preceding year. Motorcycle markets could also be severely impacted by supply bottlenecks, the further course of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in China, and a possible recession in 2023.\n\n## Expected consequences for the BMW/uni00A0Group\n\nFuture developments on international automobile markets have a direct impact on the BMW/uni00A0Group. A challenging competitive environment, the supply situation for vehicle components, the further course of the coronavirus pandemic and geopolitical developments could all have a significant impact on business performance. Flexible coordination between the Group's sales and production networks will help cushion the impact of un/uni00AD foreseeable developments in individual regions. /uni2197/uni00A0 Risks and opportunities\n\n## Assumptions used in the outlook\n\nThe outlook contains forward/uni00ADlooking statements based on the BMW/uni00A0Group's expectations and assessments and may be influ/uni00AD enced by unforeseeable events. As a result, actual outcomes can deviate either positively or negatively from the expectations de/uni00AD scribed below, due to changes in the political and economic en/uni00AD vironment as well as other factors such as the further course of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe following outlook covers a forecast period of one year and is based on the composition of the BMW/uni00A0Group during that time. The outlook takes account of all information available at the time of reporting and which could have an impact on the Group's per/uni00AD formance. The expectations contained in the outlook are based on the BMW Group's forecast for 2023 and reflect its most recent status. The basis for the preparation of and the principal assump/uni00AD tions used in the forecasts - which consider the consensual opin/uni00AD ions of leading organisations, such as economic research insti/uni00AD tutes and banks - are set out below. The BMW/uni00A0Group's outlook takes account of these assumptions.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and its potential implications for the BMW Group's course of business are being closely monitored. All ap/uni00AD plicable restrictions resulting from sanctions have been factored into the outlook.\n\nFrom a current perspective, the coronavirus pandemic is not pre/uni00AD dicted to have any significant impact on the results of operations, financial position and net assets position of BMW AG and the Group as a whole, and this assumption has therefore been ap/uni00AD plied for the financial year 2023. However, uncertainties remain regarding the impact of the lifting of the zero/uni00ADCovid policy in  China and any associated constraints on production and sales volumes.\n\nThe supply situation continues to be challenging. Under these circumstances, raw materials markets are expected to remain tense during the financial year 2023. The cost of precious metals is likely to continue rising, especially for the battery/uni00ADrelated raw materials required to move ahead with the electrification strate/uni00AD gy the BMW Group has adopted. On the other hand, the general availability of components and semiconductors is projected to improve slightly in 2023. The BMW Group also expects energy supplies to stabilise due to a number of factors, including higher energy efficiency and the various alternative sources of energy available. However, supply chains remain exposed to the risk of disruptions and substantial cost increases in light of labour short/uni00AD ages, limited parts availability, continued high prices for raw materials and energy and other unfavourable factors. As in 2022, higher logistics/uni00ADrelated costs will therefore continue to have a negative impact on earnings.\n\nDespite the current high level of inflation and interest rates as well as the various challenges described above, the BMW Group is confident that demand will remain stable. Targeted invest/uni00AD ments and the Group's close cooperation with its strong network of suppliers will help to achieve the targets it has set itself for 2023.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, deliveries to customers are forecast to increase slightly compared with the previous year, with selling prices remaining at a stable level.\n\nThe Group expects the situation in the used car markets to nor/uni00AD malise in 2023 due to the increased availability of new cars.",

Potential sources of political uncertainty include policies affecting trade and customs tariffs, security developments and a possible worsening of inter/uni00AD national trade conflicts.\n\n## Outlook for the BMW Group - key performance indicators\n\nDeliveries of BMW, MINI and Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brand vehicles by the Automotive segment are expected to rise slightly year on year due to improved availability and the considerable order backlog.\n\nTaking into account all of the aforementioned developments, an EBIT margin of between 8 and 10 % is forecast for the Auto/uni00AD motive segment in 2023. The RoCE for the Automotive segment is expected to finish within a range between 15 and 20 %.\n\nThe BMW Group expects to achieve its target of slightly reducing the carbon emissions generated by its EU new vehicle fleet by continuously improving the overall fuel consumption of its products and an increasing number of vehicles with alternative drivetrain systems.\n\nIn view of the increasing focus on all/uni00ADelectric vehicles, from the financial year 2023 onwards the BMW Group will report the share of all/uni00ADelectric vehicles in total deliveries, which is expected to increase significantly compared to 2022. The previous key per/uni00AD formance indicator 'share of electrified vehicles in deliveries' will no longer be reported.\n\nCarbon emissions per vehicle produced are forecast to decrease slightly.\n\nMotorcycles segment deliveries are predicted to increase slight/uni00AD ly. The segment EBIT margin is expected to finish within a range between 8 and 10 % and the segment RoCE between 21 and 26 %.\n\nThe RoE in the Financial Services segment is predicted to finish within a range between 14 and 17 %. Compared with the financial year 2022, the favourable results from remarketing lease returns are expected to weaken in 2023.\n\nAccordingly, Group profit before tax will decrease significantly. One of the main underlying reasons for this development is the one/uni00ADtime gain of \u20ac/uni00A07.7/uni00A0billion recorded in 2022 in conjunction with the remeasurement of the BMW Group's previous equity interests in BMW Brilliance.\n\nThe aforementioned targets are to be met with a slight growth in the size of the workforce. Likewise, the share of women in management positions in the BMW Group is expected to increase slightly.\n\nThe BMW Group's actual business performance may also deviate from current expectations due to the risks and opportunities discussed below in the chapter /uni2197/uni00A0Risks and opportunities .",

Internal Audit's findings are reported to the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board on a regular basis.\n\nThe design and implementation of the internal control system and the risk management system take particular account of the size, structure and complexity of the BMW/uni00A0Group. These systems are intended to detect, manage and mitigate significant risks. However, despite the comprehensive analysis of risks in general, any control and risk management system has inherent limita/uni00AD tions. For this reason, the occurrence of risks cannot be ruled out in all circumstances.\n\nTaking this factor into account, the Board of Management is not aware of any circumstances that give rise to doubts regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems. In par/uni00AD ticular, no material cases of non/uni00ADcompliance or systemic weak/uni00AD ness were identified that preclude such appropriateness and effectiveness.",

This is based on an effective risk and opportunity management strategy, which puts us in a position to be able to react quickly and flexibly to changes in the political, economic, environmental, social, tech/uni00AD nical or legal situation. The general risk situation is regularly evaluated as part of this. Changes are integrated during the year and within the long/uni00ADterm plans for the business.\n\nThe aim of our risk management system (RMS) is to identify, measure and actively manage risks, both individual and cumu/uni00AD lative, that could pose a threat to the profitability of the business.\n\nRisks and opportunities (including risks to reputation and cli/uni00AD mate/uni00ADrelated risks) are considered for the current and subse/uni00AD quent financial year. /uni2197/uni00A0Material short/uni00ADterm risks and opportunities In addition, medium/uni00ADterm and long/uni00ADterm risks and opportunities are also presented in connection with climate change.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0Climate/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities\n\n## Organisation of risk management\n\nRisk management is organised as a decentralised, Group/uni00ADwide network and steered by a centralised risk management function. The various BMW/uni00A0Group divisions are represented by Network Representatives. We draw on the expertise of climate experts in order to evaluate climate/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities. The responsibilities and tasks of the centralised risk management function, Network Representatives and climate experts are doc/uni00AD umented and accepted. All significant risks are firstly presented for review to the Risk Management Steering Committee, which is chaired by Group Controlling. Any material risks are then re/uni00AD ported to both the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee.\n\nOther functions such as Compliance and Human Rights and the Internal Control System (ICS) serve as key interfaces to the risk management system. In its capacity as an independent control body, Corporate Audit reviews the RMS established by the Board of Management on an annual basis.",

        "page_content": "According to our Group/uni00ADwide guidelines, every employee and manager has a duty to report risks via the relevant reporting channels. The key elements of the risk management processes and an appropriate risk culture are embedded in the BMW/uni00A0Group's core values, the Group's extensive rules and regulations on risk management and in its overall risk strategy. Furthermore, the BMW/uni00A0Group's risk management strategy is continually developed to reflect new findings and requirements. Training programmes and informational events are regularly conducted throughout the BMW Group, particularly within the risk management network.\n\nThe risk management process is applicable across the entire Group and comprises the early identification, analysis and meas/uni00AD urement of risks, the use of appropriate risk management tools and the monitoring and assessment of the measures taken. If no specific reference is made, risks and opportunities relate to the Automotive segment.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group uses standardised, suitable methods for meas/uni00AD uring all short/uni00ADterm risks, reputational risks and medium to long/uni00AD term climate/uni00ADrelated risks.\n\n## Short/uni00ADterm risks\n\nRisks relating to the current and subsequent financial year are\n\nshown in the section /uni2197/uni00A0 Material short/uni00ADterm risks and opportunities . These risks are measured using value/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk models and as/uni00AD sessed on the basis of uniform loss distribution metrics, thereby enabling better comparability of risks for both internal and exter/uni00AD nal reporting purposes. Risks are measured net of any risk mit/uni00AD igation measures that are already taking effect (net basis).\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE BMW GROUP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInternal revision and external audit",

        "page_content": "Risks are classified according to the risk amount (average earn/uni00AD ings impact, taking into account the probability of occurrence). The earnings impact may be significantly higher if the risk actu/uni00AD ally materialises (worst/uni00ADcase scenario, confidence interval: 99 %).\n\nThe impact of risks and opportunities is presented separately without offsetting.\n\nGroup/uni00ADwide effects and trends can be identified by aggregating all material short/uni00ADterm risks at Group level. For this purpose, the potential earnings impact of the risks is aggregated, taking cor/uni00AD relation effects into account. In order to assess the risk/uni00ADbearing capacity of the BMW/uni00A0Group, the aggregated amount of risks is compared with the risk cover amount (i.e. the equity capital of the BMW/uni00A0Group recognised for accounting purposes). A limit system for various risks helps monitor the risk/uni00ADbearing capacity.\n\n## Reputational risks\n\nQuite apart from the financial consequences, risks can also have an impact on the BMW/uni00A0Group's reputation. For these purposes, the BMW/uni00A0Group assesses all risks with regard to their impact on its reputation using a scoring model. Moreover, other overarching topics are monitored by means of regular media analysis. Any material reputational repercussions are described in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Material short/uni00ADterm risks and opportunities .\n\n## Climate/uni00ADrelated risks\n\nRisks associated with climate change are presented in the sec/uni00AD tion /uni2197/uni00A0Climate/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities . Climate/uni00ADrelated risks are evaluated as physical and transitory risks in accordance with/uni00A0the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate/uni00ADrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Transitory risks arise from the tran/uni00AD sition to a lower/uni00ADcarbon economy and are measured with the help of climate/uni00ADrelated risk drivers and qualitative expert assess/uni00AD ments. Physical risks arise due to climate change and are eval/uni00AD uated using external data on potential natural hazards. Potential short/uni00ADterm effects of climate change are already taken into ac/uni00AD count in the short/uni00ADterm risks. All short/uni00ADterm risks are evaluated for their climate impact. If a risk is categorised as climate/uni00ADrele/uni00AD vant, the climate/uni00ADrelated portion of the risk is determined. The potential development of climate/uni00ADrelated risks is measured for two reporting periods (medium/uni00ADterm until 2034 and long/uni00ADterm until 2050) and for three global warming scenarios.\n\n## Non/uni00ADfinancial risks as reported in the non/uni00ADfinancial statement (NFS)\n\nAlongside the maintenance of a comprehensive system of risk management, conducting business in a sustainable manner constitutes a core strategic principle of the BMW/uni00A0Group. Risks resulting from sustainability issues are generally identified via the Group/uni00ADwide risk management network.\n\nIn accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0289c of the German Commercial Code (HGB), risks that could have an impact on the non/uni00ADfinancial as/uni00AD pects referred to in the relevant legislation are reviewed as part of the reporting process. Material risks in this context are defined as those stemming from business activities, business relation/uni00AD ships and products and services provided by the BMW/uni00A0Group that are highly likely to have a seriously adverse impact. No material non/uni00ADfinancial risks were identified during the year under report.\n\n## Opportunity management\n\nIdentifying opportunities is an integral part of the BMW/uni00A0Group's strategic planning processes. The Group's range of products and services is continually reviewed on the basis of these analyses.\n\nThe continuous monitoring of key business processes and strict cost controls are also essential factors for ensuring high levels of profitability and return on capital employed.\n\nThe importance of short/uni00ADterm opportunities for the BMW/uni00A0Group is classified on a qualitative basis in the categories 'material' and 'immaterial'. Probable measures aimed at increasing prof/uni00AD itability are already incorporated in the outlook.\n\nClimate/uni00ADrelated opportunities are identified progressively as part of the ongoing strategy development process and described in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Climate/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities .",

Considerable uncertainties remain in the form of potential supply bottlenecks along the entire supply chain.  Higher prices for energy, raw materials and transport may have a neg/uni00AD ative impact. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the progression of the coronavirus pandemic may also significantly affect the global economy. However, if the effect of these issues were to prove less severe in 2023 than currently expected, opportunities could arise that could benefit both rev/uni00AD enues and earnings.\n\nOverall, no risks capable of threatening the continued existence of the BMW/uni00A0Group were identified either at the balance sheet date or at the date on which the Group Financial Statements were drawn up. The Management and the Supervisory Board do not see any threat to the BMW/uni00A0Group's status as a going concern. As in the previous year, the current set of risks to the BMW Group are considered to be manageable. All risks and opportunities that are expected to materialise have already been addressed in the Outlook Report. Liquidity requirements are currently covered by existing liquidity as well as the various financing instruments available.\n\nThe following sections illustrate potential future developments or events that could result in a negative (risk) or a positive (op/uni00AD portunity) deviation from the outlook for 2023 and 2024 and indicate their significance to the BMW/uni00A0Group.\n\nIn addition, unforeseen events could affect business operations and hence the BMW/uni00A0Group's results of operations, financial position and net assets as well as its reputation.\n\nThe following overview provides a summary of the material short/uni00AD term risks and opportunities:\n\n|                                                              | Risks                             | Risks                          | Opportunities   | Opportunities                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                              | Classification  of the risk level | Change compared  to prior year | Classification  | Change compared  to prior year |\n| Macroeconomic risks and opportunities                        | High                              | Increased                      | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Strategic and sector/uni00ADspecific risks and opportunities |                                   |                                |                 |                                |\n| Changes in legislation and regulatory requirements           | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Market developments                                          | High                              | Increased                      | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Risks and opportunities relating to operations               |                                   |                                |                 |                                |\n| Production and technology                                    | High                              | Increased                      | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Purchasing                                                   | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Sales network                                                | Low                               | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Information security, data protection and IT                 | High                              | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Financial risks and opportunities                            |                                   |                                |                 |                                |\n| Foreign currencies                                           | Low                               | -                              | Material        | -                              |\n| Raw materials                                                | High                              | -                              | Material        | -                              |\n| Liquidity                                                    | Low                               | -                              | -               | -                              |\n| Other financial risks                                        | Medium                            | -                              | Immaterial      | -                              |\n| Pension obligations                                          | Medium                            | -                              | Material        | -                              |\n| Legal risks                                                  | Medium                            | -                              | -               | -                              |",

        "page_content": "The following ranges apply for the purpose of classifying the risk amount for material short/uni00ADterm risks:\n\n| Class   | Risk amount                                                                                |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Low     | /Euro.tf /zero.tf-/two.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  million                                         |\n| Medium  | > /Euro.tf/uni00A0/two.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf-/one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf million |\n| High    | > /Euro.tf/uni00A0/one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf million                         |\n\nDue to the particular features of the business model, significant risks and opportunities relating to the Financial Services segment are presented separately in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Risk management system in the Financial Services segment .\n\n## Macroeconomic risks and opportunities\n\nEconomic conditions have an impact on business performance and hence on the level of earnings generated by the BMW/uni00A0Group. Unforeseen disruptions in global economic relations can have highly unpredictable effects. The risk is classed as being high and has increased as a result of various geopolitical challenges.\n\nWith regard to the war in Ukraine, there is a risk of a further es/uni00AD calation of the conflict and therefore of further sanctions imposed by Western countries on Russia as well as possible counter/uni00ADsanc/uni00AD tions and/or retaliatory measures by Russia.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and its impact remain a risk to the global economy. If the virus should continue to spread quickly following the end of the coronavirus restrictions in China, a high number of cases or a new variant of the coronavirus may once again require strict containment measures and continue to put global supply chains under great strain. As a result, shortages of (upstream) products may cause the recovery of the global econ/uni00AD omy to slow down.\n\nIn the trade war between the US and China, the focus is current/uni00AD ly shifting from simple tariff increases to further import and export restrictions on specific technologies. The tougher rhetoric on the status of Taiwan may heighten geopolitical tensions and pose an additional risk. This could also lead to less favourable import and export conditions for the BMW/uni00A0Group.\n\nAnother risk is of recession in Europe and the United States. Further interest rate hikes by the central banks due to high infla/uni00AD tion could slow economic growth over the long term. If the  higher interest rates do not take effect quickly or effectively enough, lower real incomes and a corresponding widespread drop in de/uni00AD mand may have a negative impact on sales volumes.\n\nMacroeconomic opportunities that could have a sustained pos/uni00AD itive impact on the BMW/uni00A0Group's results of operation are classi/uni00AD fied as immaterial.\n\n## Strategic and sector/uni00ADspecific risks and opportunities Changes in legislation and regulatory requirements\n\nThe introduction of more stringent legislation and regulations, particularly regarding emissions, safety and consumer protection as well as regional vehicle/uni00ADrelated purchase and usage taxes, poses a significant risk for the automobile industry. Country/uni00AD and sector/uni00ADspecific trade barriers can also be subject to change at short notice. Any sudden tightening of regulations in these areas could necessitate significantly higher investments and expenses or exert influence on customer behaviour and lead to disruptions in supply. The risk is categorised as high.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is seeing increasingly stringent vehicle emis/uni00AD sions regulations for conventional drive systems. The Euro 7 legislative proposal, published by the European Commission in November 2022, will result in tougher emissions requirements from July 2025. The use of additional technologies will be  required so that all vehicles are able to fulfil the expanded test parameters, and this is associated with additional risks. Elsewhere in the leg/uni00AD islative process, there may be substantive  changes with regard to requirements and implementation dates.\n\nThe EU institutions have agreed to reduce the CO2 fleet target to 0 g/km by 2035. In order to achieve this, it is important that the urgently needed framework conditions, such as full availability of renewable energies, adequate private and public charging infrastructure and access to raw materials for the construction of electric vehicles is reflected in the EU's legislative initiatives.\n\nA discussion of consumption values and carbon emissions may have an impact on the Company's reputation.\n\nChanges in trade policies could also have a positive impact on the BMW/uni00A0Group's earnings in the short to medium term. Any reduction in tariff barriers, import restrictions or direct excise du/uni00AD ties could result in lower manufacturing costs or enable products and services to be offered to customers at more attractive prices. Opportunities potentially arising from changes in legislation and regulations are classified as immaterial.\n\n## Market developments\n\nIncreasingly fierce competition among established premium manufacturers and the emergence of new competitors may affect the market share and the price and product mix. Shifts in con/uni00AD sumer preferences or changes in brand perception pose both risks and opportunities. For instance, the BMW/uni00A0Group could be confronted with short/uni00ADterm supply and demand distortions in the transition from conventionally powered vehicles to alternative drive concepts. The likelihood of market risks occurring may be categorised as high. It has increased because the current positive price and product mix may potentially worsen if there is a reces/uni00AD sion in individual markets.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group's sales markets are continuously monitored in order to optimally meet customer requirements and, at the same time, capitalise on opportunities in terms of sales growth and pricing. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as insig/uni00AD nificant.",

        "page_content": "## Risks and opportunities relating to operations\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to production and technologies\n\nPlant downtime is the main risk affecting production. Disruptions to production may be caused by supplier bottlenecks, shortages of production resources such as gas or electricity and also by problems with logistics. Information technology is playing an increasingly significant role and, as a result, IT breakdowns (for example due to cyberattacks) may cause issues in production. Furthermore, damage to the plant infrastructure as a result of fire or natural hazards, or due to machine and tooling failures, may also result in production downtime. The likelihood of such risks occurring is deemed high and has increased as a result of the very volatile environment.\n\nAll plants have drawn up measures to avoid and mitigate risks, and are supported in this by other business units, such as Purchasing.\n\nThe risk of production downtime due to parts supply is reduced via measures related to logistics, purchasing and the use of the production network. Measures are also taken to prevent and counteract damage to manufacturing equipment and longer downtimes due to targeted cyberattacks.\n\nPotential natural hazards are already taken into account when selecting a site and through the implementation of measures during construction. We reduce the risk posed by natural hazards or fire with the use of on/uni00ADsite fire services and employee training.\n\nRisks resulting from property/uni00ADrelated damage and damage due to downtime, as well as transport damage to vehicles already manufactured, are transferred to highly solvent insurance com/uni00AD panies. Due to the volatility of the international insurance mar/uni00AD kets, the BMW/uni00A0Group itself bears significant risks today. This solution may become increasingly relevant if premiums and de/uni00AD ductibles continue to rise.\n\nPotential short/uni00ADterm changes to the relevant legislation and reg/uni00AD ulations or changes in their national interpretation by the author/uni00AD ities may jeopardise our ability to receive type approvals in good time and, in extreme cases, may lead to the non/uni00ADadmission of a vehicle derivative, sub/uni00ADmarket or even a complete market.\n\nProduct recalls can lead to additional costs. The BMW/uni00A0Group establishes appropriate provisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatu/uni00AD tory warranty obligations. It cannot be ruled out, however, that additional costs could be incurred that are either not covered or not fully covered by these provisions. Despite the deployment of thorough quality assurance processes, such risks can always arise if the materials and/or processing procedures used prove insufficient - in some cases years after a product has been launched. A high number of recalls could also have a negative impact on the BMW Group's reputation. Further information on risks in conjunction with provisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatu/uni00AD tory warranty obligations is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note [33] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group sees opportunities relating to production pro/uni00AD cesses primarily in the competitive edge gained from mastering new and complex technologies. Given the long lead times in/uni00AD volved in developing new products, additional opportunities are not expected to have a significant earnings impact on the BMW/uni00A0Group.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to purchasing\n\nPurchasing risks relate primarily to supply risks caused by the failure of a supplier as well as to threats to BMW/uni00A0Group/uni00ADrelevant know/uni00ADhow within the supplier network. Production problems at the supplier level could lead to consequences caused by in/uni00AD creased expenditure for the BMW/uni00A0Group due to production inter/uni00AD ruptions and a corresponding reduction in vehicle sales. The risk is categorised as high.\n\nPotential reasons for the failure of suppliers to deliver include the lack of availability of raw materials, energy and other input ma/uni00AD terials, the occurrence of natural hazards and/or fires, develop/uni00AD ments in the security situation of a country, IT/uni00ADrelated risks and non/uni00ADcompliance with sustainability or quality standards. An in/uni00AD creasingly complex supplier network, particularly with sub/uni00ADsup/uni00AD pliers over which the BMW/uni00A0Group has only an indirect influence, as well as a lack of solvency on the part of suppliers, may influ/uni00AD ence the delivery of supplies to plants.\n\nFurther price hikes and additional charges from suppliers may also have a negative impact on earnings.\n\nThe rising threat of cyberattacks along the entire supply chain affects both the security of supply and the protection of expertise relevant to the BMW/uni00A0Group. In order to optimise the level of IT security along the value and supply chain, the BMW/uni00A0Group re/uni00AD quires its suppliers to provide proof of appropriate IT security certification.\n\nWhen selecting its suppliers, the BMW/uni00A0Group not only takes into account external requirements such as those contained in the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfalts/uni00AD pflichtengesetz), but also ensures that the BMW/uni00A0Group's sus/uni00AD tainability targets are met.\n\nCost advantages gained by developing local supplier structures near BMW plants in addition to innovative manufacturing technologies could lead to lower material expenses for the BMW/uni00A0Group. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as insignificant.",

        "page_content": "Supply bottlenecks may also have a negative impact on the rep/uni00AD utation of the BMW/uni00A0Group if customer demand cannot be met as expected.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to the sales network\n\nIn order to sell its products and services, the BMW/uni00A0Group oper/uni00AD ates a global sales network comprising independent dealerships, branches, subsidiaries and importers. The insolvency of dealer/uni00AD ships may have a negative impact on vehicle sales and the range of services available to our customers.\n\nCurrently, the necessary preconditions are being established for vehicles also to be sold via direct sales in future, particularly in Europe. It may not be possible to realise the associated earnings potential to the degree expected.\n\nOverall, the risks arising from the sales network can be catego/uni00AD rised as low.\n\nAs in other areas, the BMW/uni00A0Group is actively shaping the future of its sales organisation with a clear focus on placing customer requirements at the centre of its activities. Opportunities arising as a result are classified as insignificant.\n\n## Information security, data protection and IT\n\nDigitalisation and automation across all areas of the business and its products offer a wide range of opportunities for the BMW/uni00A0Group. At the same time, information technology (IT) re/uni00AD quirements regarding the confidentiality, integrity and availa bility of information are becoming increasingly strict. The threat level has continued to rise over recent years and the war in Ukraine is also contributing to the rise in cyberattacks. Moreover, legal and regulatory requirements are becoming ever stricter worldwide. Cyberattacks may be directed at applications or vehicle functions.\n\nIn view of the higher incidence of observed attacks, the risk amount - despite extensive security measures - is still classified as high.\n\nInformation and data can also be compromised by a lack of risk awareness and inappropriate behaviour. The main direct conse/uni00AD quences would be negative effects on Group revenues, disruption in production, or reputational damage. For this reason, the BMW/uni00A0Group has launched an interactive programme to provide regular training for every employee on the correct way to handle dangerous emails.\n\nProtecting information, for example from unauthorised access or misuse, has the highest priority. In conjunction with risk man/uni00AD agement requirements, risks relating to information security, data protection and IT are systematically documented, allocated ap/uni00AD propriate measures by the departments concerned and contin/uni00AD uously monitored with regard to threat level and risk mitigation. Regular analyses and controls as well as tight security manage/uni00AD ment policies ensure an appropriate level of security.\n\nHowever, despite continuous testing and preventive security measures, it is impossible to completely eliminate risks in this area. All authorised persons are required to treat information such as confidential business, customer and employee data with great care, use information systems securely and handle risks in a transparent manner. Uniform requirements that apply through out the Group are documented in a comprehensive set of rules and guidelines. A consistently applied policy of updating such rules and regulations to the current situation, coupled with reg/uni00AD ular communication, awareness/uni00ADraising and training measures, form the basis for a high level of security and risk awareness in general.\n\n## Financial risks and risks relating to the use of financial instruments\n\n## Currency risks and opportunities\n\nAs an internationally operating enterprise, the BMW/uni00A0Group con/uni00AD ducts business in a variety of currencies, thus giving rise to cur/uni00AD rency risks and opportunities. A substantial portion of Group revenues, production, other purchases and funding occur outside the eurozone. Regularly updated cash/uni00ADflow/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk models are used to limit currency risks and identify opportunities. The risk amount associated with currency risks is classified as low.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group manages currency risks at both the strategic (medium to long term) and operational level (short to medium term). Over the medium and long term, it is possible to ramp up production or also increase purchase volumes in foreign curren/uni00AD cy regions (natural hedging). Currency risks are managed in the short to medium term and for operational purposes by means of hedging on financial markets, the primary objective of which is to improve planning reliability for the BMW/uni00A0Group as a whole. Hedging transactions are entered into only with financial partners of good credit standing.\n\nDepending on exchange rate developments, opportunities may also arise.",

        "page_content": "## Risks and opportunities relating to raw materials prices\n\nAs a manufacturing company, the BMW/uni00A0Group is subject to price risks, particularly in relation to the raw materials used in vehicle production.\n\nThe analysis of raw materials price risks is based on planned purchases of raw materials and components containing those products. A cash/uni00ADflow/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk model is deployed to measure risks relating to raw materials prices. Price fluctuations for many raw materials such as precious metals, non/uni00ADferrous metals, raw ma/uni00AD terials for batteries and steel, and also energy, are hedged using financial derivatives and supply contracts with fixed pricing arrangements.\n\nThe prices of many raw materials continue to be subject to a high degree of fluctuation on commodity markets. Accordingly, the risk amount associated with raw materials prices is classified as high, but there are also significant opportunities.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nThe major part of the Financial Services segment's credit financ/uni00AD ing and leasing business is refinanced on capital markets. The risk of restricted access to funds is deemed low.\n\nThe liquidity concept, based on the experience gained during the global financial crisis, is rigorously adhered to and continuously developed. In the Financial Services segment, the use of the 'matched funding principle' ensures that liquidity risks are gen/uni00AD erally avoided.\n\nSolvency is assured at all times throughout the BMW/uni00A0Group by adhering to liquidity ratios and using a broadly diversified range of refinancing sources.\n\nThe liquidity position is monitored continuously and managed through the Group/uni00ADwide planning of financial requirements and funding. Further information on risks in conjunction with financial instruments is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0 note [39] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Other financial risks\n\nOther financial risks worth mentioning include counterparty risks as well as those arising in connection with investments in other entities.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group works together with banks to ensure that the available liquidity is optimally invested in order to hedge against financial market risks (relating in particular to currency, raw materials and interest rate) using derivative financial instruments and to protect payments made in advance. Counterparty risk denotes the risk that the BMW/uni00A0Group will not receive, or not re/uni00AD ceive in full, the payments due to it in connection with the invest/uni00AD ment and hedging transactions referred to above. A value/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk model is employed to measure counterparty risk, taking into account the creditworthiness of the banks and the business volumes involved. Risk is managed using a limit system, which includes daily monitoring of the extent to which limits are being utilised at the level of the individual counterparties.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group holds equity investments of varying amounts in/uni00A0numerous entities, which could give rise to risks requiring the recognition of impairment losses.\n\nThe risk associated with other financial risks is classified as medium. Potential opportunities resulting from the revaluation of investments are evaluated as immaterial.\n\n## Risks and opportunities relating to pension obligations\n\nFuture pension obligations are financed largely via external pen/uni00AD sion funds or trust constructs that are legally separate from the BMW/uni00A0Group. Externally managed funds are invested on capital markets in a broadly diversified portfolio with a view to enabling future pension payments to be disbursed out of pension assets. These arrangements greatly reduce the need to fund pension payments out of ongoing operations. Risks can arise due to fluc/uni00AD tuations in pension provisions and the related pension assets and may be presented differently according to IFRS and HGB due to different accounting standards.\n\nThe risk amount associated with pension provisions based on IFRS valuations is categorised as medium. Material opportunities can arise if the value of pension assets on the capital markets develops favourably or if pension obligations decreased at a more pronounced rate than the related assets.\n\nPension obligations are primarily measured using a discount rate (derived from market yields from high/uni00ADquality corporate bonds). This discount rate is subject to market fluctuations and therefore influences the level of pension obligations. Changes in other pa/uni00AD rameters, such as inflation rates and life expectancy, also impact the amount as well as the duration of future pension payments. Regulatory requirements may also affect the amount of pension obligations.\n\nThe fluctuation of pension assets reflects the volatility of various asset classes on capital markets. Investments are broadly diver/uni00AD sified (interest/uni00ADbearing securities, equities, real estate and other asset classes).\n\nRemeasurements on the liabilities and assets sides are recog/uni00AD nised net of deferred taxes through other comprehensive income and hence directly in equity of the BMW/uni00A0Group (within revenue reserves). Further information on risks in conjunction with pen/uni00AD sion provisions is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note [32] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Legal risks\n\nDue to the global nature of its operations, the BMW/uni00A0Group is exposed to various legal risks. Legal risks may result from non/uni00ADcompliance with laws or other legal requirements, or from legal disputes with business partners or other market partici/uni00AD pants. The risk amount is categorised as medium.\n\nLike all entities with international operations, the BMW/uni00A0Group is confronted with legal disputes, alleged claims relating in particu/uni00AD lar to warranty and product liability or intellectual property rights infringements and proceedings initiated by government agencies.",

        "page_content": "Any of these could, amongst other consequences, have an ad/uni00AD verse impact on the Group's reputation. Such proceedings are typical for the sector, may result as a consequence of realigning product or purchasing strategies to changed market conditions, or are antitrust related. Particularly in the US market, class action lawsuits and product liability risks can have substantial financial consequences and cause damage to the Group's reputation. More rigorous application, interpretation of, or changes to, exist/uni00AD ing regulations could result in a greater number of recalls.\n\nFor several years, lawsuits have been filed against BMW Bank GmbH (BMW Bank) by consumers claiming the withdrawal from loan and leasing contracts. Since the beginning of 2020, sever/uni00AD al references for a preliminary ruling have been filed with the European Court of Justice (ECJ). On September 9, 2021, the ECJ decided on the abstract requirements to be complied with by creditors in consumer loan contracts. The principal risk assess/uni00AD ment in this regard for the BMW/uni00A0Group Report 2021 is still valid. The following developments result from the ongoing legal pro/uni00AD ceedings: in the second quarter of 2022, the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) stated in a ruling that the provision on the default interest rate contained in the particular BMW Bank loan contract at issue in the proceedings did not meet the requirements set out by the ECJ. Therefore, there is a legal risk that borrowers might withdraw from the affected consumer loan contracts. For the period of use of the vehicle, customers are obliged to pay compensation in case of withdrawal from their loan contract. In September 2022, the ECJ held proceedings on the preliminary ruling on kilometre/uni00ADbased lease agreements and loans. A deci/uni00AD sion by the ECJ is expected in the course of 2023. This may result in further withdrawal risks. The possible financial impact of these proceedings cannot be definitively assessed at this stage.\n\nInternational movements of goods require compliance with ex/uni00AD tensive export control regulations. In addition to goods/uni00ADrelated restrictions, international trading may also involve personal, country/uni00ADspecific and end/uni00ADuse/uni00ADrelated restrictions. In particular, non/uni00ADcompliance with applicable EU and US export control reg/uni00AD\n\nulations could result in significant legal consequences for the BMW/uni00A0Group. In light of its strong presence in the USA and China, any intensification of the trade dispute between the two countries could be a potential source of additional risk exposure.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group is subject to governmental tax and customs audits in every country in which it operates, potentially resulting in back taxes, retrospective customs duties, interest, penalties and similar payments. Payments of this nature may, for instance, result from the non/uni00ADrecognition of intercompany transfer prices in the countries concerned. Further substantive legal risks may arise as a result of changes in tax or customs legislation or due to differences in the way that legislation is interpreted. In many cases, such changes can also have a retrospective impact on calendar years that were not yet subject to definitive audits. Risk management relating to tax and customs legislation is enshrined in the BMW/uni00A0Group's RMS. In order to minimise material proce/uni00AD dural tax and customs risks, the BMW/uni00A0Group has set up a com/uni00AD prehensive Tax Compliance Management System (Tax CMS) that is already being applied in its principal entities in Germany and China and will be rolled out successively in other major countries.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group recognises appropriate levels of provision for lawsuits and risks. In addition, a part of these risks is insured to/uni00A0an economically reasonable extent. Nevertheless, it cannot be/uni00A0ruled out that damages may occur in excess of the insured amounts. In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the required information is not provided if the/uni00A0 BMW/uni00A0Group concludes that disclosure of the information could seriously prejudice the outcome of the relevant legal pro/uni00AD ceedings. Further information on contingent liabilities is  provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A0[38] to the Group Financial Statements.\n\nA Compliance Management System is in place across the BMW/uni00A0Group to ensure, among other things, that its representa/uni00AD tive bodies, executives and staff members worldwide consistently act in a lawful manner. Further information on this can be found in the chapter /uni2197/uni00A0Compliance and human rights .\n\n## Risk management system in the Financial Services segment\n\nRisk management in the Financial Services segment is based on various pillars; namely, the prevailing risk culture, the risk strat/uni00AD egy and the defined risk appetite for the various types of risk. In addition to this, there are a wide range of guidelines in place worldwide that are implemented by the individual companies in the Group.\n\nThe central pillar of risk management in the Financial Services segment is the continuous assurance of risk/uni00ADbearing capacity. Depending on the type of risk, limits are assigned to define the risk appetite. Various value/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk models are used for this pur/uni00AD pose, which are validated at regular intervals. The confidence interval used in this model is conservative. Care is always taken that the coverage amounts based on the equity of the Financial Services segment are sufficient.\n\nRegular stress tests are carried out to support this model. These are another indicator of potential risk management measures and create a high degree of transparency with regard to extreme, realistic events, particularly in volatile times.\n\nRisk management in the Financial Services segment is based on the requirements of the supervisory authorities, which are imple/uni00AD mented consistently worldwide. Climate/uni00ADrelated risks are also taken into account and analysed at regular intervals, thereby considering a medium/uni00ADterm period in the future.\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0Climate/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities",

Further/uni00AD more, the credit portfolio is evaluated on an ongoing basis with the aim of determining if any impairment allowances need to be/uni00A0made for financial receivables. This evaluation is based on statistical methods and takes into account the following aspects, among others: the creditworthiness of the customer, the custom/uni00AD er's payment history and the economic situation of the custom/uni00AD er's region. The amount allocated to credit risks is categorised as medium.\n\nThere may be positive effects in the ongoing assessment of the portfolio's creditworthiness that lead to a reduction of the overall risk and therefore constitute an opportunity. The BMW/uni00A0Group classifies potential opportunities in this area as immaterial. Particularly in volatile times, the process of awarding credit may also be changed to take account of declining creditworthiness, or to not accept credit at all.\n\n## Residual value risks and opportunities\n\nThese primarily occur in connection with leased vehicles that are sold after being returned. The risk amount of residual value risks is classified as high. Opportunities may result from a positive deviation from the residual value forecast and are categorised as material.\n\nThe agreement is based on a forecast value for the vehicle's sale on return. This value may have been set too high or too low. In/uni00AD ternal models ensure the ongoing measurement of the portfolio; hence, current market developments are always taken into account.\n\nSustainability aspects are also evaluated in this context and long/uni00ADterm scenarios consider the development of the portfolio. Changes in drivetrain types are constantly being monitored and/uni00A0the findings are also incorporated into the evaluation. The forecast models for the beginning of the contract, as well as the ongoing evaluation of the portfolio, are continually developed.\n\n## Interest rate risks\n\nTo a limited degree, interest rate risks are deliberately accepted in order to make use of the associated return potential. Risks thereby result when there is a partial mismatch between fixed interest rate periods. These are evaluated as low, though they have risen compared to the previous year due to greater volatil/uni00AD ity. The associated opportunities are classed as material.\n\n## Operational risks\n\nOperational risks result from any form of ineffective or defective internal processes, systems, external events or human error. The aim is to systematically record and quantify all risks except for those listed in the paragraphs above. Because the risks arise in a wide range of areas of the Company, such as IT security or supplier management, the close dovetailing of these areas is essential and ensures that there is adequate transparency regarding the current risk situation of the entire division. The risk/uni00A0amount is categorised as medium.",

Consequently, the Company analyses a wide range of climate scenarios, identifies and measures climate/uni00ADrelated risks and  opportunities and adopts the relevant measures.\n\n## /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 201/uni00AD2\n\nIn doing so, the BMW/uni00A0Group follows the recommendations of the/uni00A0 TCFD and continually develops reporting processes and inter nal management strategies for climate/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities.\n\nDuring  the  2022  reporting  year,  all  material  risks  for  the BMW/uni00A0Group were considered for the first time in view of their sensitivity regarding climate change. The climate/uni00ADrelevant por/uni00AD tions were analysed in accordance with TCFD for three different climate  scenarios. For the medium/uni00ADterm timescale until 2034, we distinguish between transitory and physical climate risks. For the long/uni00ADterm timescale until 2050, the measurement focuses on the physical climate risks.\n\n## Climate scenarios\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group applies three scenarios to identify and assess climate/uni00ADrelated risks, which are based on the scenarios of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) of the Intergovernmen/uni00AD tal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nThese climate scenarios range from a low/uni00ADemissions scenario with global warming of < +1.5\u00b0C (Paris Agreement, SSP1/uni00AD2.6), a/uni00A0 medium scenario with warming of an average of +2.5\u00b0C ( the/uni00A0 middle path, SSP2/uni00AD4.5) to > +4\u00b0C (fossil development, SSP5/uni00AD8.5).\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group has committed to aligning its business activities with the low/uni00ADemissions scenario of the Paris Agreement and has consistently based its long/uni00ADterm corporate planning on this.\n\n## Transitory climate risks\n\nTransitory climate risks arise from the transition to a low/uni00AD emissions society across all sectors that is necessary in order to mitigate climate change. These risks become particularly appar/uni00AD ent when conditions change more quickly or differently than ex/uni00AD pected. The transitory climate risks were identified and measured for five  different risk dimensions. /uni200A",

For the BMW/uni00A0Group, this may have a negative impact on deliveries and the  residual value of existing products. In the Production and Purchasing units, remnant costs may result from switching processes and equipment.  -  The digital connectivity between companies and products to support decarbonisation is increasing in order to streamline processes and better manage emissions. Risks for the  BMW/uni00A0Group result from the time delay until such technologies can be used if, for example, some areas of the supply chain cannot provide the relevant standards and interfaces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Market and competition                           | -  Due to a global focus on sustainable products, energy prices and commodities costs are rising. This has a direct impact on manufacturing costs for the BMW/uni00A0Group and may go on to  affect deliveries. Furthermore, credit and residual value risks in the Financial Services segment may also be impacted.  -  Existing and new competitors are accelerating the production of electrified vehicles. If products and business models are perceived as being more attractive by customers, this may  have the corresponding impact on deliveries by the BMW/uni00A0Group.  -  Any serious failure to comply with sustainability or quality standards, or providing incorrect information, could cause disruptions in the supply chain or the inability of individual  suppliers to deliver.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Capital and financial market                     | -  A good position in the ESG ratings has a positive effect on the perception of a company on the capital market and has a favourable effect on investment decisions. Investment and  financing decisions by investors or lenders depend on a good ESG rating. Short/uni00ADterm and unforeseeable regulatory changes may reduce the appeal of a company on the capital  market and increase refinancing costs if it is not possible to react to the changes in the regulatory framework in good time. This may impact the credit rating and refinancing costs of  the BMW/uni00A0Group.  -  The short/uni00ADnotice termination of government subsidies to promote low/uni00ADcarbon mobility may reduce the demand for electrified vehicles.  -  Uneven adjustments of prices for carbon emissions could have a negative impact on the macro/uni00AD and microeconomic situation of a national economy, causing distortions in the credit  risk, for example. |\n| Politics, legal affairs and regulatory framework | -  Any short/uni00ADnotice tightening of legislation or regulations in the BMW/uni00A0Group's principal markets (EU, US, China) may exceed the speed at which BMW/uni00A0Group and its suppliers can  respond and pose risks in terms of delivery volume, costs and residual values.  -  Production processes must quickly be switched over to green energy sources and high/uni00ADefficiency systems that protect resources. The BMW/uni00A0Group already consistently implements  known requirements. However, additional costs may result if additional requirements are announced at short notice. -  For suppliers, stricter requirements for a circular economy, recycling and avoiding the use of resources may quickly lead to higher costs.  -  Fast rises and/or selectively discriminating regional vehicle/uni00ADrelated purchase and usage taxes may lead to higher costs or a decrease in deliveries.                                           |\n| Society                                          | -  Around the world, people's environmental awareness is increasing. Social discussions arising from a perceived worsening of the climate's health may lead to changes in mobility  patterns and/or customer preferences that may vary by region. This may require us to adapt the product portfolio, which may impact deliveries and residual values for vehicles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |",

Potential impacts are grouped into five different levels.\n\nThe potential transitory risks are deemed the highest over the medium term as a result of the fast/uni00ADpaced, sometimes unfore/uni00AD seeable developments in the Paris Agreement global warming scenario. It cannot be ruled out that more decisive measures will have to be taken globally in the next few years in order to achieve the < +1.5\u00b0C target. For the BMW/uni00A0Group, this is reflected primar/uni00AD ily in the risk dimensions of 'Politics, legal affairs and regulatory framework', as well as 'Market and competition'. Firstly, ad hoc regulatory requirements may enter into force that could impact products, production and the supply chain. In the 'Market and competition' risk dimension, risks may also increase due to high/uni00AD er demand and the resulting higher prices for select (scarce) raw materials on the one hand and due to rising energy prices on the other. /uni200A\n\n## Transitory climate risks\n\nShort/uni00ADterm\n\nScenarios medium/uni00ADterm (2034)\n\n## Physical climate risks\n\nIn addition to the transitory risks, the BMW/uni00A0Group also measures physical risks. In doing so, the increasing frequency and inten sity of acute extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, are taken into account, along with longer/uni00ADterm chang/uni00AD es such as in terms of temperature and rainfall. In order to meas/uni00AD ure such risks, we draw on external data that evaluate the devel/uni00AD opment of acute and persistent natural phenomena across the global warming scenarios and across time.\n\nFor the BMW/uni00A0Group, this may result in damage to assets such as buildings, vehicles or parts on the one hand, and, on the  other hand, such events may lead to downtime at BMW/uni00A0Group sites or at suppliers' sites.\n\nPhysical climate risks also increase for the BMW/uni00A0Group par/uni00AD ticularly in the long/uni00ADterm >+4\u00b0C scenario. This would lead to a higher risk both for the BMW/uni00A0Group's production sites and also for suppliers' sites.

Compliance is not just a matter of adhering to applicable laws and Company rules around the world. It forms part of our identity, our understanding of leadership and our  living culture of integrity. Compliance creates a binding framework for all our business activities.\n\n## Compliance as a corporate function\n\nCompliance is the managerial responsibility of the Board of Man/uni00AD agement of BMW/uni00A0AG, executed by creating an appropriate reg/uni00AD ulatory and supervisory framework, as well as through regular and ad hoc reporting, accompanied by clear communications. This approach is based on the core belief that compliance with applicable laws and related internal regulations is the responsi/uni00AD bility of all employees. As role models, managers are tasked with anchoring compliance culture in their area of responsibility and ensuring compliance requirements and processes are imple/uni00AD mented accordingly. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD23\n\nIn addition to being responsible for the Company/uni00ADwide Compli/uni00AD ance Management System, the Chief Compliance Officer also manages the Group Compliance division and briefs the Board of Management and Supervisory Board of BMW/uni00A0AG at regular in/uni00AD tervals.\n\n## Compliance Management System (CMS)\n\nThe BMW Group's Company/uni00ADwide Compliance Management System (CMS) reinforces the culture of compliance and integrity and helps reduce sanction and liability risks, as well as risks aris/uni00AD ing from other (non/uni00AD)financial disadvantages, such as reputa/uni00AD tional risks. The CMS focuses on adequacy and effectiveness and is based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond model, which defines specific preventive, monitoring, control and response measures. Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also essential.\n\nThe CMS is tailored to the Company's risk situation and address/uni00AD es all relevant compliance topics. Company/uni00ADwide, these include corruption and fraud prevention, anti/uni00ADmoney/uni00ADlaundering, antitrust and human rights compliance, export control, data privacy and product compliance. Responsibility for data privacy and product compliance lies with separate specialist departments outside Group  Compliance. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD27, 205/uni00AD1, 205/uni00AD3, 206/uni00AD1\n\n## Further development of CMS\n\nThe CMS is reviewed on a regular basis and refined as needed. The main drivers are strategic focus topics, legal and regulatory requirements and trends, best practices and industry standards, all of which are taken into account from a risk perspective. The objective is to consistently improve the CMS. The BMW/uni00A0Group is an active member of various associations and interest groups, including the German Institute for Compliance (DICO) at Board level and through its leadership of the working group on human rights.",

Since January 2022, the head of Group Compliance has also served as Human Rights Officer of BMW/uni00A0AG. Further priority areas emerged in the context of export control, due to the war in Ukraine, and in anti/uni00ADmoney/uni00AD laundering efforts, due to the increase in legislative initiatives.\n\nOne component of the CMS is the Data Privacy Management System (DMS), which is the responsibility of Group Data Privacy Protection, and also based on the Prevent, Detect, Respond mod/uni00AD el. The data protection directive (Privacy Corporate Rules) and Binding Corporate Rules, which contractually protect the transfer of employee data within the BMW/uni00A0Group, form the basis of the\n\nDMS. Implementation of the DMS is validated through regular reporting by affiliated  companies and independent audits carried out by Group Data Privacy Protection.\n\nAs part of the CMS, responsibility for product compliance, with a focus on compliance with technical requirements for BMW/uni00A0Group products, lies with the Quality Management division. The pro/uni00AD\n\ngramme was further developed during the reporting year as part/uni00A0of a broad/uni00ADbased project, with a primary focus on integrating the/uni00A0governance function more closely into operating processes and expanding training and communications activities.

More than 250 managers group/uni00ADwide perform these tasks for their area of responsibility as operational Compliance Responsibles.\n\nSpecialist departments worldwide are supported in their work by/uni00A0the central Group Compliance function, as well as the network of business unit and division Compliance Officers (heads of rel/uni00AD evant compliance functions), supplemented by around 80 local Compliance Officers (heads of local compliance functions) at BMW/uni00A0AG's international subsidiaries. Every Compliance Officer is tasked with implementing the CMS and compliance pro/uni00AD grammes for defined topics in their area of activity, as well as identifying and realising division/uni00ADspecific compliance measures.\n\n## Expanded training activities\n\nTraining opportunities are continuously refined for specific target groups. For example, during the year under review, we expanded our mandatory Company/uni00ADwide Compliance Essentials online training to six languages.\n\nOnline and classroom training with case studies and test ques/uni00AD tions, repeated every two years, strengthens the compliance culture and reinforces compliant behaviour. More than 81,000 staff and managers worldwide have so far completed the Com/uni00AD pliance Essentials training and 38,000 have received antitrust compliance training.* This offering is supplemented by manda/uni00AD tory data privacy training, which is available in 13 languages worldwide, and training courses on /uni2197/uni00A0human rights .\n\n/uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 205/uni00AD2\n\nIT/uni00ADbased compliance systems have been used for transparent and efficient documentation, assessment and approval of com/uni00AD pliance/uni00ADrelevant matters Company/uni00ADwide for years. This includes topics such as money laundering and sanctions lists, exchange activities with competitors, business partner due diligence and/uni00A0verifying the legal admissibility of benefits in kind. The data collected in this way forms the basis for the compliance risk assessment.\n\n## Compliance and notification systems\n\nEmployees with questions or concerns relating to compliance can discuss these matters with their managers or relevant departments and, specifically, with the compliance functions.\n\nReports may also be submitted anonymously and confidentially in several languages via the BMW/uni00A0Group SpeakUP Line notifica/uni00AD tion system or via the ombudsperson. /uni2197/uni00A0Checking effectiveness . The Compliance Contact serves as a further point of contact for both employees and external parties.\n\nThe BMW/uni00A0Group protects information providers in two ways: first, individuals may provide information without disclosing their iden/uni00AD tity; second, no one providing information faces retaliatory action. All queries and concerns relating to compliance are documented and processed using a Company/uni00ADwide electronic case manage/uni00AD ment system. If necessary, Corporate Audit, Corporate Security, the legal departments or the Works Council may be brought in. /uni2197/uni00A0GRI Index: 2/uni00AD16\n\n## CMS monitoring and controls\n\nThe CMS provides differentiated monitoring levels for reviewing observance and implementation of compliance rules and pro/uni00AD cesses at regular intervals. In addition to the direct checks per/uni00AD formed by Compliance Responsibles as business managers, risks are further reduced by additional measures integrated into busi/uni00AD ness processes, which generally form part of the /uni2197/uni00A0Internal Control System .\n\nIn 2022, the Detect function of central Group Compliance was further expanded to enable it to carry out ad hoc, independent compliance investigations. These include internal investigations in connection with official investigations, which serve to clarify the facts internally. Risk/uni00ADbased compliance audits aimed at identifying specific compliance risks are currently focused on antitrust law. Corporate Audit also monitors adherence to com/uni00AD pliance requirements by business managers, as well as selected elements of the CMS.\n\nAll control checks are geared towards reducing compliance risks. Any infringements are immediately remedied, with an emphasis on reducing the risk of repeat offences as far as possible. Where infringements can be traced to an individual, that person will be/uni00A0appropriately sanctioned, in accordance with the processes defined for this purpose.\n\nIn 2022, a compliance maturity measurement was also intro/uni00AD duced, with the aim of using defined criteria to make the ade/uni00AD quacy and effectiveness of the CMS, including implementation status, structured and transparent for the purpose of evaluation. In addition to the assessment of the Compliance Responsibles, the measurement also takes into account the assessment of compliance and other governance functions. Our overall state/uni00AD ment on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Internal Control and Risk Management System, including the CMS, can be found in the section /uni2197 Appropriateness and Effectiveness of the Internal Control System and Risk Management System .",

The focus of compliance management here is on an/uni00AD ti/uni00ADmoney/uni00ADlaundering, compliance with financial sanctions, infor/uni00AD mation and privacy protection, fraud prevention, legislative and regulatory monitoring, consumer protection and implementing the requirements of the German Financial Supervisory Authority. To manage these risks, the Financial Services segment has es/uni00AD tablished its own Compliance and Governance department, which works closely with the central Group Compliance function. On the basis of an annual analysis, it identifies the possible need for adjustments and defines appropriate measures. Worldwide implementation by the BMW Group's financial services compa/uni00AD nies is continuously reviewed and reported to the management of the Financial Services segment on a quarterly basis.\n\nIn the Financial Services segment, compliance is incorporated into the target management process.

The require/uni00AD ments for the design and structure of ICS procedures incorporat/uni00AD ed in accounting and financial reporting processes as well as those used to generate selected non/uni00ADfinancial information in/uni00AD cluded in the BMW/uni00A0Group/uni00A0Report are defined on a Group/uni00ADwide basis.\n\nThe ICS for financial reporting has the task of ensuring that sig/uni00AD nificant accounting and financial reporting processes deployed within the BMW/uni00A0Group are both accurate and reliable. The ICS for non/uni00ADfinancial reporting focuses primarily on the further development of the processes used to gather data as the basis for reporting the non/uni00ADfinancial performance indicators disclosed and consolidated in the BMW Group Report.\n\nThe ICS is based on the 'three lines' model, including a clear definition of how the various functions are required to interact with one another in order to manage risks. As a component of the second line, the ICS serves as the link between the operating units (first line) and Corporate Audit (third line).\n\nBasically, the aim of any appropriate and effective ICS is to pre/uni00AD vent or reduce the probability of occurrence of potential risks.\n\nInternationally acknowledged standards for internal control systems were taken into account when designing the various elements of the ICS deployed by the BMW/uni00A0Group (e.g. COSO model/uni200A 2 ).\n\nThe principal features of the BMW/uni00A0Group's ICS are a role/uni00ADbased approach embedded throughout the organisation, an environ/uni00AD ment, risk assessment procedures, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring activities.\n\nBoth the system itself and the methods applied are subject to continuous improvement, with system functionality being as/uni00AD sessed on a regular basis. Notwithstanding the measures taken, every control system is subject to inherent limitations, given that it is not possible to prevent all incorrect disclosures or detect them in a timely manner.\n\nRelevant BMW/uni00A0Group working instructions and guidelines for recognising, measuring and allocating items to accounts as well as definitions of non/uni00ADfinancial performance indicators are avail/uni00AD able to all employees via the BMW Group's intranet system. New/uni00A0financial reporting standards are assessed for their poten/uni00AD tial impact on the BMW/uni00A0Group's accounting and financial report/uni00AD ing systems.\n\nThe principle of segregation of duties is taken into account for all IT systems that are relevant for accounting and financial report/uni00AD ing. ICS requirements are also embedded in the ongoing devel/uni00AD opment of all IT systems used in these areas. Furthermore, the BMW/uni00A0Group deploys data analysis tools to identify and subse/uni00AD quently eliminate any weaknesses detected in its processes and/ or control systems.\n\nResponsibilities for ensuring the appropriateness and effective/uni00AD ness of ICS procedures for accounting and financial reporting processes as well as those relating to non/uni00ADfinancial performance indicators are clearly defined in a role/uni00ADbased model and allocat/uni00AD ed to the relevant line and process managers. Once a year, the managers responsible report on their assessment of the ICS in place for accounting and financial reporting processes, based on the results of both internal and external audits as well as contin/uni00AD ual monitoring. The results of the assessment are gathered and/uni00A0documented in a centralised IT system. Both the Board of Management and the Audit Committee are informed about the/uni00A0effectiveness of the ICS on an annual basis. The Board of Management and, where appropriate, the Supervisory Board, are promptly informed in the event of any significant changes to the ICS.",

The Com/uni00AD pany's shares are issued to the bearer.\n\nThe rights and duties of shareholders derive from the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in conjunction with the Company's Articles of Incorporation, the full text of which is available at /uni2197/uni00A0 www.bmwgroup.com . The right of shareholders to have their shares evidenced is excluded in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation. The voting power attached to each share corre/uni00AD sponds to its par value. Each \u20ac/uni00A01 of par value of share capital represented in a vote entitles the holder to one vote (\u00a7/uni00A018 no. 1 of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nThe Company's shares of preferred stock are shares as defined in \u00a7\u00a7/uni00A0139 et seq. AktG, which carry a cumulative preferential right in terms of the allocation of profit and for which voting rights are excluded. These shares confer voting rights only in exceptional cases stipulated by law, in particular if the preference amount has either not been paid or not been paid in full within one year and the arrears are not paid in the subsequent year alongside the full preference amount due for that year. With the exception of voting rights, holders of shares of preferred stock are entitled to the same rights as holders of shares of common stock. In addition, \u00a7/uni00A024 of the Articles of Incorporation confers preferential treatment to the non/uni00ADvoting shares of preferred stock with regard to the appropriation of the Company's unappropriated profit. Accordingly, the unappropriated profit is required to be appro/uni00AD priated in the following order:\n\n- (a) Subsequent payment of any arrears on dividends on non/uni00AD voting shares of preferred stock in the order of accruement\n- (b) Payment of an additional dividend of \u20ac/uni00A00.02 per \u20ac/uni00A01 par value on non/uni00ADvoting preferred stock\n- (c) Uniform payment of any other dividends on shares of com/uni00AD mon and preferred stock, provided the shareholders do not resolve otherwise at the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Restrictions affecting voting rights or the transfer of shares\n\nIn addition to shares of common stock, the Company has also issued non/uni00ADvoting shares of preferred stock. Further information can be found in the section /uni2197/uni00A0Composition of subscribed capital .\n\nAs  of  31  December  2022,  the  Company  owned  a  total  of 16,760,957 common and preferred stock, from which the Com/uni00AD pany has no rights pursuant to \u00a7 71 b AktG. The Company regu/uni00AD larly provides information about the current status of the share buyback on its website.\n\nWhen the Company issues non/uni00ADvoting shares of preferred stock to employees in conjunction with its Employee Share Programme, these shares are generally subject to a Company/uni00ADimposed block/uni00AD ing period of four years, calculated from the beginning of the calendar year in which the shares were issued.\n\nContractual holding period arrangements also apply to shares of common stock acquired by Board of Management members and certain senior department heads in conjunction with share/uni00ADbased remuneration programmes. /uni2197/uni00A0Remuneration Report /uni00A0(on shareholding periods for members of the Board of Managers)",

In addition, items meeting the criteria of IAS 7.22 (b) were included. In 2022, reporting was changed to a net basis. The figures for the previous financial year have also been adjusted (reported in 2021: at Group level inflows amounting to \u20ac 224,916 million, outflows amounting to \u20ac 232,089 million and change in other items amounting to \u20ac 1,829 million: and at the Financial Services segment level inflows amounting to \u20ac 218,348 million, outflows amounting to \u20ac 219,488 million and change in other items amounting to \u20ac 1,049 million). Reporting cash flows on a net basis where this is permitted improves the readability and comparability of the BMW Group's cash flow statement.\n\nThe reconciliation of liabilities from financing activities is presented\n\n- in /uni2197/uni00A0 note/uni00A0[37] to the Group Financial Statements.",

Pursuant to \u00a7 325 HGB, the Group Financial Statements and the Group Management Report are required to be submitted electronically to the agency that maintains the Company Register and may be obtained via the Company Register website. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG), which has its seat in Germany, Munich, Petuelring 130, is regis/uni00AD tered in the Commercial Register of the District Court of Munich under the number HRB 42243. BMW AG manufactures automo/uni00AD biles and motorcycles in the premium segment.\n\nThe Group currency is the euro. All amounts are disclosed in/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lions of euros (\u20ac/uni00A0million) unless stated otherwise.\n\nKey figures presented in the report have been rounded in accord/uni00AD ance with standard commercial practise. In certain cases, this may mean that values do not add up exactly to the stated total and that percentages cannot be derived from the values shown.\n\nThe income statement for the BMW Group and segments is pre/uni00AD sented using the cost of sales method.\n\nIn order to provide a better insight into the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the BMW Group, and going beyond the requirements of IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), the Group Financial Statements also include an income statement and a balance sheet for the Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and Other Entities segments. The Group Cash Flow Statement is supplemented by a statement of cash flows for the Automotive and Financial Services segments. Inter/uni00ADsegment transactions relate primarily to internal sales of products, the provision of funds for Group companies and the related interest. A description of the nature of the business and the major oper/uni00AD ating activities of the BMW Group's segments is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A047 (Explanatory notes to segment information).\n\nApproval for the publication of the Group Financial Statements was granted by the Board of Management on 7 March 2023.\n\n## 02  Group reporting entity and consolidation principles\n\nThe BMW Group Financial Statements include BMW AG and all material subsidiaries over which BMW AG - either directly or in/uni00AD directly - exercises control. This also includes 57 structured en/uni00AD tities, consisting of asset/uni00ADbacked financing arrangements and special purpose funds. In some cases, contractual agreements are in place with the asset/uni00ADbacked securities companies to offset their losses in connection with residual value risks arising from the receivables sold to them.\n\nIn relation to fully consolidated companies, the following changes took place in the Group reporting entity in the financial year  2022:\n\n|                                     | Germany         | Foreign                  | Total                   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Included at                         |                 |                          |                         |\n| 31 December 2021                    | /two.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/eight.tf/five.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/five.tf |\n| Included for the first time in 2022 | -               | /one.tf/five.tf          | /one.tf/five.tf         |\n| No longer included in 2022          | -               | /one.tf/six.tf           | /one.tf/six.tf          |\n| Included at                         |                 |                          |                         |\n| 31 December 2022                    | /two.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/eight.tf/four.tf | /two.tf/zero.tf/four.tf |\n\nAll consolidated subsidiaries have the same year/uni00ADend as BMW AG with the exception of BMW India Private Ltd. and BMW India Financial Services Private Ltd., whose year/uni00ADends are 31 March in accordance with local legal requirements. Interim financial state/uni00AD ments are prepared as at 31 December for the two companies with divergent reporting dates.\n\nWhen assessing whether an investment gives rise to a controlled entity, an associated company, a joint operation or a joint venture, the BMW Group considers contractual arrangements and other circumstances, as well as the structure and legal form of the entity. Discretionary decisions may also be required. If indications exist of a change in the judgement of (joint) control, the BMW Group undertakes a new assessment.",

        "page_content": "An entity is deemed to be controlled if BMW AG - either directly or indirectly - has power over it, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from it and has the ability to influence those returns.\n\nAn entity is classified as an associated company if BMW AG either directly or indirectly - has the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity's operating and financial policies. As a general rule, the Group is assumed to have significant influence if it holds 20  % or more of the entity's voting power.\n\nJoint operations and joint ventures are forms of joint arrange/uni00AD ments. Such an arrangement exists when a BMW Group entity jointly carries out activities with a third party on the basis of a contractual agreement.\n\nIn the case of a joint operation, the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of a joint operation are recognised pro/uni00AD portionately in the Group Financial Statements on the basis of the BMW Group entity's rights and obligations (proportionate consolidation). The impact of joint operations on the Group Financial Statements are of minor significance.\n\nThe BMW Group's largest joint operation is Spotlight Automotive Limited (Spotlight), which has been operated together with the Chinese automobile manufacturer Great Wall Motor Company Limited (Great Wall) since 2019, jointly developing and manufac/uni00AD turing electric vehicles in China. The BMW Group and Great Wall each hold 50  % of the joint operation's equity. In addition to electric MINI vehicles, Spotlight will in future also develop and produce electric vehicles for Great Wall.\n\nIn the case of a joint venture, the parties which have joint control only have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\nAssociated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, with measurement on initial recognition based on acquisition cost.\n\nBMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) was fully con/uni00AD solidated for the first time with effect from 11 February 2022. Detailed information is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A03 .\n\nOn 30 September 2021, the BMW Group signed an agreement with the Huachen Group to acquire all of the shares of Brilliance Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd, a Huachen Group subsidiary. However, the transaction was stilll not completed by the end of the financial year 2022.\n\nThe other changes to the Group reporting entity do not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position and net assets of the Group.\n\n## 03   Increased shareholding in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n\nOn 11 February 2022, via its subsidiary BMW Holding B.V., the BMW Group increased its shareholding in the BMW Brilliance joint venture from 50  % to 75  % with the acquisition of a further 25  % of BMW Brilliance's shares. On 11 October 2018, the BMW Group signed an agreement with its joint venture partner, a wholly owned subsidiary of Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd. (CBA), to acquire these shares. The agreement was approved at the CBA shareholders' meeting on 18 January 2019.\n\nThe previous joint venture requirement in China for businesses manufacturing conventionally powered automobiles came to an end with effect from 1 January 2022. The new joint venture agree/uni00AD ment came into force and the formal transfer of shares was com/uni00AD pleted on 11 February 2022, following the issuance of a new business licence. Since that date, the BMW Group has held a 75  % majority of the voting rights, as a result of which it now has control over BMW Brilliance. BMW Brilliance has therefore been fully consolidated as a subsidiary in the BMW Group Financial Statements with effect from 11 February 2022. The contractual term of the joint venture, which previously ran until 2028, has been extended to 2040.\n\nBMW Brilliance manufactures BMW brand models primarily for the Chinese market at its two vehicle production plants as well as petrol engines and high/uni00ADvoltage batteries at a separate facility.\n\nThe strategic objectives of the acquisition are to further strengthen the BMW Group's long/uni00ADterm collaboration with a partner in China, expand production capacities at the existing locations in Shenyang, and systematically increase the local production of further models, including New Energy Vehicles.\n\nThe consideration paid for the additional 25  % stake totalled CNY 27,941/uni00A0million. Converted and including hedging effects, the pur/uni00AD chase price amounted to \u20ac/uni00A03,735/uni00A0million, which was settled entirely in cash. Cash and cash equivalents acquired totalled \u20ac/uni00A08,746/uni00A0million. Overall, therefore, the cash flow statement for the Automotive segment shows a cash inflow from acquisitions (part of the cash inflow/outflow from investing activities) amount/uni00AD ing to \u20ac/uni00A05,011/uni00A0million. After deducting intragroup cash and cash equivalents, the cash flow statement for the BMW Group shows a cash inflow from acquisitions (part of the cash inflow/outflow from investing activities) amounting to \u20ac/uni00A03,587/uni00A0million. Intragroup cash and cash equivalents relate to cash deposits made by BMW Brilliance with the Group's financial services companies in China.",

        "page_content": "As the BMW Group already held 50  % of the shares in BMW Brilliance prior to the acquisition, the transaction constitutes a business combination achieved in stages (step acquisition). In this context, the Group's 50  % shareholding in BMW Brilliance at the acquisition date was measured at its fair value, which was calculated at \u20ac/uni00A0 12,341/uni00A0 million. The remeasurement gain of \u20ac/uni00A07,649/uni00A0million was recognised on the line item 'Result on in/uni00AD vestments' within other financial result.\n\nThe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in conjunction with the business combination were required to be identified and measured at their fair value. The fair values of the main groups of assets and liabilities are shown in the following table:\n\n|                                               | in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Reacquired rights                             | /seven.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf/one.tf       |\n| Dealership relationships                      | /five.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                           |\n| Other intangible assets                       | /four.tf/eight.tf                                 |\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | /six.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/three.tf/seven.tf        |\n| Right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse assets from leases | /six.tf/three.tf/five.tf                          |\n| Inventories                                   | /four.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/eight.tf/two.tf          |\n| Trade receivables                             | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/six.tf/nine.tf           |\n| Other assets                                  | /two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/zero.tf         |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | /eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/six.tf        |\n| Provisions                                    | - /nine.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf                        |\n| Trade payables                                | - /three.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/five.tf      |\n| Other liabilities                             | - /six.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/three.tf        |\n| Deferred taxes                                | - /one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/three.tf/zero.tf       |\n| Net Identified assets acquired                | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/four.tf/zero.tf |\n\nReacquired rights and dealership relationships identified in con/uni00AD junction with the business combination were recognised as in/uni00AD tangible assets. Reacquired rights were recognised as a separate\n\nintangible asset if they were contractually granted to Brilliance before control was obtained by the BMW Group. More specifically, they relate to rights granted by the BMW Group to the BMW Bril/uni00AD liance joint venture prior to the acquisition, allowing the latter to use specified vehicle production technologies and trademark rights.\n\nThese acquired intangible assets have a useful life of 6 to 7 years. Other fair value adjustments were also recognised, mainly for property, plant and equipment and inventories.\n\nThe remaining difference of \u20ac/uni00A01,197/uni00A0million between the consid/uni00AD eration transferred for 25 % of the shares and the previously held shares measured at fair value on the one hand and the Group's share of identifiable net assets acquired on the other was recog/uni00AD nised as goodwill. This essentially represents synergy benefits, given that the fair value of the reacquired rights already takes potential excess returns into account. The acquisition did not give rise to any goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill was allocated in full to the new BMW Brilliance cash/uni00ADgenerating unit within the Automotive segment.\n\nThe gross amount of acquired receivables corresponds to their fair value.\n\nThe remaining non/uni00ADcontrolling interest of 25 % held by other shareholders is measured on the basis of their proportionate share of identifiable net assets. Equity attributable to non/uni00ADcon/uni00AD trolling interests therefore amounted to \u20ac/uni00A04,960/uni00A0million.\n\nThe purchase price allocation has been completed. All adjust/uni00AD ments made during the year compared to the first announcement were of minor importance.\n\nSince the date of first/uni00ADtime consolidation, revenues and profit after tax amounting to \u20ac/uni00A028,031/uni00A0million and \u20ac/uni00A02,211/uni00A0million re/uni00AD spectively relate to BMW Brilliance. The figure reported for prof/uni00AD it after tax also includes depreciation and amortisation arising on the purchase price allocation as well as intragroup elimina/uni00AD tions attributable to BMW Brilliance. It does not, however, include the elimination of intragroup profits arising at other companies.\n\nIf BMW Brilliance had been fully included in the Group Financial Statements with effect from 1 January 2022, Group revenues and profit after tax for the twelve/uni00ADmonth period would have amounted to \u20ac/uni00A0145,521/uni00A0million and \u20ac/uni00A018,842/uni00A0million respectively.\n\nFollowing the business combination, the equity capital of BMW Automotive Finance (China) Co. Ltd. and Herald International Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. attributable to non/uni00ADcontrolling inter/uni00AD ests changed to 10.5 % in each case (previously 21 %). As the two entities were already included in the Group Financial State/uni00AD ments as subsidiaries, the change was recognised through Group equity without any impact on profit or loss.\n\n## 04  Other significant events during the financial year 2022 Russia/uni00ADUkraine war\n\nMajor uncertainties remained at 31 December 2022 with respect to the ongoing Russia/uni00ADUkraine war. The sanctions imposed and the countermeasures taken in this context significantly restrict economic activities with Russia and also have an impact on the Russian companies of the BMW Group.\n\nIn connection with the Russia/uni00ADUkraine war, allowances for ex/uni00AD pected credit losses on receivables from sales financing were increased in the financial year 2022 to take account of the negative impact on retail customer business, to the extent not covered by the BMW Group's standard loss provisioning models (post/uni00ADmodel adjustments).",

        "page_content": "The restrictions currently in place for payments mean that trans/uni00AD fers of liquid funds from Russia are limited. Developments in this area are reviewed by the BMW Group on a regular basis. In total, the Russian companies hold around 5 % of the BMW Group's cash and cash equivalents.\n\nCurrent restrictions on transfers from Russia mean that the credit default risk vis/uni00AD\u00e0/uni00ADvis Russian companies is elevated. In this con/uni00AD text, impairment allowances were recognised on receivables from a non/uni00ADconsolidated Russian subsidiary.\n\nFor a certain number of vehicles sold on the Russian market, warranty arrangements give rise to a repurchase obligation. In accordance with IFRS 15, this obligation has been recognised as a reduction of revenue in the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nFor inventory valuation purposes, write/uni00ADdowns were recognised on vehicles and parts destined for the Russian market.\n\nThe Russia/uni00ADUkraine war also had an impact on foreign exchange markets, causing heightened volatility of the Russian rouble (RUB) during the first half of the year.\n\nA closing rate of RUB 77.12 to the euro was applied at 31 Decem/uni00AD ber 2022. The BMW Group has been able to execute transactions at this rate. Compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2021 (RUB 85.23), the value of assets has appreciated. If the previous year's exchange rate had been applied at 31 December 2022, BMW Group total assets would have been 0.1 % lower.\n\nOverall, the effects described above as a consequence of the Russia/uni00ADUkraine war have so far had a negative impact on the BMW Group's earnings in the mid/uni00ADthree/uni00ADdigit/uni00A0million range.\n\n## 05  Foreign currency translation and measurement\n\nThe financial statements of consolidated companies which are presented in a foreign currency are translated using the modified closing rate method. Under this method, assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate, whilst income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate. Differ/uni00AD ences arising on foreign currency translation are presented in 'Accumulated other equity'. In the single entity accounts of BMW AG and its subsidiaries, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured on initial recognition using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of first/uni00ADtime recognition. Advance pay/uni00AD ments to suppliers or from customers in a foreign currency that result in the addition of non/uni00ADmonetary assets or liabilities are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of payment. At the end of the reporting period, foreign currency receivables and payables are measured using the closing exchange rate. The resulting unrealised gains and losses, as well as realised gains and losses arising on settlement, are recognised in the income statement, in line with the underlying substance of the transac/uni00AD tion. Non/uni00ADmonetary balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies are rolled forward on the basis of historical exchange rates.\n\nThe exchange rates of currencies which have a material impact on the Group Financial Statements were as follows:\n\n|                  | Closing rate                                   | Closing rate                                        | Average rate                                       | Average rate                                       |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 Euro =         | 31. 12. 2022                                   | 31. 12. 2021                                        | 2022                                               | 2021                                               |\n| US Dollar        | /one.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf             | /one.tf/period.tf/one.tf/four.tf                    | /one.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/five.tf                  | /one.tf/period.tf/one.tf/eight.tf                  |\n| Chinese Renminbi | /seven.tf/period.tf/three.tf/six.tf            | /seven.tf/period.tf/two.tf/two.tf                   | /seven.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf               | /seven.tf/period.tf/six.tf/three.tf                |\n| British Pound    | /zero.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf            | /zero.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/four.tf                 | /zero.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/five.tf                | /zero.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/six.tf                 |\n| Russian Rouble   | /seven.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/one.tf/two.tf     | /eight.tf/five.tf/period.tf/two.tf/three.tf         | /seven.tf/three.tf/period.tf/seven.tf/two.tf       | /eight.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/one.tf/eight.tf       |\n| Japanese Yen     | /one.tf/four.tf/one.tf/period.tf/one.tf/one.tf | /one.tf/three.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/three.tf/eight.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/two.tf | /one.tf/two.tf/nine.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf |",

        "page_content": "Argentina has fulfilled the definition of a hyperinflationary economy since 1 July 2018. Since that date, IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies) has therefore been applied for the BMW subsidiary in Argentina. The price indices published by the Federaci\u00f3n Argentina de Consejos Profesion/uni00AD ales de Ciencias Econ\u00f3micas (FACPCE) are used to adjust non/uni00ADmonetary assets and liabilities and items in the income statement. The resulting effects are not material for the BMW Group.\n\n## 06   Financial reporting rules\n\n## a   Financial reporting standards applied for the first time in the financial year 2022\n\nStandards or amendments to standards applied for the first time in the financial year 2022 did not have any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n## b   Financial reporting pronouncements issued by the IASB, but not yet applied\n\nIn May 2017 the IASB published IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts. The Standard replaces IFRS 4 and contains new rules relating to the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure require/uni00AD ments for insurance contracts. The new rules are mandatory for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023.\n\nIn a Group/uni00ADwide project, the BMW Group examined the impact of adopting IFRS 17 for existing agreements. The BMW Group offers various products that meet the definition of an insurance contract in accordance with IFRS 17. However, for the majority of these products, either an exemption applies (e.g. for warranty agreements) or the insurance arrangements qualify as fixed/uni00ADfee service contracts, which can continue to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 15 due to the option available in IFRS 17. In some markets, however, products are offered (e.g. compre/uni00AD hensive vehicle insurance) that are required to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 17. These contracts can be accounted for using the premium allocation approach, which is essentially the same as the current accounting method applied for these\n\ncontracts. In the financial year 2022, insurance premiums total/uni00AD ling \u20ac/uni00A0191/uni00A0million were recognised in revenues for these contracts. At 31 December 2022, the insurance liability for the remaining term of these contracts amounted to \u20ac/uni00A0282/uni00A0million and the liability for incurred claims to \u20ac/uni00A012/uni00A0million. The option to adopt IFRS 17 early was not applied.\n\nSimilarly, other financial reporting standards and revised stand/uni00AD ards issued by the IASB that have not yet been applied are not expected to have any significant impact on the BMW Group Financial Statements.\n\n## c  Accounting policy changes in the financial year 2022\n\nIn the previous year, transitory items were reported within cash flows from financing activities on a gross basis. In addition, items meeting the criteria of IAS 7.22 (b) were included. In 2022, re/uni00AD porting was changed to a net basis. The figures for the previous financial year have also been adjusted (reported in 2021: at Group level inflows amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0224,916/uni00A0million, outflows amounting to \u20ac232,089/uni00A0million and change in other items amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0 1,829/uni00A0million: and at the Financial Services segment level inflows amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0218,348/uni00A0million, outflows amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0 219,488/uni00A0 million and change in other items amounting to \u20ac/uni00A01,049/uni00A0million). Reporting cash flows on a net basis where this is permitted improves the readability and comparability of the BMW Group's cash flow statement.\n\n## 07   Accounting policies, assumptions, judgements and estimations\n\nThe impact of climate change has been taken into account by the Board of Management when preparing the Group Financial Statements. As a matter of principle, the Group Financial State/uni00AD ments are prepared in accordance with the BMW Group's long/uni00AD term corporate plan, as approved by management, taking into account issues relevant for climate change such as the transfor/uni00AD mation to electromobility, regulatory requirements and changes in production conditions.\n\nAs a consequence of joining the Business Ambition for 1.5 \u00b0C campaign led by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), the BMW Group pursues validated SBTi Near Term Targets for the year 2030, which are incorporated in the Group's long/uni00ADterm cor/uni00AD porate plan.\n\nIn line with the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate/uni00AD related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), both physical and transi/uni00AD tion/uni00ADrelated risks and opportunities are taken into account in the Group's internal performance management system and in con/uni00AD junction with the preparation of the Group Financial Statements. These risks and opportunities, together with the impact of climate change that has already taken place over the past year are referred to below as 'climate/uni00ADrelated aspects'.\n\nClimate/uni00ADrelated aspects are considered in the preparation of the Group Financial Statements, and are particularly relevant in the case of assumptions, judgements and estimations relating to future developments that impact the BMW Group and its envi/uni00AD ronment.\n\nMore detailed information on how climate/uni00ADrelated aspects are taken into account for recognition and measurement purposes is provided below, particularly in the comments on property, plant and equipment, leased products and the performance of impair/uni00AD ment tests. This includes an indication of the extent to which climate/uni00ADrelated aspects have been taken into account in the es/uni00AD timations and assumptions for the recognition and measurement of balance sheet items.\n\nRevenues from customer contracts include in particular revenues from the sale of products (primarily new and pre/uni00ADowned vehicles and related products) as well as revenues from services. Revenue is recognised when control is transferred to the dealership or retail customer. In the case of sales of products, this is usually at the point in time when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. Revenues are stated net of settlement discount, bo/uni00AD nuses and rebates as well as interest and residual value subsi/uni00AD",

        "page_content": "dies. The consideration arising from these sales usually falls due for payment immediately or within 30 days. In exceptional cases, a longer payment may also be agreed. In the case of services, control is transferred over time. Consideration for the rendering of services to customers usually falls due for payment at the be/uni00AD ginning of a contract and is therefore deferred as a contract liability. The deferred amount is released over the service period and recognised as revenue in the income statement. As a rule, amounts are released on the basis of the expected expense trend, as this best reflects the performance of the service. If the sale of products includes a determinable amount for services (multiple/uni00ADcomponent contracts), the related revenues are deferred and recognised as income in the same way. Variable considera/uni00AD tion components, such as bonuses, are measured at the expect/uni00AD ed value, and in the case of multi/uni00ADcomponent contracts, allocated to all performance obligations unless directly attributable to the sale of a vehicle.\n\nRevenues from the sale of products, for which repurchase ar/uni00AD rangements are in place, are not recognised immediately in full. Instead, revenues are either recognised proportionately or the difference between the sales and repurchase price is recognised in instalments over the term of the contract depending on the nature of the agreement. In the case of vehicles sold to a deal/uni00AD ership that are expected to be repurchased in a subsequent pe/uni00AD riod as part of leasing operations, revenues are not recognised at Group level at the time of the sale of the vehicle. Instead, assets and liabilities relating to the right of return vehicles are recognised.\n\nRevenues from leases of own/uni00ADmanufactured vehicles are recog/uni00AD nised at Group level in accordance with the requirements for manufacturer or dealer leases. In the case of operating leases, revenues from lease payments are recognised on a straight/uni00ADline basis over the lease term.\n\nFinance leases, on the other hand, are accounted for as a sale. At the lease commencement date, revenues are is recognised at the amount of the fair value of the leased asset and reduced by any unguaranteed residual value of vehicles that are expected to be returned to the Group at the end of the lease term. In addition, initial direct costs are recognised as cost of sales at the lease commencement date.\n\nRevenues also include interest income from financial services. Interest income arising on finance leases as well as on retail customer and dealership financing is recognised using the effec/uni00AD tive interest method and reported as interest income on credit financing within revenues.\n\nPublic sector grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attaching to them have been com/uni00AD plied with and the grants will be received. The resulting income is recognised in cost of sales over the periods in which the costs occur that they are intended to compensate.\n\nEarnings per share are calculated as follows: Basic earnings per share are calculated for common and preferred stock by dividing the net profit for the year (after non/uni00ADcontrolling interests) that is attributable to each category of stock, by the average number of shares of each category in circulation. Net profit for the year is accordingly allocated to the different categories of stock. The portion of the net profit that is not being distributed is allocated to each category of stock based on the number of outstanding shares. Profits available for distribution are determined directly on the basis of the dividend proposals or resolutions for common and preferred stock. Diluted earnings per share are calculated and separately disclosed in accordance with IAS 33.\n\nIntangible assets are measured on initial recognition at acqui/uni00AD sition or manufacturing cost. Subsequently, intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight/uni00ADline basis over their useful lives of between three and 20 years. Impairment losses are recognised where necessary. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. Inter/uni00AD nally generated intangible assets mainly comprise development costs for vehicle, module and architecture projects.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalised if all of the criteria specified by IAS 38 are met. They are measured on the basis of direct costs and directly attributable overhead costs. Project/uni00ADrelated capital/uni00AD ised development costs are amortised on a straight/uni00ADline basis following the start of production over the estimated product life (usually five to twelve years).\n\nGoodwill arises when the cost of acquiring a business exceeds the Group's share of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identified during the acquisition.\n\nIntangible assets also include emission allowances and similar rights arising from programmes aimed at reducing carbon or other climate/uni00ADdamaging emissions (for example in conjunction with the EU Emissions Trading System or vehicle/uni00ADrelated emis/uni00AD sions regulations in the USA or China). These allowances and rights are carried at cost and, in the event that they are allocated free of charge, recorded at a value of zero. Amounts are derec/uni00AD ognised at the date of the return, sale or expiry of the allowances or rights. In parallel to the recognition of these allowances and rights as assets, provisions are recognised in accordance with IAS 37 corresponding to the amount of obligations expected to arise in conjunction with the related emission regulations. Pro/uni00AD visions are measured on the basis of the expected value of the allowances or rights that are to be returned.",

        "page_content": "If there is any indication of impairment of intangible assets , or if an annual impairment test is required (i.e. intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, intangible assets during the devel/uni00AD opment phase and goodwill), an impairment test is performed. Each individual asset is tested separately unless the cash flows generated by the asset are not sufficiently independent from the cash flows generated by other assets or other groups of assets. In these cases, impairment is tested at the level of a cash/uni00ADgen/uni00AD erating unit, which is the norm for the BMW Group.\n\nFor the purpose of the impairment test, the carrying amount of an asset (or a cash/uni00ADgenerating unit) is compared with the recov/uni00AD erable amount. The first step of the impairment test is to deter/uni00AD mine the value in use. If the value in use is lower than the carrying amount, the next step is to determine the fair value less costs to sell and compare the amount so determined with the asset's carrying amount. If the fair value is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised, reducing the carrying amount to the higher of the asset's value in use or fair value less costs to sell.\n\nIf the reason for a previously recognised impairment loss no longer exists, the impairment loss is reversed up to the level of the recoverable amount, but no higher than the amortised acqui/uni00AD sition or manufacturing cost. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.\n\nAs part of the process of assessing recoverability, it is generally necessary to apply estimations and assumptions - in particular regarding future cash inflows and outflows and the length of the forecast period - which could differ from actual amounts. Actual amounts may differ from the assumptions and estimations used if business conditions develop differently to expectations.\n\nThe BMW Group determines the value in use of intangible assets on the basis of a present value computation. The cash flows used for this calculation are derived from the long/uni00ADterm corporate plan approved by management, corresponding to a forecast period of six years. For the purposes of calculating cash flows beyond the planning period, a perpetual annuity return is assumed which does not take growth into account. Forecasting assumptions are adjusted to current information and regularly compared with ex/uni00AD ternal sources. The assumptions used take account in particular of expectations of the profitability of the product portfolio, future market share development, macroeconomic developments (such as currency, interest rate and raw materials prices) as well as the legal environment and past experience.\n\nAssumptions also take into account the impact of climate/uni00ADrelated aspects and the influence of other sustainability factors on busi/uni00AD ness performance and the product portfolio, for example as a result of changes in demand patterns, regulatory requirements or changes in production conditions. In line with the BMW Group's stated corporate strategies and the ongoing transformation to electromobility, the detailed forecast takes account of key as/uni00AD sumptions such as the planned increase in the share of electrified automobiles to over 50 % of total deliveries, the scale of invest/uni00AD ments in production facilities that will be required to achieve that target and the expected impact on the current leasing portfolio.\n\nAmounts are discounted on the basis of a market/uni00ADrelated cost of capital rate. Impairment tests are performed for accounting and financial reporting purposes for the Automotive excluding BMW Brilliance, BMW Brilliance and Motorcycles cash/uni00ADgenerating units using a risk/uni00ADadjusted pre/uni00ADtax cost of capital (WACC). In the case of the Financial Services cash/uni00ADgenerating unit, a pre/uni00AD tax cost of equity capital is used, as is customary in the sector. In light of the fact that acquisition of additional shares in BMW Brilliance took place during the year under report, the fair value\n\nless costs to sell of this cash/uni00ADgenerating unit was determined directly. This approach differs from value in use only in relation to the length of the detailed forecast period (which extends to the end of the joint venture contract in 2040) and the treatment of costs to sell. In the level hierarchy pursuant to IFRS 13, this measurement of fair value has been allocated to Level 3. The following pre/uni00ADtax discount factors were applied:\n\n-\n\n| in/uni00A0%        | 2022                                | 2021                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                    | /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/four.tf    | Automotive excluding BMW Brilliance /one.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/one.tf |\n| BMW Brilliance     | /one.tf/five.tf/period.tf/four.tf   |                                                                      |\n| Motorcycles        | /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/four.tf    | /one.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/one.tf                                     |\n| Financial Services | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                   |\n\nAn after/uni00ADtax discount rate of 11.5 % was used to determine the fair value less costs to sell of the BMW Brilliance cash/uni00ADgenerating unit (CGU).\n\nThe risk/uni00ADadjusted discount rate, calculated using a capital asset pricing model (CAPM), also takes into account specific peer/uni00AD group information relating to beta/uni00ADfactors, capital structure data and borrowing costs. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was not adjusted to take account of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.\n\nIn conjunction with the impairment tests for cash/uni00ADgenerating units, sensitivity analyses are performed for the main assumptions in order to rule out that possible changes to the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount would result in the requirement to recognise an impairment loss. Even in the case of a 10 % deterioration in the individual measurement assump/uni00AD tions, the need to recognise an impairment loss did not arise.",

This includes production/uni00ADrelated depreciation and amortisation as well as an appropriate proportion of administra/uni00AD tive and social costs. Financing costs are not included in acquisi/uni00AD tion or manufacturing cost unless they are directly attributable to the asset. The carrying amount of items of depreciable property, plant and equipment is written down according to scheduled usage/uni00ADbased depreciation - as a general rule on a straight/uni00ADline basis - over the useful lives of the assets. Depreciation is recorded as an expense in the income statement.\n\nThe following useful lives are applied throughout the BMW Group:\n\n| in years                                                                                                      |                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Factory and office buildings, residential buildings, fixed  installations in buildings and outside facilities | /eight.tf to /five.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Plant and machinery                                                                                           | /three.tf to /three.tf/zero.tf |\n| Other facilities, factory and office equipment                                                                | /two.tf to /two.tf/five.tf     |\n\nThe useful life of the plant and equipment is reviewed regularly and extended or shortened as necessary. This review also takes account of the impact of climate/uni00ADrelated aspects on useful lives, for example due to changes in demand patterns or regulatory requirements. This assessment is based on the assumptions used for long/uni00ADterm corporate planning purposes and product/uni00AD related decisions, as described above. Climate/uni00ADrelated  aspects have an indirect impact on the utilisation of property, plant and\n\nequipment. The useful lives of items of plant and machinery can be extended by a combination of flexible manufacturing arrange/uni00AD ments (independent of drivetrain type and capable of handling all vehicle generations) and sustainable asset/uni00ADpreservation measures. The useful lives of plant and machinery that are used exclusively for internal combustion vehicle production are also covered by up/uni00ADto/uni00ADdate planning assumptions. For machinery used in multiple/uni00ADshift operations, depreciation rates are increased to account for the additional utilisation. If there is any indication of impairment of property, plant and equipment, an impairment test is performed as described above for intangible assets.\n\nIn the case of leased items of property, plant and equipment , a right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse asset and a liability for the outstanding lease pay/uni00AD ments are recognised with effect from the date on which the leased asset becomes available for use by the BMW Group. The cost of the right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse asset is the sum of the amount at which the lease liability is initially measured, any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee and the estimated costs of disman/uni00AD tling, removing or restoring the leased asset. Lease incentives granted by the lessor are deducted. Right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse assets are de/uni00AD preciated on a straight/uni00ADline basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset and the expected lease term. If ownership of the leased asset is automatically transferred at the end of the lease term or the exercise of a purchase option is reflected in the lease payments, the right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse asset is amortised on a straight/uni00AD line basis over the expected useful life of the leased asset. Right/uni00AD of/uni00ADuse assets are reported in the balance sheet within the rele/uni00AD vant  line  items  for  property,  plant  and  equipment.  The depreciation expense on right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse assets is reported in the income statement in cost of sales as well as in selling and ad/uni00AD ministrative expenses.\n\nThe lease liability is measured on initial recognition at the pres/uni00AD ent value of the future lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced, without income statement impact, by the lease payments made. Lease liabilities are reported within financial liabilities, while interest expense is reported as part of net interest result. In the cash flow statement, both the repayment portion and the interest portion of lease pay/uni00AD ments are shown as cash outflows from financing activities.\n\nThe lease payments to be taken into account to measure the right/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse asset and the lease liability comprise fixed pay/uni00AD ments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or an interest rate as well as amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees. If it is reasonably certain that a pur/uni00AD chase or lease extension option will be exercised, the relevant payments are also included. Payments for periods for which the lessee has an option to terminate a lease unilaterally are only included in the lease payments if it is reasonably certain that the termination option will not be exercised. For the purposes of assessing options, the BMW Group takes account of all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise the option.\n\nIFRS 16 requires that lease payments are discounted as a gen/uni00AD eral rule using the interest rate implicit in the lease. However, since the interest rate in leases entered into by the BMW Group cannot readily be determined, amounts are discounted on the basis of the incremental borrowing rate, comprising the risk/uni00ADfree interest rate in the relevant currency for matching maturities plus a premium for the credit risk. Specific risks attached to an asset are generally not taken into account, given that collateral received in the context of alternative financing arrangements is not relevant within the BMW Group.",

        "page_content": "Determining which items are to be counted as lease payments including the issue of the lease term underlying those payments and which discount rate to apply involves using estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual outcomes.\n\nAs lessee, the BMW Group makes use of the application exemp/uni00AD tions available for short/uni00ADterm leases and leases of low/uni00ADvalue assets.\n\nThe BMW Group has not applied the exemptions available to lessees to account for COVID/uni00AD19/uni00ADrelated rent concessions (amendments to IFRS 16 dated 28 May 2020 and 31 March 2021).\n\nGroup products recognised by BMW Group entities as leased products under operating leases are measured at manufacturing cost and all other leased products at acquisition cost, in each case including initial direct costs. All leased products are depre/uni00AD ciated over the period of the lease using the straight/uni00ADline method down to their expected residual value.\n\nWhere the recoverable amount of a lease exceeds the asset's carrying amount, changes in residual value expectations are rec/uni00AD ognised by adjusting scheduled depreciation prospectively over the remaining term of the lease. If the recoverable amount is lower than the asset's carrying amount, an impairment loss is recog/uni00AD nised for the shortfall. A test is carried out at each balance sheet date to determine whether an impairment loss recognised in prior years no longer exists or has decreased. In such cases, the carry/uni00AD ing amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount, at a maximum up to the amount of the asset's amortised cost.\n\nAssumptions and estimations are required regarding future re/uni00AD sidual values, since these represent a significant part of future cash inflows. Relevant factors to be considered include the trend in market prices and demand on the pre/uni00ADowned automobile market. The expected change in the drive/uni00ADsystem mix going forward, which is subject to regular analysis, is also taken into account.\n\nThe BMW Group has developed and implemented methods and processes that enable sustainability aspects of residual value risks, particularly climate/uni00ADrelated aspects, to be appropriately assessed and managed. A scenario/uni00ADbased approach is applied to quantify the impact of the transition towards zero/uni00ADemission mobility and factor in the technological progress of the products involved, resulting potentially in the need to adjust the estimated residual values of both internal combustion and electrified vehi/uni00AD cles. However, the transition to new drive systems will stretch over a period of time. Under these circumstances, regulatory aspects, customer behaviour and the structure of the product range all have to be taken into account. To varying degrees, the aforementioned aspects will play a role in bringing about changes to the existing product portfolio over the coming years. The nature of these planned changes can already be anticipated today to some extent, highlighting potential, but calculable risks for future operations. Disproportionate risks are only likely to arise in the event of unexpected regulatory changes that would also be to the detriment of customers. In addition to these various consid/uni00AD erations, the vehicle portfolio subject to residual value risks is remeasured on a quarterly basis, allowing new aspects to be incorporated in the valuation at an early stage. In this event, it would also be possible to adjust valuations relevant for new busi/uni00AD ness, given that such valuations are subject to the same turn of events. The forecasting models used by the BMW Group are sub/uni00AD ject to regular review and can be supplemented where appropriate to include aspects relating to changes in the market.\n\nUsing this approach, upward or downward adjustments can be made to residual values on the basis of a range of scenario analyses. The assumptions are based on internally available historical data and current market data as well as on forecasts of external institutions. Furthermore, assumptions are regularly validated by comparison with external data. Certain types of con/uni00AD tracts require a high degree of judgement when deciding wheth/uni00AD er they give rise to operating leases or receivables from sales financing.\n\n## Investments accounted for using the equity method are\n\nmeasured - provided no impairment has been recognised - at cost of investment adjusted for the Group's share of earnings and changes in equity capital. If there is any indication that an investment is impaired, an impairment test is performed on the basis of the discounted cash flow method. An indicator exists, for example, in the event of a serious shortfall compared to budget, the loss of an active market or if funds are required to avoid insolvency.\n\nWith the exception of lease receivables, financial assets are measured on initial recognition at their fair value. Financial assets include in particular other investments, receivables from sales financing, marketable securities and investment funds, derivative financial assets, trade receivables and cash and cash equiva/uni00AD lents. As a general rule, initial recognition takes place as soon as the BMW Group becomes a party to a contract. In the case of so/uni00ADcalled 'regular way' purchases or sales of non/uni00ADderivative financial assets, initial recognition takes place at the settle/uni00AD ment date.\n\nDepending on the business model and the structure of contrac/uni00AD tual cash flows, financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, at fair value through comprehensive income or at fair value through profit or loss. The category 'measured at fair value through comprehensive income' at the BMW Group com/uni00AD prises mainly marketable securities and investment funds used for liquidity management purposes. Selected marketable secu/uni00AD rities and investment funds, money market funds within cash and cash equivalents as well as convertible bonds are recognised at fair value through profit or loss, as their contractual cash flows do not solely represent payments of principal and interest.",

Invest/uni00AD ments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associated com/uni00AD panies that are not material to the BMW Group are also included in other investments.\n\nReceivables from sales financing are measured as a general rule at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nReceivables from sales financing also include finance lease re/uni00AD ceivables which are measured at the amount of the net invest/uni00AD ment in the lease. This balance sheet line item also includes operating lease receivables at the end of the reporting period, while the related vehicles are reported as leased products.\n\nWith the exception of receivables from operating leases and trade receivables, the BMW Group applies the general approach de/uni00AD scribed in IFRS 9 to determine impairment of financial assets. Under the general approach, loss allowances are measured on initial recognition on the basis of the expected twelve/uni00ADmonth credit loss (stage 1). If the credit loss risk at the end of the re/uni00AD porting period has increased significantly since initial recognition, the impairment allowance is measured on the basis of lifetime expected credit losses (stage 2 - general approach). The meas/uni00AD urement of the change in default risk is based on a comparison\n\nof the default risk at the date of initial recognition and at the end of the reporting period. The default risk at the end of each report/uni00AD ing period is determined on the basis of credit checks, current key performance indicators and any overdue payments.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the simplified approach described in IFRS 9 to operating lease and trade receivables, whereby the amount of the loss allowance is measured subsequent to the initial recognition of the receivable on the basis of lifetime ex/uni00AD pected credit losses (stage 2 - simplified approach). For the purposes of allocating an item to stage 2, it is irrelevant whether the credit risk of the assets concerned has increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nAs a general rule, the BMW Group assumes that a receivable is in default if it is more than 90 days overdue or if there are objec/uni00AD tive indications of insolvency, such as the opening of insolvency proceedings. Credit/uni00ADimpaired assets are identified as such on the basis of this definition of default. In the case of credit/uni00ADimpaired assets which had not been credit/uni00ADimpaired at the time they were acquired or originated, an impairment allowance is recognised at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). This is the case regardless of whether the general or simplified approach is applied. In the case of stage 3 assets, interest in/uni00AD come is calculated on the asset's carrying amount less any impairment loss.\n\nIn addition, post/uni00ADmodel adjustments are recorded if the risk is not fully covered by the standard models.\n\nThe BMW Group derecognises financial assets when it has no reasonable expectation of recovery. This may be the case, for instance, if the debtor is deemed not to have sufficient assets or other sources of income to service the debt.\n\nLoss allowances relating to the balance sheet item 'Receivables from sales financing' are determined primarily on the basis of past experience with credit losses, current data on overdue re/uni00AD ceivables, rating classes and scoring information.\n\nForward/uni00ADlooking information (for instance forecasts of key per/uni00AD formance indicators) is also taken into account if, based on past experience, such indicators show a substantive correlation to actual credit losses.\n\nLoss allowances on trade receivables are determined primarily on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. Further/uni00AD more, both positive and negative economic scenarios are used alongside the latest forecasts of key performance indicators when determining the level of valuation allowances. These scenarios are based on local analyses and take into account, for example, anticipated political and economic developments.\n\nInput factors available on the market, such as ratings and prob/uni00AD abilities of default, are used to calculate valuation allowances for cash and cash equivalents, financial receivables, receivables from subsidiaries and receivables from companies in which an investment is held. In the case of marketable securities and in/uni00AD vestment funds, the BMW Group usually applies the option not to allocate financial assets with a low default risk to different stages. Accordingly, assets with an investment grade rating are always allocated to stage 1.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used within the BMW Group for hedging purposes in order to reduce currency, interest rate, fair value and market price risks. Derivative financial instru/uni00AD ments are recognised as of the trade date, measured at their fair value. Depending on their market value at measurement date, these financial instruments are reported in the balance sheet as financial assets or financial liabilities.",

        "page_content": "Fair values are determined on the basis of valuation models. Observable market price, tenor and currency basis spreads are taken into account in the measurement of derivative financial instruments. Furthermore, the Group's own credit risk and that of counterparties is taken into account on the basis of credit default swap values for market contracts with matching terms.\n\nThe BMW Group applies the option to recognise the credit risks arising from the fair values of a group of derivative financial assets and liabilities on the basis of their total net amount. Portfolio/uni00AD based valuation adjustments (credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments) to the individual derivative  financial assets and financial liabilities are allocated using the relative fair value approach (net method).\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, changes in fair value of de/uni00AD rivative financial instruments are presented as part of other financial result in the income statement or within other compre/uni00AD hensive income as a component of accumulated other equity, depending on whether the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\n\nFair value hedges are mainly used to hedge interest rate risks relating to financial liabilities. The currency basis is not designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of cross currency interest rate hedges accounted for as fair value hedges. Accord/uni00AD ingly, changes in the market value of such components are recorded as costs of hedging within accumulated other equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to other finan/uni00AD cial result within the income statement over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\nIn addition, for selected fixed/uni00ADinterest assets, a portion of the in/uni00AD terest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis in accordance with IAS 39. The designated hedged items (underlying transactions) are reported in the balance sheet as receivables from sales financ/uni00AD ing or financial liabilities. Interest rate risks are hedged on the basis of the present value of net cash flows relating to fixed  income assets (on the asset side) less cash flows relating to variable/uni00ADrate financing (on the liabilities side). The net cash flow determined in this way is hedged by purchasing corresponding interest rate swaps that have the effect of reducing the interest rate risk. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nFair value hedge ineffectiveness is generally recognised in other financial result.\n\nThe time values of option transactions and the interest compo/uni00AD nent - including the currency basis - of forward currency  contracts are not designated as part of the hedging relationship in the case of currency hedges accounted for as cash flow  hedges. Changes in the fair value of such components are  recorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulated other equity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other  equity from currency hedges are reclassified to cost of sales when the related hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nIn the case of raw materials hedges that are accounted for as cash flow hedges, the hedging instruments are designated in full as part of the hedging relationship. As an exception to this general rule, the interest component of raw materials derivative instruments redesignated in conjunction with the first/uni00ADtime application of IFRS 9 was not designated as part of the hedging relationship. Changes in the fair value of this component are re/uni00AD\n\ncorded as costs of hedging on a separate line within accumulat/uni00AD ed other equity. Amounts recorded in accumulated other  equity are included in the carrying amount of inventories on initial rec/uni00AD ognition.\n\nIneffectiveness arising on cash flow hedges is recognised directly in cost of sales, whereas the impact of prematurely terminated hedging relationships is recognised in other operating income and expenses.\n\nDeferred income taxes are recognised for all temporary differ/uni00AD ences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and lia/uni00AD bilities, including differences arising on consolidation procedures, as well as on unused tax losses and unused tax credits, when it is probable that they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or sub/uni00AD stantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed at each balance sheet date on the basis of planned taxable income in future financial years. If with a probability of more than 50 percent future tax benefits will not be realised, either in part or in total, a valuation allowance is recognised on the deferred tax assets. The calculation of deferred tax assets requires assumptions to be made with regard to the level of future taxable income and the timing of recovery of deferred tax assets. These assumptions take account of forecast operating results, announced legislative changes in connection with climate change and the impact on earnings of the reversal of taxable temporary differences. Since future business developments cannot be predicted with certain/uni00AD ty and to some extent cannot be influenced by the BMW Group, the measurement of deferred tax assets is subject to uncertainty.",

        "page_content": "Deferred tax liabilities on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated com/uni00AD panies as well as interests in joint arrangements are not recog/uni00AD nised if the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. This is particularly the case if it is intended that profits will not be distributed, but rather will be used to main/uni00AD tain the substance and expand the volume of business of the entities concerned.\n\nCurrent income taxes are calculated within the BMW Group on the basis of tax legislation applicable in the relevant countries. To the extent that judgement was necessary to determine the treatment and amount of tax items presented in the financial statements, there is in principle a possibility that local tax authorities may take a different position.\n\nAs a general rule, each income tax treatment is considered in/uni00AD dependently when accounting for uncertainties in income taxes . If it is not considered probable that an income tax treatment will be accepted by the local tax authorities, the BMW Group uses the most likely amount of the tax treatment when determining taxable profit and the tax base.\n\nInventories of raw materials, supplies and goods for resale are stated at the lower of average acquisition cost and net realisable value.\n\nWork in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of manufacturing cost and net realisable value. Manufacturing cost comprises all costs which are directly attributable to the manu/uni00AD facturing process as well as an appropriate proportion of pro/uni00AD duction/uni00ADrelated overheads. This includes production/uni00ADrelated depreciation and amortisation and an appropriate proportion of administrative and social costs. Financing costs are not included in the acquisition or manufacturing cost of inventories.\n\nInventories also include vehicles held for sale in the financial services business, measured at their amortised cost or lower net realisable value.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise mainly cash on hand and cash at bank with an original term of up to three months. With the exception of money market funds, cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortised cost.\n\nFinancial liabilities , with the exception of lease liabilities, are measured on first/uni00ADtime recognition at their fair value. For these purposes, transaction costs are taken into account except in the case of financial liabilities allocated to the category 'measured at fair value through profit or loss'. Subsequent to initial recog/uni00AD nition, liabilities are - with the exception of derivative financial instruments - measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nProvisions for pensions are measured using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, not only obligations relating to known vested benefits at the reporting date are recognised, but also the effect of future expected increases in pensions and salaries. The calculation is based on independent actuarial valuations which take into account the relevant biometric factors.\n\nIn the case of funded plans, the pension obligation is offset against plan assets measured at their fair value. If the plan assets exceed the pension obligation, the surplus is tested for recover/uni00AD ability. In the event that the BMW Group has a right of reimburse/uni00AD ment or a right to reduce future contributions, it reports an asset (within Other financial assets), measured on the basis of the present value of the future economic benefits attached to the plan assets. For funded plans, in cases where the obligation exceeds plan assets, a liability is recognised under pension pro/uni00AD visions.\n\nThe calculation of the amount of the provision requires assump/uni00AD tions to be made with regard to discount rates, pension trends, employee fluctuation and the life expectancy of employees, among other things. Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality fixed/uni00ADinterest corporate bonds.\n\nNet interest expense on the net defined benefit liability or net interest income on the net defined benefit assets are presented separately within the financial result. All other costs relating to allocations to pension provisions are allocated to costs by function in the income statement.\n\nPast service cost arises where a BMW Group company introduces a defined benefit plan or changes the benefits payable under an existing plan. This cost is recognised immediately in the income statement. Similarly, gains and losses arising on the settlement of a defined benefit plan are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nRemeasurement of the net liability can result from changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the fair value of the plan assets or the asset ceiling. Remeasurement can re/uni00AD sult, amongst others, from changes in financial and demographic parameters, as well as changes following the portfolio develop/uni00AD ment. Remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income and ultimately in equity (within revenue reserves).\n\nOther provisions are recognised when the BMW Group has a present legal or factual obligation towards a third party arising from past events, the settlement of which is probable and when the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Provisions with a remaining period of more than one year are measured at their net present value.",

        "page_content": "The measurement of provisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatu/uni00AD tory warranty obligations (statutory, contractual and volun/uni00AD tary) involves estimations. In addition to manufacturer warran/uni00AD ties prescribed by law, the BMW Group offers various further standard (assurance/uni00ADtype) warranties depending on the product and sales market. No provisions are recognised for additionally offered service packages that are treated as separate perfor/uni00AD mance obligations.\n\nProvisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranties are recog/uni00AD nised at the point in time when control over the goods is trans/uni00AD ferred to the dealership or retail customer or when it is decided to introduce new warranty measures. With respect to the level of the provision, estimations are made in particular based on past experience of damage claims and processes. Future potential repair costs and price increases per product and market are also taken into account. Provisions for warranties for all companies of the BMW Group are adjusted regularly to take account of new information, with the impact of any changes recognised in the income statement. Further information is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A035 . Similar estimates are also made in conjunction with the meas/uni00AD urement of expected reimbursement claims.\n\nThe recognition and measurements of provisions for litigation and liability risks necessitates making assumptions in order to determine the probability of liability, the amount of claim and the duration of the legal dispute. The assumptions made, especially the assumption about the outcome of legal proceedings, are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The appropriateness of assumptions is regularly reviewed, based on assessments un/uni00AD dertaken both by management and external experts, such as lawyers. If new developments arise in the future that result in a different assessment, provisions are adjusted accordingly.\n\nIf the recognition criteria relevant for provisions are not fulfilled and the outflow of resources on fulfilment is not unlikely, the potential obligation is disclosed as a contingent liability .\n\nRelated party disclosures comprise information on associated companies, joint ventures and non/uni00ADconsolidated subsidiaries as well as individuals which have the ability to exercise a controlling or significant influence over the financial and operating policies of the BMW Group. This includes all persons in key positions of the Company, as well as close members of their families or inter/uni00AD mediary entities.\n\nIn the case of the BMW Group, this also applies to members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board.

The expense is recognised as personnel expense in the income statement over the vesting period and presented in the balance sheet as a provision.\n\nThe share/uni00ADbased remuneration programme for Board of Man/uni00AD agement members and senior heads of department entitles BMW AG to elect whether to settle its commitments in cash or with shares of BMW AG common stock. Based on the decision to settle in cash, the share/uni00ADbased remuneration programmes for Board of Management members and senior heads of department are accounted for as cash/uni00ADsettled, share/uni00ADbased remuneration programmes.

This in/uni00AD cludes one tax loss carryforward amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0416/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0413/uni00A0million), on which a valuation allowance of \u20ac/uni00A0141/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0140/uni00A0million) was recognised on the related deferred tax asset. The decrease in tax loss carryforwards was mainly due to the partial utilisation of loss carryforwards at the level of Group entities in the USA and the further utilisation of tax start/uni00ADup losses relating to San Luis Potos\u00ed plant in Mexico, opened in 2019.\n\nFor entities with tax losses available for carryforward, a net sur/uni00AD plus of deferred tax assets over deferred tax liabilities is reported at 31 December 2022 amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0 2,196/uni00A0 million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A02,487/uni00A0million). The basis for the recognition of deferred taxes is the BMW Group business model or management's assessment that there is material evidence that the entities will generate future taxable profit, against which deductible temporary differ/uni00AD ences can be offset.\n\nLoss  carryforwards  amounting  to  \u20ac/uni00A0 523/uni00A0 million  (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0 3,834/uni00A0million) can be used indefinitely, while \u20ac/uni00A0188/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0304/uni00A0million) expire after more than three years.\n\nCapital losses available for carryforward in the UK which do not relate to ongoing operations decreased to \u20ac/uni00A01,856/uni00A0million due to exchange rate factors (2021: \u20ac/uni00A01,959/uni00A0million). As in previous years, deferred tax assets recognised on these tax losses amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0464/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0490/uni00A0million) were fully written down since they can only be utilised against future cap/uni00AD ital gains.\n\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are netted for each relevant tax entity if they relate to the same tax authorities.\n\nDeferred taxes recognised directly in equity amounted to \u20ac/uni00A01, 214/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A01,733/uni00A0million).\n\n-\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million                                                                                                        | 2022                                        | 2021                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Deferred taxes at 1 January (assets (+) / liabilities (-))                                                                        | /seven.tf/four.tf/four.tf                   | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/five.tf/zero.tf    |\n| Deferred tax expense (-) / income (+) recognised through income statement                                                         | /one.tf/four.tf/two.tf                      | - /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/five.tf |\n| Change in deferred taxes recognised directly in equity                                                                            | - /five.tf/one.tf/nine.tf                   | /two.tf/three.tf                            |\n| thereof relating to fair value gains and losses on financial instruments and marketable securities recognised  directly in equity | - /one.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf                   | /two.tf/four.tf/seven.tf                    |\n| thereof relating to the remeasurements of net liabilities for defined benefit pension plans                                       | - /three.tf/two.tf/six.tf                   | - /two.tf/five.tf/zero.tf                   |\n| thereof from currency translation                                                                                                 | - /three.tf                                 | /two.tf/six.tf                              |\n| Effects in connection with the first/uni00ADtime consolidation of BMW Brilliance                                                  | - /one.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/one.tf/two.tf   |                                             |\n| Exchange rate impact and other changes                                                                                            | - /six.tf/two.tf                            | - /one.tf/four.tf/four.tf                   |\n| Deferred taxes at 31 December (assets (+) / liabilities (-))                                                                      | - /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf | /seven.tf/four.tf/four.tf                   |\n\nThe effects in connection with the first/uni00ADtime consolidation of BMW Brilliance gave rise primarily to net deferred tax liabilities relating to the remeasurement of the assets acquired and liabil/uni00AD ities assumed as part of the purchase price allocation.\n\nNo deferred taxes are recognised on taxable temporary differ/uni00AD ences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associated com/uni00AD panies and joint ventures if the BMW Group is able determine the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future, in particular in view of the fact that there is no intention to distribute the profits, but rather to use them to maintain substance and reinvest in the companies concerned. Temporary differences of this kind, for which no deferred taxes were  recognised,  amounted  to  \u20ac/uni00A0 32,882/uni00A0 million  (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0 25,526/uni00A0million). No computation was made of the potential impact of income taxes on the grounds of proportionality.\n\nDeferred  tax  liabilities  on  expected  dividends  amount  to \u20ac/uni00A0199/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A079/uni00A0million) and related primarily to divi/uni00AD dends from foreign subsidiaries.\n\nThe tax returns of BMW Group entities are checked regularly by German and foreign tax authorities. Taking account of numerous factors - including interpretations, commentaries and legal de/uni00AD cisions relating to the various tax jurisdictions as well as past experience - adequate provision has been made, to the extent identifiable and probable, for potential future tax obligations.",

Also in/uni00AD cluded are subsidies for tool costs, licences, purchased develop/uni00AD ment projects, emission allowances, software and purchased customer bases.\n\nOther intangible assets include brand/uni00ADname rights amounting to \u20ac/uni00A095/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A043/uni00A0million) which are allocated to the Auto/uni00AD motive segment and are not subject to scheduled amortisation since their useful life is deemed to be indefinite. The brand/uni00ADname rights are, to an extent, subject to a limited right of ownership. Intangible assets also include goodwill of \u20ac/uni00A033/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A033/uni00A0million) allocated to the Automotive excluding BMW Bril/uni00AD liance cash/uni00ADgenerating unit (CGU) and goodwill of \u20ac/uni00A0347/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0347/uni00A0million) allocated to the Financial Services CGU. Goodwill was recognised in conjunction with the business com/uni00AD bination with BMW Brilliance during the/uni00A0year under report and allocated to the new BMW Brilliance CGU within the Automotive segment. The carrying amount at 31/uni00A0December 2022 stood at \u20ac/uni00A01,182/uni00A0million.\n\nFurther information on additions from business acquisitions is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A03 .\n\nAs in the previous year, there was no requirement to recognise impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses on intangible assets in 2022.\n\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a cost component of intangible assets in 2022.\n\n## 23   Property, plant and equipment (including right/uni00ADof/uni00AD use assets arising from leasing)\n\nNo impairment losses were recognised in 2022, as in the previ/uni00AD ous year.\n\nAs in the previous year, no financing costs were recognised as a cost component of property, plant and equipment in 2022.\n\nRight/uni00ADof/uni00ADuse assets arising from leases of land and buildings relate primarily to logistics and office premises and, to a lesser extent, to selling and production premises. In order to secure these premises and, in the interests of flexibility, the property rental agreements concerned often contain extension and ter/uni00AD mination options.\n\nThe regular review of the useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment subject to systematic depreciation takes into account the assumptions contained in the long/uni00ADterm corporate plan, and hence the ongoing transformation towards electromo/uni00AD bility as well as the associated short/uni00AD and medium/uni00ADterm impact on the product portfolio. In 2022, that review resulted in some useful lives being reassessed and extended accordingly, giving rise to a positive effect of \u20ac/uni00A0524/uni00A0million in the form of lower de/uni00AD preciation.\n\nMoreover, a large volume of fully depreciated tools was derecog/uni00AD nised, as a result of which disposals of historical cost and accu/uni00AD mulated depreciation - as reported in the analysis of changes in tangible assets - increased year on year.\n\n## 24  Leased products\n\nMinimum lease payments of non/uni00ADcancellable operating leases amounting to \u20ac/uni00A021,408/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A023,026/uni00A0million) fall due as follows:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million                | 31. 12. 2022                                                                                     | 31. 12. 2021                 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                           | /nine.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/zero.tf/six.tf /one.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/two.tf/three.tf          | within one year              |\n|                                           | /six.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/two.tf/two.tf /seven.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/two.tf                 | between one and two years    |\n| /three.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/six.tf/five.tf | /three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/one.tf/two.tf                                                        | between two and three years  |\n| /one.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/one.tf/two.tf    | /one.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf/two.tf                                                         | between three and four years |\n| /two.tf/six.tf/five.tf                    | /three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf                                                                         | between four and five years  |\n| later than five years                     | /three.tf/eight.tf /three.tf/five.tf                                                             |                              |\n|                                           | /two.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf /two.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/six.tf | Minimum lease payments       |\n\nImpairment losses amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0527/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0338/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion) were recognised on leased products in 2022 as a conse/uni00AD quence of changes in residual value expectations.

Preferred stock, to which no voting rights are attached, bears an additional dividend of \u20ac/uni00A00.02 per share.\n\nIn the financial year 2022, a total of 1,439,975 shares of preferred stock was sold to employees at a reduced price of \u20ac/uni00A059.06 per share in conjunction with an Employee Share Programme. These shares are entitled to receive dividends for the first time with effect from the financial year 2023.\n\nIssued share capital increased by \u20ac/uni00A01.4/uni00A0million as a result of the issue to employees of 1,439,975 new shares of non/uni00ADvoting pre/uni00AD ferred stock. BMW AG is authorised up to 15 May 2024 to issue 5/uni00A0million shares of non/uni00ADvoting preferred stock amounting to nom/uni00AD inal \u20ac/uni00A05.0/uni00A0million. At the end of the reporting period, 0.3/uni00A0million of these amounting to nominal \u20ac/uni00A00.3/uni00A0million remained available for issue.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves include premiums arising from the issue of shares and totalled \u20ac/uni00A02,432 million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A02,325/uni00A0million). The change amounting to \u20ac/uni00A0107/uni00A0million related to the share capital increase in conjunction with the issue of shares of preferred stock to employees.\n\n## Revenue reserves\n\nRevenue reserves comprise the non/uni00ADdistributed earnings of com/uni00AD panies consolidated in the Group Financial Statements. In addi/uni00AD tion, remeasurements of the net defined benefit obligation for pension plans are also presented in revenue reserves.\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board propose that the unappropriated profit of BMW AG for the financial year 2022 amounting to \u20ac/uni00A05.5 billion be utilised to pay a dividend of \u20ac/uni00A0 8.52 for each share of preferred stock entitled to receive a dividend, and a dividend of \u20ac/uni00A08.50 for each share of common stock entitled to receive a dividend, and that the remaining amount be transferred to revenue reserves. Based on the number of shares at 31 December 2022 entitled to receive a dividend, the proposed dividend represents a total payout of \u20ac/uni00A05.5 billion.\n\nThe proposal for the appropriation of profit takes into account treasury shares held at 31 December 2022 which are not entitled to receive a dividend.\n\nThe number of shares entitled to receive a dividend may change prior to the Annual General Meeting. In this case, based on an unchanged distribution per share of common and preferred stock\n\nentitled to receive a dividend, a correspondingly amended reso/uni00AD lution concerning the appropriation of profit will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe proposed distribution was not recognised as a liability in the Group Financial Statements.\n\n## Accumulated other equity\n\nAccumulated other equity comprises amounts recognised direct/uni00AD ly in equity resulting from the translation of the financial state/uni00AD ments of foreign subsidiaries, changes in the fair value of deriv/uni00AD ative financial instruments and marketable securities, costs of hedging recognised directly in equity as well the related deferred taxes.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of BMW AG on 11 May 2022, the shareholders authorised the Board of Management to acquire treasury shares via the stock exchange, up to a maximum of 10 % of the share capital in place at the date of the resolution and to withdraw those shares from circulation without any further res/uni00AD olution by the Annual General Meeting.

The programme was launched on 1 July 2022 and is scheduled to be completed by no later than 31 December 2023.\n\nDuring the period from 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022, BMW AG repurchased 15,312,007/uni00A0shares of common stock for \u20ac/uni00A01,172/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion and 1,448,950/uni00A0shares of preferred stock for \u20ac/uni00A0106/uni00A0million, all of which are now reported as treasury shares.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, BMW AG therefore held a total of 16,760,957/uni00A0treasury shares, corresponding to a nominal amount of \u20ac/uni00A016,760,957 or 2.53 % of BMW AG's share capital. 1\n\n## Capital management disclosures\n\nThe BMW Group's objectives with regard to capital management are to safeguard over the long/uni00ADterm the Group's ability to con/uni00AD tinue as a going concern and to provide an adequate return to shareholders.\n\nThe capital structure is managed in order to meet needs arising from changes in economic conditions and the risks of the under/uni00AD lying assets.\n\nThe BMW Group is not subject to any unified external minimum equity capital requirements. Within the Financial Services seg/uni00AD ment, however, there are a number of individual entities which are subject to equity capital requirements of relevant regulatory banking authorities.\n\nIn order to manage its capital structure, the BMW Group uses various instruments, including the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and share buybacks. Moreover, the BMW Group actively manages debt capital, carrying out funding activities with a target debt structure in mind.\n\nA key aspect in the selection of financial instruments is the ob/uni00AD jective to achieve matching maturities for the Group's financing requirements. In order to reduce non/uni00ADsystematic risk, the BMW Group uses a variety of financial instruments available on the world's capital markets to achieve diversification.\n\nThe capital structure at the end of the reporting period was as follows:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million                     | 31. 12. 2021                                               |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of  BMW AG | /seven.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/six.tf/six.tf          |\n| Proportion of total capital                    | /four.tf/one.tf/period.tf/eight.tf %                       |\n| Non/uni00ADcurrent financial liabilities       | /six.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/four.tf/two.tf            |\n| Current financial liabilities                  | /four.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/two.tf/one.tf              |\n| Total financial liabilities                    | /one.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/six.tf/three.tf  |\n| Proportion of total capital                    | /five.tf/eight.tf/period.tf/two.tf %                       |\n| Total capital                                  | /one.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/nine.tf |\n\nEquity attributable to shareholders of BMW AG increased during the financial year by 17.2 %, primarily reflecting the increase in revenue reserves.\n\n## 33  Non/uni00ADcontrolling interests\n\nThe 25 % non/uni00ADcontrolling interests of other shareholders in the subsidiary BMW Brilliance represent a significant item in the BMW Group's balance sheet. At the date of acquisition (11 Feb/uni00AD ruary 2022), the direct non/uni00ADcontrolling interests in BMW Brilliance were measured at \u20ac/uni00A04,574/uni00A0million.

Defined benefit plans may be covered by provisions or pension assets. In Germany, pension obligations of the BMW Group are almost entirely covered by assets transferred to BMW Trust e.V., Munich (BMW Trust), in conjunction with a Contractual Trust Arrangement (CTA) (funded plan). In addition, funded plans also exist in the UK as well as in the USA, Switzerland, Belgium and\n\nJapan. In the meantime, all of the main defined benefit plans have been closed for new entrants and replaced by defined con/uni00AD tribution plans.\n\nThe assumptions stated below, which depend on the economic situation in the relevant country, are used to measure the defined benefit obligation of each pension plan.

Benefits paid in conjunction with these plans comprise old/uni00ADage retirement pensions as well as invalidity and surviving dependents' benefits. The level of ongoing pension payments is adjusted in accordance with \u00a7 16 of the Company Pensions Act (Betriebsrentengesetz).\n\nThe defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants since 2014. Defined contribution plans with a minimum rate of return, comprising employer/uni00AD and employee/uni00ADfunded components, con/uni00AD tinue to exist. The fact that the plan involves a minimum rate of return means that the defined contribution entitlements are clas/uni00AD sified in accordance with IAS 19 as defined benefit plans. In 2021, employees in the defined benefit plan were given the option to\n\nswitch to the defined contribution plan. In the case of defined benefit plans involving the payment of a pension, the amount of benefits to be paid is determined by multiplying a fixed amount by the number of years of service.\n\nThe assets of the German pension plans are invested by BMW Trust (a German association) in accordance with a CTA. The rep/uni00AD resentative bodies of the association are the Board of Directors and the Members' General Meeting. BMW Trust currently has seven members and three members of the Board of Directors elected by the Members' General Meeting. The Board of Directors is responsible for investments, drawing up and deciding on in/uni00AD vestment guidelines as well as monitoring compliance with those guidelines. The members of the association can be employees, employee representatives, senior executives and members of the Board of Management of BMW AG. An ordinary Members' Gen/uni00AD eral Meeting takes place once every calendar year, and deals with a range of matters, including receiving and approving the\n\nassociation's annual report, ratifying the activities of the Board of Directors and adopting changes to the association's statutes.\n\n## UK\n\nDefined benefit plans exist in the UK which are closed for all plan participants. Vested benefits remain in place. New benefits are covered by contributions made to a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are administered by BMW Pension Trustees Limited, Farnborough, and BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farnborough, both trustee companies which act inde/uni00AD pendently of the BMW Group. BMW (UK) Trustees Limited, Farn/uni00AD borough, is represented by ten trustees and BMW Pension Trus/uni00AD tees Limited, Farnborough, by five trustees. A minimum of one third of the trustees must be elected by plan participants. The trustees represent the interests of plan participants and decide on investment strategies. Funding contributions to the funds are determined in agreement with the BMW Group.",

The fixed amounts to which employees were previously entitled in the defined ben/uni00AD efit plan remain unchanged going forward and therefore resulted in a plan amendment in accordance with IAS 19. Also in 2021, the previous pension entitlement trend (Festbetragstrend) was con/uni00AD verted - with the exception of one remaining component - into\n\na career trend. Furthermore, an employee switching to the defined contribution plan received an entitlement deemed to be equivalent in legal terms to their previous rights.\n\nThis gave rise in the financial year 2021 to an overall positive impact of \u20ac/uni00A0562/uni00A0million on past service cost, which was recog/uni00AD nised in the income statement, primarily in the form of reduc/uni00AD tions to cost of sales as well as to selling and administrative expenses.\n\nDue to the fact that there is no right of reimbursement or right to reduce future contributions to the fund, the amount of plan assets reported for the UK pension plan has been limited to the amount of the obligations.\n\nDepending on the cash flow profile and risk structure of the pen/uni00AD sion obligations involved, plan assets relating to defined benefit plans are invested in a diversified portfolio.",

Plan assets of the BMW Group include own transferable financial instruments amounting to \u20ac/uni00A07/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A02/uni00A0million).\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to risks arising both from defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans with a minimum return guarantee. The discount rates used to calculate pension obligations are subject to market fluctuations and therefore in/uni00AD fluence the level of the obligations. Furthermore, changes in other actuarial parameters, such as expected rates of inflation, also have an impact on pension obligations. In order to reduce currency exposures, a substantial portion of plan assets is either invested in the same currency as the underlying plan or hedged by means of currency derivatives. As part of the internal reporting procedures and for internal management purposes, financial risks relating to the pension plans are reported using a value/uni00ADat/uni00AD risk approach by reference to the pension deficit. The investment strategy is also subject to regular review together with external consultants, with the aim of ensuring that investments are struc/uni00AD tured to match the timing of pension payments and the expected development of pension obligations. In this way, fluctuations in pension provisions recognised in the balance sheet are reduced.",

Warranty provisions include amounts recognised in connection with the exhaust gas recirculation cooler. Expected reimburse/uni00AD ment claims at 31 December 2022 amounted to \u20ac/uni00A0872/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A01,112/uni00A0million) and are disclosed within other assets (see /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A029 ). The higher amount of additions compared to the fi/uni00AD nancial year 2021 was mainly due to additions relating to the exhaust gas recirculation cooler, inflation/uni00ADinduced increases to a variety of provisions and the full consolidation of BMW Brilliance.\n\nProvisions for obligations for personnel and social expenses comprise mainly obligations relating to performance/uni00ADrelated remuneration components, workforce measures as well as pre/uni00AD retirement part/uni00ADtime working arrangements and long/uni00ADservice awards.\n\nThe provisions for other obligations cover numerous specific risks and uncertain obligations, in particular for litigation and liability risks. Further information on the reversal of the provision relating to EU Commission antitrust proceedings was provided in /uni2197 note/uni00A010 to the BMW Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2021 included in the BMW Group Report 2021.\n\nOther obligations for ongoing operational expenses include in particular expected payments for dealer bonuses and other price deductions.\n\n## 36  Income tax liabilities\n\nCurrent income tax liabilities totalling \u20ac/uni00A01,224/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0921/uni00A0million) include \u20ac/uni00A058/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A044/uni00A0million) which are expected to be settled after more than twelve months. Liabilities may be settled earlier than this depending on the timing of the underlying proceedings.",

This assessment may change over time and is adjusted regularly on the basis of new information and circumstances. A part of the risks is covered by insurance.\n\nThe EU Commission's antitrust proceedings were settled on 8/uni00A0July 2021 (see /uni2197/uni00A0note/uni00A010 to the BMW Group Financial Statements for the financial year 2021 included in the BMW Group Report 2021).\n\nIn addition, respective antitrust proceedings were opened against BMW AG by the Chinese State Administration for Market Regu/uni00AD lation in March 2019 and the Korea Fair Trade Commission in May 2020. Possible risks for the BMW Group in connection with the antitrust proceedings in China cannot be currently foreseen, neither in terms of their outcome nor the amounts involved. The South Korean antitrust authority decided at the beginning of 2023 to  terminate the proceedings by imposing a fine.\n\nIn relation to these allegations, numerous class action lawsuits have been brought in the USA and Canada as well as several individual customers' lawsuits in South Korea. In the USA, the customer class actions were withdrawn and the dealer class action was dismissed. The class action lawsuits in Canada and individual customers'  lawsuits in South Korea remain at an  early stage. Further civil lawsuits based on the allegations are possible going forward. Further  disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nRegulatory authorities have ordered the BMW Group to recall various vehicle models in conjunction with airbags supplied by the Takata group of companies. Provision for the costs involved has been recognised within warranty provisions. In addition to the risks already covered by warranty provisions, it cannot be ruled out that further vehicles of the BMW Group will be affected by future recall actions. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nOn 22 January 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis/uni00AD sion (SEC) opened an investigation into possible violations of U.S. securities laws by the BMW Group relating to disclosures regard/uni00AD ing the BMW Group's unit sales of new vehicles. This matter was settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the allegations, and the BMW Group consented to the entry of an Order finding violations of the U. S. Securities Act and agreed to pay a penalty of US $ 18/uni00A0million. Following the SEC Order, Certain BMW Group entities and their officers became defendants in private securities litigation. The claimants withdrew the claim against the individ/uni00AD ual defendants voluntarily without prejudice. The remaining par/uni00AD ties reached an agreement to settle the action for a settlement amount of US $ 1.75/uni00A0million. This settlement has been approved by the court on 21 December 2022, which concludes this civil proceeding.\n\nSeveral BMW Group entities are facing a number of diesel emissions/uni00ADrelated court claims in England. The claimants have applied for a group litigation order. Given that the proceedings are still at an early stage, the probability, amount or timing of any liablity is not practical to be estimated at present. Further disclo/uni00AD sures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.",

        "page_content": "In March 2022, the European Commission (EC) conducted in/uni00AD spections at the premises of automobile manufacturers and as/uni00AD sociations located in several member states. In parallel, the EC sent out formal requests for information to several automobile manufacturers, including BMW AG. The inspections and requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the col/uni00AD lection, treatment and recovery of end/uni00ADof/uni00ADlife vehicles and light commercial vehicles. The inspections were conducted in coordi/uni00AD nation with the UK Competition and Markets Authority, which has initiated formal proceedings in respect of the UK market. Appro/uni00AD priate risk provisions were recognised in the second quarter 2022 in connection with these investigations. Due to the early stage of the investigations, further risks for the BMW Group in con/uni00AD nection with the proceedings of the two authorities cannot be quantified at present. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\nFollowing a request for legal assistance from the Korean author/uni00AD ities in 2020 in connection with leaks in exhaust gas recirculation modules in BMW Group vehicles, the Munich public prosecutor's office initiated an investigation and searched BMW Group offices in Munich and Steyr in June 2022. The ongoing investigations by the authorities have never referred to the allegation of the use of illegal defeat devices. This was also not the subject of the search conducted in June 2022. Potential risks for the BMW Group cannot be quantified at the present time. Further disclosures pursuant to IAS 37.86 cannot be provided at present.\n\n## Other financial commitments\n\nIn addition to liabilities, provisions and contingent liabilities, the following commitments exist for the BMW Group at the end of the reporting period:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million                              | 31. 12. 2022                                | 31. 12. 2021                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Purchase commitments for property,  plant and equipment | /five.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/eight.tf | /three.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf |\n| Purchase commitments for  intangible assets             | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/one.tf/two.tf      | /two.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf     |",

For the purposes of fair value measurement using the discounted cash flow method, expected future cash flows are discounted on the basis of up/uni00ADto/uni00ADdate interest rate curves observable on the market.\n\nThe fair values of receivables from sales financing are measured using the discounted cash flow method, taking into account customer/uni00ADspecific credit risk. In view of the fact that these allow/uni00AD ances are calculated in part on the basis of internal information, receivables from sales financing are allocated to Level 3 in the level hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13.\n\nThe fair values of the financial assets shown in the table exist with financial institutions and are also measured using the dis/uni00AD counted cash flow method, taking into account the risk of default. Given that these financial institutions all have excellent credit ratings, the risk of default is low and can be observed on the market. The fair values of these items are therefore allocated to Level 2.\n\nIn the case of financial liabilities, own credit risk is taken into account based on credit default swaps available on the market, so that the fair values of these items are also allocated to Level 2.\n\nFor all other financial instruments not listed here that are meas/uni00AD ured at amortised cost, the carrying amount corresponds to the fair value. For this reason, they are not presented separately.\n\n|                                                                 | 31. 12. 2022                                      | 31. 12. 2022                                        | 31. 12. 2021                                      | 31. 12. 2021                                      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million                                      | Fair value                                        | Carrying  amount                                    | Fair value                                        | Carrying  amount                                  |\n| Receivables from sales financing - credit financing             | /six.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/three.tf/seven.tf | /six.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf | /six.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/five.tf/eight.tf | /six.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf/five.tf |\n| Receivables from sales financing - finance and operating leases | /two.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf    | /two.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf     | /two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/seven.tf/five.tf  | /two.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/two.tf/two.tf      |\n| Financial assets - Marketable securities and investment funds   | -                                                 | -                                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf                                   | /two.tf/zero.tf                                   |\n| Financial liabilities                                           |                                                   |                                                     |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Bonds                                                           | /four.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /four.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/four.tf   | /five.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/two.tf  | /five.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/nine.tf/eight.tf |\n| Asset/uni00ADbacked financing transactions                      | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/four.tf/two.tf  | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/four.tf/six.tf   | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/zero.tf/two.tf    | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/six.tf/two.tf   |\n| Liabilities from customer deposits (banking)                    | /one.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/three.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/one.tf/one.tf       | /one.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/three.tf/two.tf  | /one.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf/two.tf   |\n| Liabilities to banks                                            | /seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/zero.tf/two.tf        | /seven.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/five.tf/five.tf           | /nine.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf        | /nine.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf        |",

The fair values of these financial instruments are shown in the following table:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million             | Fair value 31. 12. 2022    | Fair value  31. 12. 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Unquoted equity instruments            | /eight.tf/three.tf/nine.tf | /seven.tf/two.tf/four.tf   |\n| Convertible bonds                      | /eight.tf                  | /two.tf/three.tf           |\n| Options on unquoted equity instruments | /two.tf                    | -                          |\n| Derivative instruments                 | -                          | /six.tf/seven.tf           |\n\nFinancial instruments allocated to Level 3 relate mainly to invest/uni00AD ments in a private/uni00ADequity fund. The valuation of unlisted equity instruments is determined primarily using the market/uni00ADbased approach. In particular, the financing rounds that take place within the private equity sector - usually on a regular basis at intervals of approximately 12 to 24 months - represent a significant input factor for these purposes. In addition, the investment ad/uni00AD visor provides the external fund manager with relevant, invest/uni00AD ment/uni00ADspecific information on an ongoing basis (at least quarterly). The latter subsequently assesses the underlying individual com/uni00AD panies in accordance with the guidelines for International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuations (IPEV).\n\nAs part of the process of analysing valuations, the external fund manager reviews the investment/uni00ADspecific milestones, including an analysis of financial, technical and liquidity/uni00ADspecific perfor/uni00AD mance indicators. Based on this analysis, it is considered whether the price of the most recent financing round is acceptable as a reasonable market valuation, in particular for early/uni00ADstage or growth/uni00ADphase investments. Key performance indicators used for the purpose of milestone analysis are highly dependent on the business model underlying the investment. Typical technical key performance indicators relate to licenses and patents held, the stage of technology development such as evidence of feasibility and prototypes, market entries, customer and user growth and appointments to key management positions. Key financial per/uni00AD formance indicators used are revenues, EBITDA and the corre/uni00AD sponding growth rate and / or development of specific contribution margins. Key liquidity/uni00ADspecific performance indicators are cash on hand, cash burn rates and prospects for future financing rounds.\n\nSince the pricing from the financing rounds is considered to be the decisive input factor for the valuation, increases and decreases in valuation give rise to a similar change in the equity instrument that is recognised in the income statement.\n\nIn addition, equity instruments that are held outside the private equity fund are measured using the income approach. This in/uni00AD volves discounting cash flows on the basis of current business cases using the weighted average cost of capital to determine the fair value of the financial instrument. Changes in fair values determined in connection with adjustments to significant input factors are not material for the BMW Group.\n\nThe convertible bonds that have been classified to Level 3 are primarily used as instruments in advance of future financing rounds relating to private equity investments. Valuations are therefore performed in accordance with the IPEV guidelines.\n\nMandatory conversions are usually structured in such a way that the number of shares to be received depends on the future share price. Due to the generally short maturities, the instruments are subject to only insignificant fluctuations in value. Irrespective of this fact, impairment tests are performed at regular intervals.\n\nThe exercise price for share options in such companies is gen/uni00AD erally low, verging towards zero. Consequently, financing rounds have a direct impact on the fair value of the options. In this re/uni00AD spect, the valuation of options and assessment of their impact on sensitivity is similar to the approach taken to unquoted equity instruments, as described above.\n\nFor specific derivative instruments used to hedge raw materials price risks, a complete set of data relevant for valuation purpos/uni00AD es was not always available in the past due to their limited mar/uni00AD ket maturity. For this reason, data was obtained by means of regular bank and trader inquiries in order to model the forward curves required for valuation purposes. Changes in fair values resulting from these shifts in forward curves in a range of + / - 10 % were not material for the BMW Group.",

        "page_content": "Net gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income mainly relate to changes in the fair value of marketable securities. Further de/uni00AD tails are provided in the disclosures relating to the statement of comprehensive income ( /uni2197 note 20 ). Total interest income arising on financial assets measured at fair value through other compre/uni00AD hensive income amounted to \u20ac/uni00A037/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A031/uni00A0million) and total interest expense to \u20ac/uni00A010/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A018/uni00A0million).\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss mainly include results from the fair value measurement of stand/uni00ADalone derivatives, market/uni00AD able securities and shares in investment funds, as well as other financial assets.\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise mainly exchange rate gains / losses and impairment losses / reversals.\n\nNet gains and losses arising on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise mainly exchange rate gains / losses.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at amortised cost are subject to changes in fair value that are recognised through profit or loss due to designated hedging relationships. These changes in fair value are largely neutralised by the offsetting changes in fair value arising on hedging transactions and for this reason are not recognised in net gains and losses. Prior year figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nTotal interest income arising on financial assets measured at amortised cost relates mainly to the interest income earned on credit financing and reported within revenues. Total interest expenses arising on financial instruments measured at amor/uni00AD tised cost amounted to \u20ac/uni00A01.7/uni00A0billion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A01.6/uni00A0billion).\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to counterparty credit risks if con/uni00AD tractual partners, for example a retail customer or a dealership, are unable or only partially able to meet their contractual obligations. Information on the management of credit risk for receivables from financial services is provided in the Combined Management Report /uni2197 Risks and Opportunities .\n\nNotwithstanding the existence of collateral accepted, the carry/uni00AD ing amount of financial assets (with the exception of derivative financial instruments) generally represents the maximum credit risk. In addition, the credit risk is increased by additional unuti/uni00AD lised loan commitments in the dealership financing line of busi/uni00AD ness. Total dealership financing credit risk at the end of the reporting period therefore amounted to \u20ac/uni00A031,163/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A031,508/uni00A0million).\n\nIn the case of all relationships underlying non/uni00ADderivative financial instruments, in order to minimise the credit risk and depending on the nature and amount of exposure, collateral is required, credit information and references obtained or historical data based on the existing business relationship, in particular payment behaviour, reviewed.\n\nIn the case of trade receivables, customers are regularly assessed with regard to their credit risk. Depending on contractual status, necessary measures, such as dunning procedures, are initiated in good time.\n\nThe credit risk relating to cash deposits and derivative financial instruments is minimised by the fact that the Group only enters into such contracts with parties of first/uni00ADclass credit standing.\n\nWithin the financial services business, items financed for retail customers and dealerships (such as vehicles, facilities and\n\nproperty) serve as first/uni00ADranking collateral with a recoverable value. Security is also put up by customers in the form of collateral asset pledges, asset assignment and first/uni00ADranking mortgages, supple/uni00AD mented where appropriate by warranties and guarantees. Items previously held as collateral that are subsequently acquired relate mainly to vehicles. As a rule, these assets can be converted into cash at short notice through the dealership organisation. Creditworthiness testing is an important aspect of the BMW/uni00A0Group's credit risk management. Every borrower's creditworthiness is tested for all credit financing and lease contracts entered into by the BMW/uni00A0Group. In the case of retail customer financing, credit/uni00AD worthiness is assessed using validated scoring systems integrated in the purchasing process.\n\nIn the area of dealership financing, creditworthiness is assessed by means of ongoing credit monitoring and an internal rating system that takes account not only of the material credit standing of the borrower, but also of qualitative factors, such as past reliability in business relations.\n\nThe credit risk on trade receivables is assessed mainly on the basis of information relating to overdue amounts. The gross carrying amounts of these receivables are allocated in accordance with IFRS 9 to overdue ranges used for management purposes as follows:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million   | 31. 12. 2022                                                                          | 31. 12. 2021                              |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Not overdue                  | /three.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/one.tf /two.tf/period.tf/one.tf/one.tf/three.tf |                                           |\n| 1 - 30 days overdue          | /two.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                                                              | /one.tf/two.tf/zero.tf                    |\n| 31 - 60 days overdue         | /three.tf/one.tf                                                                      | /one.tf/two.tf                            |\n| 61 - 90 days overdue         | /one.tf/one.tf                                                                        | /one.tf/four.tf                           |\n| More than 90 days overdue    | /six.tf/five.tf                                                                       | /three.tf/four.tf                         |\n| Total                        | /four.tf/period.tf/one.tf/eight.tf/six.tf                                             | /two.tf/period.tf/two.tf/nine.tf/three.tf |",

The amounts disclosed for derivative instruments comprise only cash flows relating to de/uni00AD rivatives that have a negative fair value at the balance sheet date. In the case of derivatives with a negative fair value, an overall positive cash flow can arise due to the various yield curves used. At 31 December 2022, credit commitments available at short notice to dealerships which had not been called upon at the end\n\nof the reporting period amounted to \u20ac/uni00A016,044/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A018,334/uni00A0million).\n\nSolvency is assured at all times by managing and monitoring the liquidity situation on the basis of a rolling cash flow forecast.\n\nThe resulting funding requirements are covered by a variety of instruments placed on the world's financial markets, with the aim\n\nto minimise risk by matching maturities with financing require/uni00AD ments and in alignment with a dynamic target debt structure.\n\nAs a further reduction of risk, a syndicated credit line totalling \u20ac/uni00A08 billion (2021: \u20ac/uni00A08 billion) from a consortium of international banks is available to the BMW Group. Intragroup cash flow fluc/uni00AD tuations are balanced out by the use of daily cash pooling ar/uni00AD rangements. Further information is provided in the Combined Management Report.",

        "page_content": "## Market risks\n\nThe principal market risks to which the BMW Group is exposed are currency risk, interest rate risk and raw materials market price risk.\n\nProtection against such risks is provided in the first instance though natural hedging which arises when the values of non/uni00AD derivative financial instruments have matching maturities and amounts (netting). Derivative financial instruments are used to reduce the risk remaining after netting.\n\nCurrency, interest rate and raw materials market price risks of the BMW Group are managed at a corporate level.\n\nFurther information is provided in the /uni2197 Risks and Opportunities section of the Combined Management Report.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nAs an enterprise with worldwide operations, the BMW Group conducts business in a variety of currencies, from which currency risks arise. In order to hedge currency risks, the BMW Group holds, as at 31 December 2022, derivative financial instruments mostly in the form of forward currency contracts and currency swaps.\n\nAs part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular intervals. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they are denominated in the same currency and have the same maturities. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, ineffective/uni00AD ness is not expected to arise.\n\nThe BMW Group measures currency risk using a cash/uni00ADflow/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk model. The analysis of currency risk is based on forecast foreign currency transactions which could result in exposures to sur/uni00AD pluses of foreign currency cash inflows and cash outflows. At the end of the reporting period, the overall currency exposure - in each case for the following year and determined by aggregating the individual currency exposures based on their absolute amount - was as follows:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million   | 31. 12. 2022                                       | 31. 12. 2021                                        |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Currency exposure            | /four.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/nine.tf | /three.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/three.tf/four.tf |\n\nCurrency  exposures  include  short  positions  amounting  to \u20ac/uni00A0 3,604/uni00A0 million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A0 2,715/uni00A0 million). In addition to the exposures reported in 2021, a currency risk exposure existed on purchase price payable arising in connection with the increase in the BMW Group's stake in BMW Brilliance for a euro/uni00ADequivalent amount of \u20ac/uni00A03,857/uni00A0million. The transaction was completed in February 2022. Further information is provided in /uni2197/uni00A0 note/uni00A0 3 Increased shareholding in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.\n\nThe currency exposure is compared to all hedges that are in place. The net cash flow surplus represents an uncovered risk position. The cash/uni00ADflow/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk approach involves showing the impact of potential exchange rate fluctuations on operating cash flows on the basis of probability distributions. Volatilities and correlations serve as the main input factors to determine the relevant probability distributions.\n\nThe potential negative impact on earnings is calculated at the reporting date for each currency for the following financial year on the basis of current market prices and exposures with a con/uni00AD fidence level of 95 %.

        "page_content": "Interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives. As part of the implementation of the risk manage/uni00AD ment strategy, interest rate risks are monitored and managed at regular intervals. The interest rate contracts used for hedging purposes comprise mainly swaps, which, if hedge accounting is applied, are accounted for as fair value hedges. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instru/uni00AD ment is based on the fact that the main parameters of the hedged item and the related hedging instrument, for example start date, term and currency, are the same. Items are hedged on the basis of a constant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nIn view of the fact that own credit risk is excluded from the hedg/uni00AD ing relationship, ineffectiveness is expected to be low.\n\nFor selected fixed/uni00ADinterest assets, part of the interest rate risk is hedged on a portfolio basis. In this case, swaps are used as the hedging instrument. Hedge relationships are terminated and redesignated on a monthly basis at the end of each reporting period, thereby taking account of the constantly changing content of each portfolio.\n\nIn light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark in/uni00AD terest rates, some of the BMW Group's hedging relationships have been redesignated to take account of alternative benchmark interest rates.\n\nThe transition to the newly created or revised benchmark interest rates is being managed, monitored and assessed with regard to risk management implications as part of a multidisciplinary pro/uni00AD ject. The tasks of the conversion project includes the continual monitoring of regulatory developments, the initiation of neces/uni00AD sary changes to systems, processes, risk and measurement models as well as the clarification of the associated accounting and financial reporting implications.\n\nIn light of the reform and replacement of certain benchmark in/uni00AD terest rates, some of the BMW Group's fair/uni00ADvalue hedging rela/uni00AD tionships have been redesignated. The BMW Group's fair value hedges affected by the reform are mainly based on the bench/uni00AD mark interest rates relating to the British pound (GBP), the US dollar (USD) and the Japanese yen (JPY). All fair value hedges for which LIBOR was previously designated as the hedged risk were converted in the year to 31 December 2021, with GBP LIBOR replaced by the SONIA benchmark interest rate, JPY LIBOR by TONA and USD LIBOR by SOFR. The BMW Group continues to see the economic link and has therefore continued to account for the pertinent items as fair value hedges.\n\nIn the case of USD LIBOR and CAD CDOR, uncertainty remains as to the exact timing and nature of the changes. The nominal amount of non/uni00ADderivative financial liabilities not yet converted to an alternative interest rate at 31 December 2022 is \u20ac/uni00A0654/uni00A0million (thereof USD LIBOR \u20ac/uni00A0412/uni00A0million and CAD CDOR \u20ac/uni00A0242/uni00A0million). The notional amount of financial derivatives not yet converted to an alternative interest rate at 31 December 2021 is \u20ac/uni00A0100/uni00A0million (PLN WIBOR \u20ac/uni00A0100/uni00A0million).\n\nThe BMW Group applies a value/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk approach throughout the Group for internal reporting purposes and to manage interest rate risk.\n\nThis approach is based on a historical simulation in which the potential future fair value losses of the interest rate portfolios are compared across the Group with expected amounts on the basis of a holding period of 250 days and a confidence level of 99.98 %. The risk mitigating effect of correlations between the various portfolios is taken into account when the risks are aggre/uni00AD gated.\n\nIn the following table the potential volumes of fair value fluctua/uni00AD tions - measured on the basis of the value/uni00ADat/uni00ADrisk approach - are compared with the expected value for the interest/uni00ADrate/uni00ADsensitive exposures of the BMW Group:\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million   | 31. 12. 2022                              | 31. 12. 2021                              |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Value at risk                | /two.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/nine.tf/seven.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/three.tf/seven.tf |\n\n## Raw materials price risk\n\nThe BMW Group is exposed to market price risks on raw mate/uni00AD rials. In order to hedge these risks, the Group mainly uses forward commodity contracts. As part of the implementation of the risk management strategy, the extent to which risk exposures should be hedged is decided at regular intervals and the corresponding hedging ratio defined. Items are hedged on the basis of a con/uni00AD stant ratio of one to one between hedging instrument and risk exposure.\n\nCauses of hedge ineffectiveness are seen potentially only for counterparty credit risk. However, in view of the processes that have been established for credit risk management, ineffective/uni00AD ness is not expected to arise.\n\nThe economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is based essentially on the fact that they have the same basis and term. The BMW Group designates only the commodity price index/uni00ADlinked raw materials surcharge, which is specified in the purchase contracts of vehicle components, as a hedged item. The proportion of the hedged risk component as a percentage of the total fair value depends on the specific types of vehicle component involved. Other price components con/uni00AD tained in the contract are not designated as being part of the hedge relationship as no effective hedging instruments exist for these components.",

Furthermore, re/uni00AD ceivables from a non/uni00ADconsolidated Russian subsidiary were written down in full.\n\nBMW Trust administers assets on a trustee basis to secure obli/uni00AD gations relating to pensions in Germany and is therefore a related party of the BMW Group in accordance with IAS 24. This entity has no assets of its own. It had no income or expenses during the period under report. BMW AG bears expenses on an imma/uni00AD terial scale and performs services for BMW Trust.\n\nThe BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt, Munich, is an independent corporate foundation and, due to the BMW Group's significant influence, qualifies as a related party according to IAS 24. The BMW Group made donations to the BMW Foundation Herbert Quandt during the financial year 2022 totalling \u20ac/uni00A05.9/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A05.9/uni00A0million). No other significant transactions arose.\n\n## 43  Share/uni00ADbased remuneration\n\nThe BMW Group has three share/uni00ADbased programmes: one for eligible employees, one for eligible senior department heads and one for members of the Board of Management.\n\n## Employee Share Programme\n\nWithin the scope of the Employee Share Programme in the finan/uni00AD cial year 2022, eligible BMW Group employees were granted non/uni00AD voting shares of BMW AG preferred stock on preferential terms (see /uni2197 note 32 Equity for information on the number and price of the shares of preferred stock issued). At their discretion, participants in the programme were able to purchase packages of 10, 20, 35, 50 or 65 shares of preferred stock (2021: 10, 20, 30, 40 or 90) with a discount of \u20ac/uni00A016.00 (2021: \u20ac/uni00A013.50) on each share as compared to the market price (average closing price in Xetra trading in the period 1 to 4 November 2022: \u20ac/uni00A075.06). Employees who are currently employed by BMW AG or a wholly/uni00ADowned associate of BMW AG based in Germany were able to partake in the programme, insofar as the associate company's management had decided to participate. Employees were required to have been in their positions for at least one year without interruption at the time the programme was announced, and had to remain in their positions until the shares of preferred stock were trans/uni00AD ferred.\n\nThe shares of preferred stock acquired in the scope of the Employee Share Programme are subject to a vesting period of four years calculated from 1 January of the year in which the shares of preferred stock were acquired.\n\nA total of 1,439,975 shares of preferred stock were transferred to employees in the reporting year (2021: 1,718,070). Of these, 1,439,975  stemmed  from  Authorised  Capital  2019  (2021: 1,715,000). BMW AG's Board of Management decides each year whether to continue the programme.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the BMW Group recorded personnel expenses resulting from the Employee Share Programme relating to the difference between the market price and the discounted price for the shares of preferred stock purchased by employees totalling \u20ac/uni00A023/uni00A0million (2021: \u20ac/uni00A023/uni00A0million).\n\n## Senior department head and Board of Management programme\n\nBoth the share/uni00ADbased remuneration programme for members of the Board of Management that was in force in the reporting year and the share/uni00ADbased remuneration programme for eligible senior department heads serve to reward long/uni00ADterm entrepreneurial conduct with sustainable business management in mind.",

        "page_content": "Board of Management members and eligible senior department heads receive an earmarked cash amount (personal cash invest/uni00AD ment amount) that is, net of tax and deductions, to be invested in shares of BMW AG common stock. This amount depends on the achievement of certain financial and non/uni00ADfinancial targets in the past financial year (vesting year).\n\nPayment of the personal cash investment amount is made after the Annual General Meeting at which the Financial Statements are presented for the relevant financial year. The shares of com/uni00AD mon stock are purchased immediately after the personal cash investment amount has been paid out and are subject to a hold/uni00AD ing period of four years from the date of purchase. The RoCE component and the strategic focus target component each make up half of the target amount for the personal cash investment amount. For the RoCE component, a RoCE factor is determined based on the RoCE achieved in the Automotive segment for the grant year. For the strategic focus target component, a minimum of two strategic focus targets are defined prior to the start of the financial year. Minimum, target and maximum values are defined and factors are assigned for the RoCE in the Automotive segment and for each strategic focus target. The relevant factors are de/uni00AD termined after the end of the financial year based on the extent to which targets were achieved.\n\nFor financial years up to and including financial year 2020, Board of Management members received an earmarked cash amount (investment component) corresponding to 45 % of the gross amount of the bonus that, net of tax and deductions, had to be invested in shares of the Company's common stock (up to and including financial year 2017, the investment component amount/uni00AD ed to 20 % of the total bonus after tax, which the Board of Man/uni00AD agement members received plus tax and social security as ad/uni00AD ditional cash remuneration). This amount was also subject to a four/uni00ADyear holding period and on expiry thereof the Board of Man/uni00AD agement members received an additional share of the Compa/uni00AD ny's common stock or the equivalent value in cash (matching component) for every three shares of common stock held, at BMW AG's discretion.\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early payment of share/uni00ADbased remuneration components (matching components) based on the target amounts, and the holding period is also dropped for shares of common stock that were acquired with share/uni00ADbased remuneration components. Where the service contract is terminated prematurely and the Company has an extraordinary right of termination, or if the Board member resigns without the Company's agreement, entitlements to amounts as yet unpaid relating to share/uni00ADbased remuneration (matching components) are forfeited; a personal cash investment amount will be settled based on the target amount.\n\nUp to and including financial year 2021, eligible senior depart/uni00AD ment heads committed to invest 26 % of their earnings/uni00ADrelated bonus in shares of BMW AG common stock and to hold the acquired shares for four years. For the investment obligation, BMW AG granted an amount corresponding to the entire invest/uni00AD ment amount as a net subsidy.\n\nParticipants receive an additional share of common stock or the equivalent value in cash for every three shares of common stock held once the four/uni00ADyear holding requirement has been fulfilled, at the Company's discretion.\n\nThe Board of Management members in office on the balance sheet date hold 118,604 shares of BMW common stock with a holding obligation arising from share/uni00ADbased remuneration for financial years 2018 to 2021 (2021: 58,560).\n\nThe expenses and the corresponding allowance against the cash reserve for the personal cash investment amount of the eligible active Board of Management members and senior department heads amount to \u20ac/uni00A020,175,614 (2021: \u20ac/uni00A021,616,110).\n\nThe share/uni00ADbased remuneration component is revalued at its fair value at each balance sheet date between the grant date and\n\nthe settlement date and on the settlement date itself. The expense for such programmes is recognised in the income statement (as personnel expense) on a straight/uni00ADline basis over the vesting period of the options and in the balance sheet as a provision.\n\nThe remuneration system does not provide for any further match/uni00AD ing components for the members of the Board of Management from financial year 2021 or for the senior department heads from financial year 2022.\n\nThe cash settlement of the share/uni00ADbased remuneration component is measured at fair value on the balance sheet date (closing price of BMW AG common stock in Xetra trading on 31 December 2022).\n\nThe total carrying amount of the provision for the share/uni00ADbased remuneration component for eligible active and former Board of Management members and senior department heads was \u20ac/uni00A06,971,951 on 31 December 2022 (2021: \u20ac/uni00A08,347,245).\n\nThe total expense arising from the share/uni00ADbased remuneration component for eligible active and former Board of Management members and senior department heads was \u20ac/uni00A0638,715 in financial year 2022 (2021: \u20ac/uni00A02,743,398).\n\n## 44   Declaration concerning the German Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft have issued the prescribed Declaration of Compliance with the recommendations of the 'Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code' required by \u00a7 161 of the German Stock Corpo/uni00AD ration Act (AktG).

The segmentation follows the internal management and reporting system and takes account of the or/uni00AD ganisational structure of the BMW Group based on the various products and services of the reportable segments.\n\nThe activities of the BMW Group are broken down into the oper/uni00AD ating segments Automotive, Motorcycles, Financial Services and Other Entities.\n\nWithin the Automotive segment, the BMW Group develops, man/uni00AD ufactures, assembles and sells automobiles powered with all/uni00ADelectric drive systems, plug/uni00ADin hybrid systems and highly ef/uni00AD ficient combustion engines, as well as spare parts, accessories and mobility services under the BMW, MINI and Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brands. BMW and MINI brand products are sold in Germany through branches of BMW AG and by independent, authorised dealers. Sales outside Germany are handled mainly by subsidiary companies and by independent import companies in some mar/uni00AD kets. Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brand vehicles are sold in selected markets via subsidiary companies and elsewhere by independent, authorised dealers.\n\nActivities relating to the development, manufacture, assembly and sale of motorcycles as well as spare parts and accessories are reported in the Motorcycles segment.\n\nAutomobile and motorcycle leasing, retail and dealership financ/uni00AD ing, multi/uni00ADbrand fleet business, customer deposit business and insurance activities are the main activities allocated to the Finan/uni00AD cial Services segment.\n\nHolding and Group financing companies are reported in the Other Entities segment. This segment also includes the operating com/uni00AD panies BMW Services Ltd., BMW (UK) Investments Ltd. and Ba/uni00AD varia Lloyd Reiseb\u00fcro GmbH, which are not allocated to one of the other segments.\n\n## Internal management and reporting\n\nSegment information is prepared as a general rule in conformity with the accounting policies adopted for preparing and present/uni00AD ing the Group Financial Statements. Exceptions to this general principle include the treatment of inter/uni00ADsegment warranties, the earnings impact of which is allocated to the respective segments on the basis used internally to manage the business. In addition, intragroup repurchase agreements between the Automotive and Financial Services segments pursuant to IFRS 15, impairment allowances on intragroup receivables and changes in the value of consolidated other investments pursuant to IFRS 9 are also excluded. Intragroup leasing arrangements are not reflected in the internal management and reporting system on a IFRS 16 basis and therefore, in accordance with IFRS 8, do not give rise to any changes in the presentation of segment information. Inter/uni00AD segment receivables and payables, provisions, income, expens/uni00AD es and profits are eliminated upon consolidation. Inter/uni00ADsegment revenues are based on market prices. Centralised cost compo/uni00AD nents are included in the respective segments, without resulting in cash flows.\n\nThe role of 'chief operating decision maker' with respect to re/uni00AD source allocation and performance assessment of the reportable segment is embodied in the full Board of Management. For this purpose, different measures of segment performance as well as segment assets are taken into account in the operating seg/uni00AD ments.\n\nThe Automotive and Motorcycles segments are managed on the basis of return on capital employed (RoCE). The relevant meas/uni00AD ure of segment results used is therefore profit before financial result. Capital employed is the corresponding measure of seg/uni00AD ment assets used to determine how to allocate resources. With effect from the reporting year 2022, a simplified definition of capital employed is applied to make the RoCE calculation more comprehensible and transparent for users. Capital employed is calculated as the sum of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and net working capital, the latter comprising inven/uni00AD tories as well as trade receivables less trade payables.\n\nFurther information is provided in the section 'Managing oper/uni00AD ational performance at segment level' within the Combined Management Report.\n\nThe success of the Financial Services segment is measured on the basis of return on equity (RoE). Profit before tax therefore represents the relevant measure of segment earnings. The meas/uni00AD ure of segment assets in the Financial Services segment corre/uni00AD sponds to net assets, defined as total assets less total liabilities.\n\nThe success of the Other Entities segment is assessed on the basis of profit or loss before tax. The corresponding measure of segment assets used to manage the Other Entities segment is total assets less asset/uni00ADside income tax items and intragroup investments.",

Revenues with other segments result mainly from the sale of vehicles, for which the Financial Services segment has concluded a financing or lease contract. Eliminations of inter/uni00ADsegment items in the recon/uni00AD ciliation to the Group profit before tax, capital expenditure and depreciation and amortisation mainly result from the sale of vehicles in the Automotive segment, which are subsequently accounted for as leased vehicles in the Financial Services seg/uni00AD ment. In the reconciliation of segment assets to Group assets, eliminations relate mainly to intragroup financing balances.\n\nIn the information by region, external revenues are based on the location of the customer. The information disclosed for non/uni00ADcur/uni00AD rent assets relates to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and leased products. Eliminations disclosed for non/uni00ADcurrent assets relate to leased products.\n\n|                                                   | External revenues                                     | External revenues                                      | Non/uni00ADcurrent assets                          | Non/uni00ADcurrent assets                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Information by  region in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0million | 2022                                                  | 2021                                                   | 2022                                               | 2021                                                |\n| Germany                                           | /one.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/one.tf/three.tf      | /one.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/six.tf         | /four.tf/three.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/five.tf | /four.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/zero.tf/two.tf      |\n| China                                             | /four.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/eight.tf/one.tf     | /two.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/three.tf/three.tf    | /one.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf  | /three.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf                          |\n| USA                                               | /two.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/one.tf     | /two.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/two.tf/two.tf          | /one.tf/eight.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/one.tf/nine.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf |\n| Rest of Europe                                    | /three.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/two.tf     | /three.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/two.tf/zero.tf       | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/five.tf/zero.tf  | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/three.tf/four.tf    |\n| Rest of Asia                                      | /one.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/five.tf      | /one.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf/five.tf     | /two.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf/three.tf          | /two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/one.tf/five.tf            |\n| Rest of the Americas                              | /four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/four.tf/one.tf              | /three.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/one.tf              | /three.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/three.tf        | /three.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/two.tf/two.tf             |\n| Other regions                                     | /two.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf/seven.tf           | /two.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/six.tf/two.tf                 | /three.tf/three.tf/two.tf                          | /three.tf/two.tf/eight.tf                           |\n| Eliminations                                      | -                                                     | -                                                      | - /seven.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/four.tf/seven.tf      | - /seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/one.tf/seven.tf       |\n| Group                                             | /one.tf/four.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/one.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/one.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/three.tf/nine.tf | /nine.tf/six.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/two.tf/two.tf    | /eight.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/zero.tf |",

In addition, we have audited the group management report of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktien/uni00AD gesellschaft, which is combined with the Company's management report, for the financial year from 1 January to 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those parts of the group management report listed in the 'Other Information' section of our auditor's report.\n\nIn our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,\n\n- - the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to \u00a7/uni00A0[Article] 315e Abs.

We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accord/uni00AD ance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2) point (f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non/uni00ADaudit services prohibited under Article/uni00A05 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nKey Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judg/uni00AD ment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters.\n\nIn our view, the matters of most significance in our audit were as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## /one.tf Measurement of leased products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2     Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n\n- 3     Valuation of provisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees\n- 4     Accounting treatment of the acquisition of BMW/uni00A0 Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China\n\nOur presentation of these key audit matters has been structured in each case as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1     Matter and issue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2     Audit approach and findings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3     Reference to further information\n\nHereinafter we present the key audit matters:\n\n## /one.tf Measurement of leased products\n\n1     The BMW/uni00A0Group leases vehicles to end customers under operating leases (leased products). At the balance sheet date, the figure reported under the 'leased products' line item for operating leases was EUR/uni00A042,820/uni00A0million (approximately 17.3 % of total assets). Leased products are measured at cost, which is depreciated on a straight/uni00ADline basis over the lease term to the expected residual value (recoverable amount). A key estimated value for subsequent measurement of leased products is the expected residual value at the end of the lease term. For the residual value forecasts the BMW/uni00A0Group uses internally available data on historical empirical values, current market data and market estimates as well as forecasts by external market research institutes. The residual value esti/uni00AD mates also contain regulatory changes in the individual markets. The estimation of future residual values is subject to judgment due to the large number of assumptions to be made by the executive directors and the amount of data included in the determination.\n\nAgainst this background and due to the resulting significant uncertainties with regard to estimates in the context of meas/uni00AD uring the residual values of the leased products, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n2     As part of our audit we obtained an understanding of the development of operating leases, the underlying residual value risks as well as the business processes for the identi/uni00AD fication, management, monitoring and measurement of residual value risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents related to the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system, particularly regarding the determination of expected residual values. This included the evaluation of the propriety of the relevant IT systems as well as the implemented interfaces therein by our IT/uni00ADspecialists. In addition, we evaluated the appropriateness of the forecasting methods, the model assumptions as well as the parameters used for the measurement of the residual values based on the validations carried out by the BMW/uni00A0Group. For this purpose, we inquired with the BMW/uni00A0Group's experts responsible for the management and monitoring of residual value risks and inspected the internal analysis on residual value developments and residual value forecasts as well as the validation results. We examined the mathematical correct/uni00AD ness of the forecast values using the key calculation steps.\n\nBased on our audit procedures, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the methods and processes for determining the expected residual values of leased products underlying the valuation are appropriate and the assumptions and parameters included in the forecast model for the residual value are appropriate as a whole.\n\n3     The Company's disclosures on the applied 'Accounting poli/uni00AD cies, assumptions, judgments and estimations' are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 7 and on leased products are contained under note 24.",

        "page_content": "## 2     Valuation of receivables from sales financing\n\n1     The BMW/uni00A0Group offers end customers, dealerships and importers various financing models for vehicles. In this context, current and non/uni00ADcurrent receivables from sales financing totaling EUR/uni00A085,708/uni00A0million are reported in the consolidated statement of financial position as at the balance sheet date (approximately 34.7 % of total assets). Impairment losses amounting to EUR/uni00A02,145/uni00A0million were recognized on these receivables as at the balance sheet date. In order to determine the amount of the necessary valuation allowances to be recognized with respect to receivables from sales financing, the BMW/uni00A0Group, among others, evaluates the creditworthiness of the dealers, importers and end customers, as well as any loss ratios, and risk provisioning parameters are derived based on historical default probabilities and loss ratios.\n\nThe determination of the valuation allowances by the executive directors is subject to a significant degree of judgment due to several value/uni00ADinfluencing factors such as the estimation of creditworthiness, the determination of probabilities of default and loss ratios and was therefore of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n- 2     As part of our audit we obtained a comprehensive understand/uni00AD ing of the development of receivables from sales financing, the associated default/uni00ADrelated risks as well as the business processes for the identification, management, monitoring and measurement of default risks, among other things by inquiries and inspection of documents on the internal calculation methods. Furthermore, we evaluated the appropriateness and effectiveness of the internal control system regarding the determination of the impairment loss to be recognized. In this context, we also evaluated the relevant IT systems and inter/uni00AD nal processes. The evaluation included an assessment by our IT/uni00ADspecialists of the appropriateness of the systems concerned and associated interfaces to ensure the completeness of data as well as the audit of automated controls for data processing.\n\nAs part of our audit we assessed in particular the appropriate/uni00AD ness of the risk classification procedures as well as the risk provisioning parameters used. For this purpose, we  analyzed in particular the validations of parameters that are regularly conducted by the Company. To assess the default risk, we also used targeted sampling of individual cases to examine whether the attributes for assignment to the respective risk categories were suitably available and the impairment losses had been calculated using the parameters defined for these risk categories.\n\nIn our view, the assumptions and parameters used in the measurement of receivables from sales financing were appropriate  overall.\n\n3     The Company's disclosures on the applied 'Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations' are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial state/uni00AD ments under note 7 and on 'receivables from sales financing' are contained under note 26.\n\n## 3     Valuation of provisions for statutory and non/uni00AD statutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees\n\n1\n\nProvisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees are included in the  consolidated financial statements of BMW/uni00A0Group as a material amount in other provisions. The obligations amounted to EUR/uni00A08,251/uni00A0mil/uni00AD lion (approximately 3.3 % of total assets) as at 31 December 2022. The BMW/uni00A0Group is responsible for the legally required warranty and product guarantees in the respective sales market. In order to estimate the liabilities arising from statu/uni00AD tory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees for vehicles sold, information on the type and volume of damages arising and on remedial measures is recorded and analyzed at vehicle model level. The expected amount of obligations is extrapolated from costs of the past and recognized as a provision in the corresponding amount,\n\nif the criteria of IAS 37 have been met. For specific or antici/uni00AD pated individual circumstances, for example recalls for vehicles sold, additional provisions are recognized provided they have not already been taken into account.\n\nThe determination of provisions is associated with unavoid/uni00AD able estimation uncertainties and is subject to a high risk of change, depending on factors such as notification of detected defects as well as claims made by vehicle owners. Against this background, this matter was of particular significance during our audit.\n\n- 2     In order to assess the appropriateness of the valuation  method used for the determination of the provisions for  statutory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guaran/uni00AD tees including the assumptions and parameters, we primarily obtained an understanding of the process for determining the assumptions and parameters through discussions with the responsible employees of the BMW/uni00A0Group. We also evaluated the appropriateness as well as effectiveness of controls for determining the assumptions and parameters. With the involvement of our IT specialists, we checked the IT systems used regarding their compliance. We compared the expenses for claims and technical actions with actual costs incurred in order to draw conclusions on the forecast accuracy. Based on a targeted sample of vehicle models, the mathematical correctness of the valuation model used across the Group was examined. We examined and evaluated the assumptions used by the BMW/uni00A0Group concerning the extent to which the past values were representative of the expected susceptibility of damage, the expected value of damage per vehicle (com/uni00AD prising parts and labor input) as well as the expected asser/uni00AD tion of claims from statutory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranties.",

        "page_content": "In our view, the method for the valuation of provisions for statutory and non/uni00ADstatutory warranty obligations as well as product guarantees is overall appropriate. Taking into con/uni00AD sideration the information available, we believe that, overall, the measurement parameters and assumptions used by the executive directors are appropriate.\n\n3     The Company's disclosures on the applied 'Accounting policies, assumptions, judgments and estimations' are con/uni00AD tained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under note 7 and on 'Other provisions' are contained under note 35.\n\n## 4     Accounting treatment of the acquisition of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China\n\n1 The BMW/uni00A0Group held 50 % of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China. A purchase agreement to acquire a further 25 % of the shares of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China, was entered into on 11 October 2018. On 11 October 2018, a purchase agreement was concluded for the acquisition of a further 25 % of the shares in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. Shenyang, China. The acquisition was subject to the removal of the joint venture obligation for automotive production in China, which occurred in January 2022. The closing of the transaction was on 11 February 2022., at a purchase price of EUR/uni00A03.7/uni00A0billion. The previously held shares are measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, which resulted in an appreciation effect of EUR/uni00A07.7/uni00A0billion in the financial year 2022. In the context of identifying hidden reserves as part of the purchase price allocation, the identi/uni00AD fiable assets and assumed liabilities and contingent liabilities of the company acquired were recognized at their fair values. The transaction resulted in goodwill of EUR/uni00A01.2/uni00A0billion.\n\nDue to the estimation uncertainties involved in measuring the assets and liabilities as part of the purchase price allocation, and the overall material impact in amount of the acquisition on the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial per/uni00AD formance of the BMW/uni00A0Group, this matter was of particular significance in the context of our audit.\n\n- 2     As part of our audit of the acquisition of BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., Shenyang, China, we first evaluated the contractual agreements with the involvement of our specialists in international accounting, and verified the purchase price paid as consideration for the acquired business operations using the supporting documentation provided to us regarding payment made. We also assessed the underlying opening balance sheet figures. Furthermore, we assessed the balance sheet underlying the acquisition based on the fair values at the date of first/uni00ADtime consolidation, and examined in particular the determination of the appreciation effect regarding the shares held so far as well as the identification of hidden reserves as part of the purchase price allocation. Thereby we evaluated, among other things, the appropriateness of the models on which the valuations were based as well as the valuation parameters and assumptions used. In view of the special features involved in calculating the fair values in the context of the purchase price allocation, our valuation special/uni00AD ists assisted us in the process. Together, we examined in particular the appreciation effect as well as the identification of hidden reserves as part of the purchase price allocation, and used checklists to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements required under IFRS 3.\n\nOverall, we were able to satisfy ourselves that the accounting treatment of this acquisition has been appropriately carried out and that the estimates and assumptions made by the executive directors are overall comprehensible and sufficiently substantiated.\n\n3     The Company's disclosures relating to the acquisition are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial state/uni00AD ments under note 3 'Increase of share in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.'\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe executive directors are responsible for the other information.

In addition the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on\n\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nFurthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group man/uni00AD agement report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group's position and, in all material respects, is con/uni00AD sistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor's report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.\n\nWe exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group man/uni00AD agement report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detect/uni00AD ing a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collu/uni00AD sion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.\n- - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrange/uni00AD ments and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.\n- - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.",

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor's report to the related disclo/uni00AD sures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.\n- - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial perfor/uni00AD mance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to \u00a7/uni00A0315e Abs. 1 HGB.\n- - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities with/uni00AD in the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.\n- - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group's position it provides.\n\n- - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit  evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective infor/uni00AD mation and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective  information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence require/uni00AD ments, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independ/uni00AD ence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\nReport on the Assurance on the Electronic Rendering of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Prepared for Publication Purposes in Accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0317 Abs. 3a HGB\n\n## Assurance Opinion\n\nWe have performed assurance work in accordance with \u00a7/uni00A0317 Abs. 3a HGB to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the rendering of the consolidated financial statements and the group management  report  (hereinafter  the  'ESEF  documents') contained in the electronic file BMW\\_AG\\_KA+KLB\\_ESEF/uni00AD2022/uni00AD 12/uni00AD31.zip and prepared for publication purposes complies in all material respects with the requirements of \u00a7/uni00A0328 Abs. 1 HGB for the electronic reporting format ('ESEF format').

Review of the past financial year from a/uni00A0remuneration perspective\n\n## REMUNERATION REPORT\n\nThe Board of Management and the Supervisory Board have pre/uni00AD pared this Remuneration Report in accordance with the require/uni00AD ments of \u00a7 162 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The report shows and explains the remuneration granted and owed/uni00A0 to  the individual current and former members of the Board/uni00A0of Management and the Supervisory Board of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW AG) in the financial year/uni00A02022. 1, 2\n\nIn order to facilitate understanding, the basic features of the re/uni00AD muneration systems applicable to the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board, as applied in the 2022 financial year, are also set out below. In view of the fact that in/uni00AD dividual members of the Board of Management also received remuneration components from earlier remuneration systems during the 2022 financial year (specifically the remuneration sys/uni00AD tems for the 2017 and 2020 financial years), elements of these systems are also explained to the extent necessary for compre/uni00AD hension.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesell/uni00AD schaft, Frankfurt am Main, Munich branch, has audited the Remuneration Report beyond the requirements of \u00a7 162/uni00A0(3) Sentences/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0AktG. The Auditor's Report is attached to this report.\n\n## I.  REVIEW OF THE PAST FINANCIAL YEAR FROM A/uni00A0REMUNERATION PERSPECTIVE\n\n2022 was a very successful financial year for the BMW Group. The BMW brand remained the global leader in the premium seg/uni00AD ment with its strong product portfolio and sales of more than two million vehicles. The Company once again accelerated its scale/uni00AD up of electromobility and more than doubled sales of all/uni00ADelectric BMW and MINI vehicles. With its custom/uni00ADmade vehicles, the Rolls/uni00ADRoyce brand recorded record global sales, and 2022 was also the strongest sales year in BMW Motorrad's history.\n\nThe BMW Group generated a strong profit in the 2022 financial year. Group net profit amounted to \u20ac/uni00A018.6 billion (previous year: \u20ac 12.5 billion), with \u20ac/uni00A017.9 billion attributable to BMW/uni00A0AG share/uni00AD holders (previous year: \u20ac/uni00A012.4 billion), while the Group return on sales after tax amounted to 13.0 % (previous year: 11.2 %).",

        "page_content": "Despite the challenges with the semiconductor and energy sup/uni00AD ply, pandemic/uni00ADrelated lockdowns in China, the effects of the war in Ukraine and the tense geopolitical situation, the BMW Group was able to successfully continue its transformation towards electromobility and digitalisation under the leadership of the Board of Management. This is evident in the systematic further development of the NEUE KLASSE vehicle concept, which serves as the basis of a highly innovative future product portfolio, and in the focused digitalisation of sales towards an agency model in selected markets.\n\nThe Supervisory Board adopted the current remuneration system for the members of the Board of Management with effect from 1/uni00A0 January 2021. The Annual General Meeting approved it on 12/uni00A0May 2021 with a majority of 91.60 % of the valid votes cast. The Super visory Board did not resolve any changes to the remu/uni00AD neration system or the target remuneration in the remuneration levels set out for the members of the Board of Management in the 2022 financial year.\n\nIn December 2021, the Supervisory Board set ambitious targets linked to the variable remuneration of the members of the Board of Management for the 2022 financial year. Of the total variable target remuneration available, a total of 38 % is linked to envi/uni00AD ronmental, social or governance (ESG) targets. The Supervisory Board has set ambitious targets to reduce fleet carbon emissions in the EU and to increase electrified vehicle sales. These serve as strategic focus targets that correspond to 50 % of the long/uni00AD term variable remuneration (share/uni00ADbased remuneration). In doing so, the Supervisory Board has again underlined the strategic importance of the accelerated electrification of the vehicle fleet and placed particular emphasis on environmental sustainability targets, which make up 50 % of the long/uni00ADterm variable remuner/uni00AD ation.\n\nThanks to its strong overall performance, the Board of Manage/uni00AD ment exceeded both the financial and a large part of the non/uni00AD financial targets for short/uni00ADterm variable remuneration (bonuses) /uni2197 /uni00A0'Bonus for the 2022 financial year' . The financial target regarding long/uni00ADterm variable remuneration (share/uni00ADbased remuneration) was also exceeded. The Board of Management exceeded the/uni00A0 non/uni00ADfinancial strategic focus targets for the long/uni00ADterm variable remuneration in relation to the reduction of fleet carbon emissions in the/uni00A0EU, while the BMW/uni00A0Group's ambitious sales targets for electrified vehicles were not met in full /uni2197 Share/uni00ADbased remuneration for the financial year 2022 .\n\nIf necessary, and in the interest of the long/uni00ADterm success of BMW/uni00A0AG, the Supervisory Board may temporarily deviate from the remuneration system - as provided for in \u00a7 87a/uni00A0(2) Sen/uni00AD tence/uni00A02/uni00A0AktG. In accordance with G.11 of the German Corporate Governance Code dated 28 April 2022, the Supervisory Board has also reserved the right to make adjustments if extraordinary developments occur, such as significant acquisitions and dispos/uni00AD als, or changes in accounting standards or tax regulations that have a significant impact. After due examination, it did not make use of these options for the 2022 financial year. This applies in particular with regard to the one/uni00ADtime effect that the increased stake (from 50 % to 75 %) in BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. (BMW Brilliance) in the 2022 financial year had on the achieve/uni00AD ment of financial targets for the Board of Management's variable remuneration. This effect results from the revaluation of the pre/uni00AD viously held shares within the scope of the first/uni00ADtime consolida/uni00AD tion of BMW Brilliance in financial year 2022. As a result, in line with past practice in other cases of both positive and negative one/uni00ADtime effects, the Supervisory Board did not consider it nec/uni00AD essary to make changes to the Board of Management's remu/uni00AD neration. Rather, the cap established by the Supervisory Board for the performance/uni00ADrelated portion of the bonus - which also exists for the performance/uni00ADrelated remuneration of employees and senior executives - had the effect of limiting remuneration in accordance with its intended purpose.\n\nI.  Review of the past financial year from a/uni00A0remuneration perspective\n\nThe composition of the Board of Management did not change during the year. Dr. Post joined the Board of Management on 1/uni00A0January 2022, assuming responsibility for Purchasing and the Supplier Network. Dr. Wendt left the Board of Management on 31/uni00A0December 2021. Dr./uni00ADIng. Nedeljkovi\u0107 and Ms Horstmeier, who started their second period of office on 1/uni00A0October and 1 November 2022 respectively, are now eligible to receive thetarget remuner/uni00AD ation in the second/uni00A0remuneration level, which is available to mem/uni00AD bers of the Board of Management from their second period of office.\n\nThe remuneration system for the members of the Supervisory Board is set out in Article 15 of the Articles of Incorporation and provides only for fixed remuneration. It was confirmed by the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40 % of the valid votes cast, and implemented for the 2022 financial year in accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation.\n\nIn the 2022 financial year, there were several changes to the composition of the Supervisory Board among the employee rep/uni00AD resentatives, so that the Supervisory Board remuneration for individual Supervisory Board members had to be calculated pro/uni00AD portionately.\n\nTwo additional members, Ms Empey and Dr. Mohabeer, joined the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee on 1 October 2022. They were compensated proportionately from this point as mem/uni00AD bers of the Audit Committee in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation.\n\nThe composition of the Personnel Committee, which is respon/uni00AD sible for the preparation of remuneration decisions in accordance with the Supervisory Board's rules of procedure, did not change in the 2022 financial year. Mr Schoch left the Supervisory Board/uni00A0and therefore also the Personnel Committee and other committees on 31/uni00A0December 2022. Dr. Kimmich was initially",

In view of the high level of approval of the/uni00A02021 Remuneration Report, there was no reason to rethink the/uni00A0implementation of the current remuneration system or the manner of reporting in the 2022 financial year. In order to promote the transparency and clarity of reporting, additional information on remuneration for vesting year 2022 has been included in the/uni00A0section detailing compliance with maximum remuneration /uni2197/uni00A0 Maximum remuneration and remuneration vested in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## II.  REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE/uni00A0BOARD OF MANAGEMENT\n\n## 1. Principles of the remuneration system and the contribution of remuneration to the promotion of the Company's business strategy and its long/uni00ADterm development\n\nThe remuneration system in place since the 2021 financial year is easy to understand and clearly structured. It complies with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations and suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022. The Super/uni00AD visory Board has applied the following principles in designing the remuneration system for the Board of Management:\n\n- - The remuneration structure is geared towards the sustaina/uni00AD ble and long/uni00ADterm development of the Company. Therefore, variable remuneration components are predominantly grant/uni00AD ed on the basis of a multi/uni00ADyear assessment.\n- - The total remuneration of the members of the Board of Man/uni00AD agement is commensurate with their tasks and performance as well as the Company's situation.\n- - The remuneration system ensures that both positive and negative developments are appropriately reflected in the remuneration ('pay for performance').\n- - The remuneration system takes into account both the perfor/uni00AD mance of the entire Board of Management and the achieve/uni00AD ment of individual targets.\n- - The remuneration system observes the principle of consist/uni00AD ency in the Company's remuneration systems: remuneration systems for the Board of Management, executives and employees of BMW AG are all designed in a similar way.\n- - The total remuneration is in line with market practice both in terms of amount and structure, and takes into account the size, complexity and economic situation of the Company.\n\nThe BMW Group aims to be the most successful and sustainable premium provider of individual mobility. The business strategy focuses on the customer and the provision of sustainable indi/uni00AD vidual mobility in the premium segment, taking into account high profitability, in order to secure the Company's independence in the future. The remuneration system contributes to the imple/uni00AD mentation of the business strategy and the sustainable and long/uni00AD term development of the Company. It also takes into account the concerns of the Company's important stakeholders (in particular, shareholders, customers, and employees). The incentive effects of the various remuneration components have a complementary effect.\n\n- - The fixed basic remuneration counteracts the temptation to take disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short/uni00AD term goals, and thus contributes to the long/uni00ADterm develop/uni00AD ment of the Company.\n- - The variable bonus is divided into two parts which have dif/uni00AD ferent incentive effects. The earnings/uni00ADrelated component of the bonus rewards recipients for achieving the Company's financial targets in the vesting year, and promotes the earn/uni00AD ings/uni00ADrelated parts of the business strategy. In contrast, the performance component of the bonus is based on non/uni00ADfinan/uni00AD cial performance criteria, which are also derived from the business strategy. In this respect, the performance compo/uni00AD nent of the bonus also offers particular incentives to encour/uni00AD age individuals to pursue the goals of the business strategy consistently for the long/uni00ADterm development of the Company. These goals do not have to be directly reflected in the key financial indicators for a given vesting year.\n- - The amount of the variable share/uni00ADbased remuneration also depends on the fulfilment of financial and non/uni00ADfinancial ob/uni00AD jectives derived from the business strategy, since 50 % of the target cash amount earmarked for share purchases is linked to a financial key indicator (RoCE in the Automotive segment), and 50 % is linked to strategic focus targets. The obligation to use the total net amount to purchase shares of common stock in the Company and to hold these shares for at least four years also motivates the members of the Board of Man/uni00AD agement to strive to ensure the long/uni00ADterm positive develop/uni00AD ment of the Company, as this in turn promotes sustainable positive developments in the price of BMW shares.",

Determination and review of the remuneration system and individual remuneration\n\nDetermining the system and structure of Board of Management remuneration, and reviewing it regularly, is a task of the full Super/uni00AD visory Board, as is determining the individual level of remunera/uni00AD tion of members of the Board of Management. The Personnel Committee of the Supervisory Board assumes a preparatory function in the determination and review of the remuneration system as a whole, and of the individual remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board reviews the remuneration system annu/uni00AD ally to ensure it is appropriate in terms of structure, target and maximum remuneration, as well as actual remuneration. The Supervisory Board also takes remuneration studies into account when assessing the market conformity of the target and maxi/uni00AD mum remuneration, as well as when assessing actual remuner/uni00AD ation in horizontal terms. Due to the size and structure of the BMW Group, DAX companies are used as a comparison group and the remuneration data from this group is compared with the remuneration paid to members of the Board of Management at BMW/uni00A0AG. Vertically, the Supervisory Board compares the remu/uni00AD neration of members of the Board of Management with the re/uni00AD muneration of senior executives and with the average remuner/uni00AD ation of employees employed by BMW/uni00A0AG in Germany in areas inside and outside the scope of collective bargaining agreements, including in terms of how they have changed over a period of several years. Recommendations from independent external remuneration experts, as well as suggestions from investor and analyst circles, may also be included in the deliberations. For the/uni00A02022 financial year, the review has shown that the target, maximum and actual remuneration are appropriate.\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration system, the Supervisory Board - acting on the proposal of the Personnel Committee sets specific target remuneration for each individual member of the Board of Management for the upcoming financial year, as well as the performance criteria associated with the variable re/uni00AD muneration components provided for in the remuneration system.\n\nThe total target remuneration is composed of the fixed remuner/uni00AD ation and the variable remuneration. Within the variable target remuneration, the proportion of share/uni00ADbased remuneration as long/uni00ADterm variable remuneration exceeds the share of the bonus as short/uni00ADterm variable remuneration. The share of the individual remuneration components is within the ranges specified by the remuneration system.\n\n## Overview of total target remuneration for members of the Board of Management/one.numr\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Target remuneration for the 2022 financial year\n\nThe following tables show the individual target remuneration of the members of the Board of Management and the relative share of the respective remuneration component in the total target re/uni00AD muneration. The maximum remuneration and remuneration earned for the 2022 financial year are shown below /uni2197 II. 11. .",

Remuneration for the 2022 financial year\n\nFollowing a proposal by the Personnel Committee, the Supervi/uni00AD sory Board determined in December 2021 the target remunera/uni00AD tion for the members of the Board of Management for the 2022 financial year, as well as the performance criteria for the variable remuneration components provided for in the remuneration sys/uni00AD tem. In March 2023, at the suggestion of the Personnel Commit/uni00AD tee, the Supervisory Board set or confirmed the amount of the variable remuneration components due to the members of the Board of Management for the 2022 financial year after reviewing and assessing the extent to which the targets had been achieved.\n\n## a) Fixed remuneration for the 2022 financial year\n\nEach member of the Board of Management receives a fixed base salary, which is paid monthly on a pro rata basis. The fixed base salary ensures a minimum income appropriate to the tasks and responsibilities of a member of the Board of Management. It counteracts the temptation to take disproportionately high risks in order to achieve short/uni00ADterm goals, and thus contributes to the Company's long/uni00ADterm development.\n\nThe amount of the base salary depends on the individual's re/uni00AD spective function on the Board of Management and the duration of their tenure on the Board of Management or their appointment period/remuneration level, as applicable.\n\nThe fringe benefits include, in particular, non/uni00ADcash benefits from vehicle use and employee discounts and subsidies for safety equipment. In addition, the Supervisory Board can approve pay/uni00AD ments to newly appointed members of the Board of Management in order to compensate them for loss of salary from a previous employment relationship and/or to cover relocation costs. No such approvals were issued and no special allowances were made in the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Overview of fixed remuneration for financial year 2022\n\n| in/uni00A0\u20ac                 | Base salary                                                               | Fringe benefits (other                                 | remuneration) Total fixed remuneration                                     |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oliver Zipse                | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/nine.tf       | /one.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/six.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/four.tf/nine.tf   |\n| Ilka Horstmeier /uni200A1   | /nine.tf/two.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                  | /three.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf   | /nine.tf/six.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/eight.tf                 |\n| Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107 /uni200A2 | /nine.tf/three.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf               | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/four.tf       | /nine.tf/five.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/two.tf/four.tf                 |\n| Pieter Nota                 | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/seven.tf/three.tf      | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/six.tf/nine.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/seven.tf/three.tf  |\n| Nicolas Peter               | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /three.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/five.tf     | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/two.tf/five.tf |\n| Joachim Post                | /nine.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                 | /one.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/five.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/two.tf/five.tf/nine.tf    |\n| Frank Weber                 | /nine.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                 | /three.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf   | /nine.tf/three.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf               |\n\n- 1 Second remuneration level since 1 November 2022.\n- 2 Second remuneration level since 1 October 2022.\n\n## b) Variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year\n\nThe variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year consists of the bonus and the share/uni00ADbased remuneration. The bonus con/uni00AD sists of the earnings and performance components, and the share/uni00ADbased remuneration (personal cash investment amount) consists of the RoCE component and the strategic focus targets component. The performance criteria for the variable remunera/uni00AD tion paid to members of the Board of Management are based on the Group's key strategic financial and non/uni00ADfinancial targets and performance indicators, and sustainably promote the Group's development. When determining specific target values, the Supervisory Board takes into account, in particular, long/uni00ADterm corporate planning and business development planning for the following year as submitted to the Supervisory Board for approv/uni00AD al.

If 100 % of the target is achieved, the share of the bonus attached to each component is 50 % of the individ/uni00AD ual target amount of the bonus. The bonus amount is capped at 180 % of the individual target amount. The bonus is paid follow/uni00AD ing the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial statements for the vesting year are presented.\n\n## Earnings component of the bonus\n\nThe earnings component of the bonus rewards the performance of the business in the vesting year, as measured by the financial indicators 'Profit attributable to shareholders of BMW/uni00A0AG' and 'Group post/uni00ADtax return on sales'. For this purpose, the Super/uni00AD visory Board adopts an allocation matrix before the start of the vesting year, from which an earnings factor is derived based on the values achieved.\n\nFor both indicators, the Supervisory Board defines a minimum value, a target value and a maximum value before the start of the vesting year. If one of the minimum values is not reached, the earnings factor is zero (corresponding to a target achievement of 0 %). If both target values are reached, the earnings factor is 1.000 (corresponding to a target achievement of 100 %). If both maximum values are exceeded, the earnings factor is 1.800 (cor/uni00AD responding to a target achievement of 180 %, the highest pos/uni00AD sible percentage).

        "page_content": "## Targets set and extent of achievement - earnings component of the bonus for the 2022 financial year\n\nThe targets set and the extent to which they have been achieved, as well as the specific amounts associated with the earnings component of the bonus for the 2022 financial year, are shown in the following tables. In the 2022 financial year, BMW/uni00A0AG's share of profit attributable to shareholders was \u20ac/uni00A017.9/uni00A0billion, and the Group post/uni00ADtax return on sales was 13.0 %. Both key indica/uni00AD tors exceeded the maximum values defined for the assessment of the earnings component, so the earnings factor has been capped at the maximum value of 1.800. This corresponds to a target achievement of 180 %, the highest possible percentage.\n\n## Performance component of the bonus\n\nThe performance component of the bonus rewards the achieve/uni00AD ment of certain non/uni00ADfinancial targets. Before the beginning of the financial year, the Supervisory Board sets these targets in the form of various non/uni00ADfinancial performance criteria and associat/uni00AD ed metrics. The performance criteria are derived primarily from the corporate strategy, long/uni00ADterm corporate planning and the business development planning done for the following year. The targets are divided into individual targets for the individual mem/uni00AD bers of the Board of Management (departmental targets) and collective targets for the entire Board of Management (interde/uni00AD partmental targets). The Supervisory Board has discretion in weighting the performance criteria. Approximately 10 % of the target amount for the performance bonus is intended to be allo/uni00AD cated to the departmental targets. Departmental targets can be department/uni00ADspecific targets or contributions to shared targets measured individually for each department. The remainder of the target amount for the performance bonus (amounting to approx/uni00AD imately 90 %) should be associated with interdepartmental, non/uni00ADfinancial targets. In this regard, around 50 % of the target amount should be connected to the achievement of non/uni00ADfinancial targets relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG targets).\n\n## Targets set and extent of achievement - earnings component of the bonus for the 2022 financial year\n\n| Performance criteria                                                             | Minimum value               | Target value                | Maximum value                    | Actual value                       | Extent to which  target achieved  in/uni00A0%   | Earnings   factor                          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Profit attributable to shareholders of BMW/uni00A0AG  in/uni00A0\u20ac/uni00A0billion | /three.tf/period.tf/zero.tf | /five.tf/period.tf/three.tf | /one.tf/one.tf/period.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/nine.tf | /one.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf %                      | /one.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |\n| Group return on sales after tax in/uni00A0%                                      | /three.tf/period.tf/zero.tf | /five.tf/period.tf/six.tf   | /nine.tf/period.tf/zero.tf       | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf %                      | /one.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |\n\n## Overview of earnings component of the bonus for financial year 2022\n\n| Member of the Board of Management   | Proportionate target bonus   amount in/uni00A0\u20ac                           | Earnings factor                            | Earnings component   of the bonus in/uni00A0\u20ac                              |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Oliver Zipse                        | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |                                            | /one.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/nine.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |\n| Ilka Horstmeier /uni200A1           | /four.tf/nine.tf/one.tf/comma.tf/six.tf/six.tf/seven.tf                   |                                            | /eight.tf/eight.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                |\n| Milan Nedeljkovi\u0107 /uni200A2         | /five.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                 |                                            | /nine.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                  |\n| Pieter Nota                         | /five.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                | /one.tf/period.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |\n| Nicolas Peter                       | /five.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                |                                            | /one.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/three.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |\n| Joachim Post                        | /four.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                |                                            | /eight.tf/five.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                 |\n| Frank Weber                         | /four.tf/seven.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                |                                            | /eight.tf/five.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf                 |\n\n- 1 Second remuneration level since 1 November 2022.\n- 2 Second remuneration level since 1 October 2022.",

The performance factor for the bonus was determined from the partial performance factors, with a weighting of 10 % for the departmental targets and 90 % for the interdepartmental targets, in each case in re/uni00AD lation to the target amount of the performance component of the bonus. With regard to the interdepartmental targets, 50 % of the weighting is for non/uni00ADfinancial environmental, social and govern/uni00AD ance (ESG) targets, and 40 % is for other non/uni00ADfinancial targets, in each case in relation to the target amount of the performance component of the bonus.\n\nIn order to determine the extent to which targets were achieved, the Supervisory Board assessed the leadership performance of the individual members of the Board of Management and the overall performance of the Board of Management as a whole. With regard to the departmental targets, the Supervisory Board assessed the individual performance of each member of the Board of Management. With regard to the interdepartmental tar/uni00AD gets, the Supervisory Board considered the Board of Manage/uni00AD ment as a team and assessed the performance of all the mem/uni00AD bers of the Board of Management as a whole. The Supervisory Board's decision/uni00ADmaking process is based on a detailed, docu/uni00AD mented analysis of performance as measured against all the agreed criteria, as well as in/uni00ADdepth discussions at Personnel Committee and full Supervisory Board level. As a basis for its assessment, the Supervisory Board was guided, in particular, by\n\nthe quantitative and qualitative metrics defined in the corporate planning that had been carried out before the beginning of the financial year. These metrics include, for example, key indicators such as vehicle sales, segment shares and the share of sales for electrified vehicles, as well as other metrics for assessing sus/uni00AD tainability performance, R&D rate, the quality of the customer experience compared to the competition, investments in training and further education and targets for diversity in the workforce. The results of comparative studies and calculations vis/uni00AD\u00e0/uni00ADvis competitors were also used to assess individual metrics. In ad/uni00AD dition to a review of performance in 2022, the Supervisory Board carried out a trend review covering several financial years. In doing so, it assessed the effects of decisions, measures and the overall course set in previous financial years on the 2022 financial year and also estimated the significance of the performance in 2022 for the future development of the Company.\n\n## Overview of targets for the performance component of the bonus for financial year 2022\u00b9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Based on the target amount of the performance component of the bonus.\n\n- 3 Collective assessment of the Board of Management as a team.\n\nII.

This amount depends on the achievement of certain financial and non/uni00ADfinancial targets in the past financial year (vest/uni00AD ing year). The members of the Board of Management are obliged to invest their personal cash investment amounts (less taxes and duties) in BMW/uni00A0 shares of common stock immediately after dis/uni00AD bursement, and to hold these shares for a period of at least four years (share ownership guideline). The obligation to purchase\n\nBMW shares of common stock and the multi/uni00ADyear holding period strengthens the entrepreneurial long/uni00ADterm orientation of the Board of Management. Implementing the corporate strategy sustainably by taking appropriate decisions also creates lasting value for the shareholders, and thus regularly provides the basis for positive long/uni00ADterm capital market performance. Due to the substantial investment and the fixed holding period associated with these shares, members of the Board of Management par/uni00AD ticipate in the long/uni00ADterm positive (and negative) development of the Company, as reflected in the share price, even after their departure.\n\n## Personal cash investment amount\n\nThe personal cash investment amount is paid out after the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial statements for the vesting year are presented. The size of this amount de/uni00AD pends on the target amount, the RoCE achieved in the Auto/uni00AD motive segment and the degree to which certain strategic focus targets were achieved in the vesting year. The personal cash investment amount is limited to a maximum of 180 % of the tar/uni00AD get amount and is calculated as follows:\n\nPersonal cash investment amount =\n\nRoCE component + strategic focus target component",

In the second step, the values determined for the individual strategic focus targets using this calculation are added together. If two strategic focus targets are set, each strategic focus target accounts for 25 % of the individual target amount.

This simplified definition aims to make this indicator more transparent and easier to understand. In addition, the capital employed items taken into account reflect the focus of operational segment management.

Retirement benefits\n\nThe retirement benefits system provides for the Company to make annual contributions to a savings account for every year that members of the Board of Management are appointed. After they are confirmed, pension entitlements become vested when the employment relationship has existed for one year. Members of the Board of Management receive a disability pension in the event of invalidity and the termination of the employment rela/uni00AD tionship. Retired members of the Board of Management are en/uni00AD titled to retirement benefits after the age of 62 at the earliest and after leaving the Board. In the event of the death of a member of the Board of Management entitled to benefits before the occur/uni00AD rence of the insured event, a surviving spouse or registered part/uni00AD ner is entitled to a survivor's benefit; otherwise, surviving children are entitled to a survivor's benefit depending on their age and level of education. The amount of the benefits to be paid is de/uni00AD termined on the basis of the amount accrued in each Board member's individual pension savings account. This figure is in turn based on the annual contributions and annual profit partic/uni00AD ipation depending on the form of investment. For the contribu/uni00AD tions made, there is a guaranteed minimum interest rate equal to the maximum interest rate specified in the German actuarial reserve regulation (Deckungsr\u00fcckstellungsverordnung). The pay/uni00AD ment is made as a lump sum or in annual instalments at the discretion of the member of the Board of Management. For en/uni00AD titlements arising before 2016, there is an option to receive pay/uni00AD ment as a lifelong monthly pension or in a combined form. In the event of death or invalidity, a minimum benefit in the amount of the potential annual pension contributions that could have been made up to the age of/uni00A060 is approved. This benefit cannot exceed ten years of contributions.\n\nMembers of the Board of Management who retire immediately after their service on the Board, or who are deemed to be in an equivalent position, are entitled to acquire vehicles and other BMW Group products and services at conditions that also apply",

Malus and clawback provisions\n\nThe current remuneration system provides for the possibility of withholding variable remuneration (malus) and reclaiming vari/uni00AD able remuneration already paid out (clawback) under certain conditions. The rules allow the Supervisory Board to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration in the event of certain serious com/uni00AD pliance/uni00ADrelated violations (compliance malus and/or compliance clawback). These provisions can also be applied where variable remuneration components linked to the achievement of certain targets have been paid out on the basis of incorrect calculation bases or incorrect financial statements. Remuneration can also be withheld or reclaimed after an individual's departure from the Board of Management.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has not identified any reason to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration components in the 2022 finan/uni00AD cial year.\n\n## 8. Premature termination of activities and post/uni00AD contractual non/uni00ADcompetition clause\n\nBoard of Management service contracts provide for severance pay to be paid to the Board member in the event of premature termination by the Company without due cause, the amount of which is limited to a maximum of two years' remuneration (sev/uni00AD erance payment cap). The member will not be compensated for more than the remaining term of the service contract. If the re/uni00AD maining term of the contract is less than two years, the severance payment is reduced proportionately. The annual remuneration paid generally includes the base salary, the target amount of the bonus and target amount of the personal cash investment amount, unless the relevant target amount was not achieved in the previous year. In this case, the bonus that was actually grant/uni00AD ed or the personal cash investment amount that was actually disbursed will apply.\n\nThere are no specific severance arrangements covering early termination of a Board member's mandate due to a change of control or in connection with a takeover offer.\n\nIn the event of death or invalidity, special rules apply for early payment  of  performance  cash  plans  based  on  the  target amounts, and the holding period is also dropped for shares of common stock that were acquired with share/uni00ADbased remunera/uni00AD tion components. Where the service contract is terminated pre/uni00AD maturely and the Company has an extraordinary right of termi/uni00AD nation, or if the Board member resigns without the Company's agreement, entitlements to amounts as yet unpaid relating to performance cash plans and share/uni00ADbased remuneration (match/uni00AD ing components) are forfeited. The other variable remuneration components (bonus, personal cash investment amount) are set/uni00AD tled on the basis of the target amounts.\n\nA one/uni00ADyear post/uni00ADcontractual non/uni00ADcompetition clause has been agreed with the Board members under specified circumstances against payment of a remuneration amount. Service contracts provide for the payment of a monthly waiting allowance in the amount of the applicable monthly base salary for the duration of the post/uni00ADcontractual non/uni00ADcompetition clause. In accordance with Recommendation G.13 of the German Corporate Governance Code dated 28 April 2022, any severance payment is offset against the non/uni00ADcompetition clause remuneration amount. The same applies to other income from third parties, except remu/uni00AD neration for supervisory board appointments approved during the term of office. The Company may unilaterally waive the re/uni00AD quirement to comply with the post/uni00ADcontractual non/uni00ADcompetition clause.\n\nDr. Wendt left the Board of Management on 31/uni00A0December 2021. In accordance with the provisions of his service contract, a one/uni00AD year post/uni00ADcontractual non/uni00ADcompetition clause applied. For the period from 1 January 2022 to 31/uni00A0December 2022, the waiting allowance contractually owed to him amounts to \u20ac/uni00A01.1 million.",

Remuneration granted and owed to members of the Board of Management pursuant to \u00a7 162/uni00A0of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nThe following tables /uni2197/uni00A0 Remuneration granted and owed show the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of Management in the reporting year in accordance with \u00a7 162/uni00A0AktG.\n\nThe tables include all amounts received by the individual mem/uni00AD bers of the Board of Management in the reporting period (' remuneration granted') and all remuneration legally due but not yet received ('remuneration owed').\n\nIn addition to actual amounts received, 'remuneration granted' in the reporting year is also assumed if the activity on which the remuneration component is based has been fully performed by the member of the Board of Management as of the balance sheet date, and if all conditions for the accrual of entitlement (e.g. the expiry of assessment periods or the non/uni00ADoccurrence of forfeiture conditions) have occurred.\n\nThus, in addition to the fixed remuneration components, the fol/uni00AD lowing variable remuneration components are reported as remu/uni00AD neration granted for the 2022 financial year within the meaning of \u00a7 162/uni00A0of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG):\n\n- - Bonus for the 2022 financial year (to be paid out in 2023)\n- - Share/uni00ADbased  remuneration  (personal  cash  investment amount) for the 2022 financial year (to be paid out in 2023)\n- - Performance Cash Plan 2020-2022, due to the expiry of the three/uni00ADyear assessment period in the 2022 financial year (pay/uni00AD ments for vesting year 2020 to be paid out in 2023)\n- - Share/uni00ADbased remuneration component (matching compo/uni00AD nent) for vesting year 2017, due to the expiry of the four/uni00ADyear holding period in the 2022 financial year (paid out in 2022)\n\n## Overview of remuneration granted and owed in 2022 financial year with payout profile 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2 Payment of 2017 cash remuneration component (investment component) in 2018, immediately following the acquisition of shares of BMW common stock subject to holding requirements for 2018 - 2022.\n\nThus, the remuneration granted and owed includes all remuner/uni00AD ation components earned through the activities of the members of the Board of Management in the 2022 financial year. In addi/uni00AD tion, it includes remuneration components already earned as a result of activity in previous financial years, but for which the respective member of the Board of Management's payment entitlement only arose due to the occurrence of conditions or at the end of the 2022 financial year.\n\nIn addition to the absolute amount of remuneration, the relative share of the relevant remuneration component in the total remu/uni00AD neration granted and owed is also shown. For the sake of com/uni00AD pleteness, the individual service cost in accordance with IAS/uni00A019 for the company pension scheme is also shown, although this service cost is not classified as granted or owed remuneration within the meaning of \u00a7/uni00A0162 AktG.\n\n## a) Variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year\n\nThe variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year and the extent to which targets were achieved are set out above in /uni2197/uni00A0 Variable remuneration for the 2022 financial year .\n\n## b) Performance Cash Plan 2020-2022\n\nThe  remuneration  system  applicable  for  financial  years 2018 - 2020 provided for the Performance Cash Plan (PCP) as a long/uni00ADterm variable cash remuneration component.\n\nFor the purposes of calculating the Performance Cash Plan, a fixed target amount is multiplied by a multi/uni00ADyear target achieve/uni00AD ment factor (PCP factor) after the end of a three/uni00ADyear assessment period. The target amount of the Performance Cash Plan (100 %) for members of the Board of Management is \u20ac/uni00A00.85 million p.a. in the first period of office and \u20ac/uni00A00.95 million p.a. from the second",

The maximum payment amount is limited to 180 % of the target amount for the Performance Cash Plan p.a. for all members of the Board of Management.\n\nPCP entitlements are paid in cash. The bonus is paid out after the end of the Annual General Meeting at which the annual financial statements for the third year of the assessment period (consisting of the vesting year and the following two years) are presented.\n\nIn order to determine the PCP factor, a multi/uni00ADyear profit factor is multiplied by a multi/uni00ADyear performance factor. The PCP factor is limited to a maximum of 1.8.\n\nIn order to determine the multi/uni00ADyear earnings factor, an earnings factor is calculated for each year of the three/uni00ADyear assessment period and an average is then calculated for the assessment period. The earnings factor for the individual year of the assess/uni00AD ment period is determined on the basis of the Group's net prof/uni00AD it and the Group return on sales after tax for the assessment year concerned, and can amount to a maximum of 1.800. The under/uni00AD lying measurement values are determined in advance for a  period of three financial years, and may not be changed retrospectively.\n\nIn addition to the multi/uni00ADyear earnings factor, the Supervisory Board also sets a multi/uni00ADyear performance factor after the end of the assessment period. To this end, the Supervisory Board takes account in particular of the development of the business during the assessment period, the forecast trend in the development of the business, the Board member's individual contribution to prof/uni00AD itability and the status of compliance within the Board member's area of responsibility. The multi/uni00ADyear performance factor can be between 0.9 and 1.1.\n\nThe Performance Cash Plan 2020-2022 was approved for the performance of the members of the Board of Management in the 2020 financial year. As at the balance sheet date of the reporting year, the three/uni00ADyear assessment period of this remuneration com/uni00AD ponent, which was subject to certain forfeiture provisions, had expired. In the 2022 financial year, Group net profit of \u20ac 18.6 billion and a Group return on sales after tax of 13.0 % were achieved. For both indicators, the defined maximum values of \u20ac/uni00A0 11.0/uni00A0 billion for the Group net profit and 9.0 % for the Group return on sales after tax were thus exceeded, meaning that the earnings factor was capped at the maximum value of 1.800 (cor/uni00AD responding to a target being 180 % achieved, the maximum pos/uni00AD sible percentage). Based on the earnings factors for the individ/uni00AD ual years of the assessment period (financial year 2020: 0.444, financial year 2021: 1.800, 2022 financial year: 1.800), the multi/uni00AD year performance factor is 1.348.\n\nIn determining the multi/uni00ADyear performance factor for the members of the Board of Management in office for the financial year 2020, the Supervisory Board assessed, in particular, the trend in the development of the business over the assessment period, the forecast trend in the development of the business, the individual contribution made by each Board member to earnings, and the status of compliance in the individual Board member's area of responsibility. In assessing the development of the business over the assessment period and the forecast trend, the Supervisory Board looked in particular at the development of certain key in/uni00AD dicators - such as the change in the number of deliveries, EBIT margin for the Automotive segment and RoCE for the Automotive segment, as well as the return on equity for the Financial Servic/uni00AD es segment. The Supervisory Board took account of the effects of the Covid/uni00AD19 pandemic and the semiconductor crisis for finan/uni00AD cial years 2020 and 2021 and the effects of the war in Ukraine for financial year 2022. The multi/uni00ADyear performance factor for all entitled members of the Board of Management was 1.0, resulting in a PCP factor of 1.348 for Performance Cash Plan 2020/uni200A- 2022.\n\n## PERFORMANCE CASH PLAN OVERVIEW\n\n| TARGET AMOUNT   | PCP FACTOR   | AMOUNT PAID OUT /uni00A0                                |\n|-----------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 |              | -  Cash payment at the end of the assessment  period    |\n|                 |              | - Capped at /one.tf/eight.tf/zero.tf % of target amount |\n\n## Overview of the PCP factor\n\n| MULTI/hyphen.caseYEAR EARNINGS FACTOR   | MULTI/hyphen.caseYEAR PERFORMANCE FACTOR  = PCP FACTOR /uni00A0         |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| - Average earnings factor               | Measurement based on multi/uni00ADyear                                  |\n| -  Based on Group net profit and        | performance  factor:                                                    |\n| Group post/uni00ADtax return on sales   | - Trend in business development                                         |\n| -  Value between 0 and 1.800            | -  Status of compliance in each Board  member's area of responsibility  |\n|                                         | - Individual contribution to profitability                              |\n|                                         | -  Forecast trend in business development                               |\n|                                         | - Value between /zero.tf/period.tf/nine.tf and /one.tf/period.tf/one.tf |",

Remuneration of the members of the/uni00A0Board of Management\n\n## c) Share/uni00ADbased remuneration component (matching compo/uni00AD nent) 2017\n\nShare/uni00ADbased remuneration components have been included in the remuneration of members of the BMW/uni00A0AG Board of Manage/uni00AD ment since 2011. In the 2022 financial year, the matching com/uni00AD ponent of the share/uni00ADbased remuneration for vesting year 2017 was paid out. Under the share/uni00ADbased remuneration programme for financial year 2017, the members of the Board of Management in office in 2017 were each required to invest an amount equal to 20 % of the total bonuses they received as additional cash re/uni00AD muneration for financial year 2017, which were paid exclusive of taxes and social security contributions (the investment compo/uni00AD nent), in shares of the Company's common stock. In principle, the members of the Board of Management must hold these shares of common stock for at least four years. Under a matching plan, the member of the Board of Management receives from the Company - at the Company's discretion - either an additional share of common stock or the equivalent in cash (share/uni00ADbased remuneration component/matching component) for every three shares of common stock held after the four/uni00ADyear holding period. The investment component for financial year 2017 was paid out immediately after the 2018 Annual General Meeting on 17 May 2018, and the shares of common stock were acquired on 18 May 2018. Therefore, the holding period for the acquired shares of common stock expired on 17 May 2022. The Company settled the matching component in cash, and paid out the equivalent value of the matching shares.\n\n## d) Presentation of remuneration granted and owed\n\nThe following tables show the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Board of Management.",

        "page_content": "## III.  REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD\n\n## 1. Articles of incorporation and procedure\n\nThe regulation governing remuneration for the Supervisory Board applicable to the reporting year was adopted by the Annual Gen/uni00AD eral Meeting on 14 May 2020. It is set out in Article 15 of the Articles of Incorporation, and specifies both the remuneration system to be used and the precise framework for calculating the remuneration due to the members of the Supervisory Board. The regulation was confirmed by the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 with a majority of 99.40% of the valid votes cast.\n\n## 2. Principles and elements of remuneration\n\nThe Supervisory Board remuneration is structured as a purely fixed remuneration. In its current form, the Supervisory Board remuneration complies with suggestion G.18 of the German Cor/uni00AD porate Governance Code as amended on 28 April 2022. Fixed remuneration strengthens the independence of the supervisory board in advising and monitoring the Board of Management. The structure and amount of the fixed remuneration ensure that high/uni00AD ly qualified individuals can be proposed to the Annual General Meeting for membership of the Supervisory Board. This promotes the quality of consulting and monitoring, which contributes to the company's sustainable and long/uni00ADterm development.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Incorporation, each member of the Supervisory Board of BMW/uni00A0AG who does not exercise any additional function relevant to remuneration receives - in addition to the reimbursement of reasonable expenses - fixed remuner/uni00AD ation of \u20ac/uni00A0200,000 p.a.\n\nThe latest version of the German Corporate Governance Code, dated 28 April 2022, recommends that exercising the functions of the chair and deputy chair of Supervisory Board should also\n\nbe considered when determining the level of remuneration, along with any committees an individual chairs or sits on (Suggestion G.17). This is to take account of the extra time commitment as/uni00AD sociated with these positions. In view of the particular demands placed on the members and, in particular, on the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the increased scope of the Audit Commit/uni00AD tee's tasks, a higher level of remuneration is provided for work on this committee than for work on other committees. Accord/uni00AD ingly, the Articles of Incorporation of BMW/uni00A0AG stipulate that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board shall receive three times the amount, and each Deputy Chairman twice the amount, of remu/uni00AD neration paid to a Supervisory Board member, excluding amounts relating to additional remuneration/uni00ADrelevant functions. The Chair of the Audit Committee receives two/uni00ADand/uni00ADa/uni00ADquarter times the amount, the Chair of other Supervisory Board committees twice the amount, each member of the Audit Committee twice the amount, and each member of a committee one/uni00ADand/uni00ADa/uni00ADhalf times the amount of the remuneration paid to a Supervisory Board member, provided the relevant committee convened on at least three days during the financial year. If a member of the Supervi/uni00AD sory Board exercises more than one of the functions referred to above, their remuneration is measured only on the basis of the function receiving the highest amount.\n\nIn the event of changes in the composition of the Supervisory Board during the year, or if additional remuneration/uni00ADrelevant functions are performed, remuneration is determined on a pro/uni00AD portionate basis.\n\nIn addition, each member of the Supervisory Board receives an attendance fee of \u20ac/uni00A02,000 per meeting for each meeting of the Supervisory Board (plenary) in which he or she participates. This also applies to participation by telephone or video link. If they attend more than one meeting on the same day, the meetings are not remunerated separately. A continuous session on two consecutive days is treated as one session.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation, the remuneration and the attendance fee are only paid after the end of the respective financial year. Furthermore, the company reimburses each member of the Supervisory Board for their rea/uni00AD sonable expenses. In order to be able to perform his duties, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is provided with secretariat and chauffeur services.\n\n## 3. Remuneration granted and owed to members of the Supervisory Board pursuant to \u00a7 162/uni00A0German Stock Corporation Act (AktG)\n\nThe following table shows the remuneration granted and owed to the members of the Supervisory Board in the 2022 financial year in accordance with \u00a7 162/uni00A0(1) Sentence/uni00A01/uni00A0German Stock Cor/uni00AD poration Act (AktG). The activity on which the remuneration for the 2022 financial year is based was fully performed by the bal/uni00AD ance sheet date. Therefore, the remuneration for the Superviso/uni00AD ry Board activities is classified as granted for the 2022 financial year, even if the payment of the Supervisory Board remuneration (including the attendance fee) was made after the end of the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Overview of remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board\u00b9\n\n|                                           | Factor                              | Amount in/uni00A0\u20ac  p.a. /uni200A3                         |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Member of Supervisory Board               | /one.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf   | /two.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf   |\n| Chairman Supervisory Board                | /three.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf | /six.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf   |\n| Deputy Chairman Supervisory Board         | /two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf   | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Chairman of the Audit Committee /uni200A2 | /two.tf/period.tf/two.tf/five.tf    | /four.tf/five.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Chairman of other committee /uni200A2     | /two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf   | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Member of the Audit Committee /uni200A2   | /two.tf/period.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf   | /four.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf  |\n| Member of other committee /uni200A2       | /one.tf/period.tf/five.tf/zero.tf   | /three.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf/zero.tf |",

AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nBayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft Munich\n\nRemuneration Report pursuant to \u00a7 162/uni00A0AktG for the Financial Year from 1/uni00A0January to 31/uni00A0December 2022\n\n## Auditor's Report\n\nTo Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, Munich\n\nWe have audited the remuneration report of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, Munich, for the financial year from 1 January 2022 to/uni00A031/uni00A0December 2022, including the related disclo/uni00AD sures, which was prepared to comply with \u00a7 162/uni00A0of the German Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## Responsibility of the Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board\n\nThe executive directors and the supervisory board of Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the prepa/uni00AD ration of the remuneration report, including the related disclo/uni00AD sures, which complies with the requirements of \u00a7 162/uni00A0German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). The executive directors and the supervisory board are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of a remuneration report, including the related disclosures, that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on this remuneration report, including the related disclosures, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with German generally ac/uni00AD cepted standards for the audit of financial statements as prom/uni00AD ulgated by the Institute of Public Auditors in Germany (IDW). Those standards stipulate that we comply with ethical require/uni00AD ments and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable as/uni00AD surance as to whether the remuneration report, including the related disclosures, is free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts including the related disclosures stated in the remuneration report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the remuneration report including the related disclosures, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures. The objective of this is to plan and per/uni00AD form audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effective/uni00AD ness of the company's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the exec/uni00AD utive directors and the supervisory board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the remuneration report including the related disclosures.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Audit Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the remuner/uni00AD ation report for the financial year from 1 January to 31/uni00A0December 2022, including the related disclosures, complies in all material respects with the accounting provisions of \u00a7 162/uni00A0AktG.\n\n## Reference to Another Matter - Formal Audit of the Remuneration Report According to \u00a7 162/uni00A0AktG\n\nThe audit of the content of the remuneration report described in this auditor's report includes the formal audit of the remuneration report required by \u00a7 162/uni00A0(3)/uni00A0AktG, including the issuance of a re/uni00AD port on this audit. As we express an unqualified opinion on the content of the remuneration report, this audit includes an opinion on whether the information required by \u00a7 162/uni00A0(1) and (2)/uni00A0AktG has been disclosed in all material respects in the remuneration report.\n\nVII.  Auditor's Report\n\n## Restriction on use\n\nWe issue this audit opinion on the basis of the engagement con/uni00AD cluded with Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft. The audit has been performed only for purposes of the company and the auditor's report is solely intended to inform the company as to the results of the audit. Our responsibility for the audit and for our auditor's report is only towards the company in accordance with this engagement. The auditor's report is not intended to be relied on by third parties in making investment and/or asset man/uni00AD agement decisions. We do not assume any responsibility, duty of care or liability towards third parties; no third parties are in/uni00AD cluded in the scope of afforded under this contract. Section 334 BGB [B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch: German Civil Code], according to which objections arising from a contract may also be raised against third parties, is not waived.\n\nMunich, 8 March 2022\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft\n\nPetra Justenhoven\n\nMichael Popp Auditor\n\nAuditor",

emissions.\n- 2 Carbon emissions (excluding climate/uni00ADchanging gases other than carbon dioxide) generated by vehicle production (BMW Group plants including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. and Motorrad, excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) and by other BMW Group locations not directly related to production (e.g. research centres, sales centres, office buildings).\n- 3 Calculation of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using the operational control approach in accordance with the GHG Protocol. Leased space without the direct influence of the BMW Group on energy supply is therefore not included.\n- 4 Scope 2 emissions calculated using the market/uni00ADbased method in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance; mainly the use of the VDA emissions factors for electricity, district heating and fuel (each in the current valid version: 12/2022) and in some cases the use of local emissions factors; alternative calculation using the location/uni00ADbased method: /uni00A01,187,339 /uni00A0t/uni00A0 CO2. The decrease in carbon emissions compared to the previous year is mainly due to the adjustment of the emission factors.\n- 5 Includes all refuelling of function/uni00ADrelated vehicles within Germany and at the international test sites of Oxnard and Woodcliff Lake (USA), Arjeplog (Sweden) and Miramas (France). All European refuellings of company vehicles registered in Germany are also included. For systemic reasons, the refuellings of company vehicles include both business and private trips, except refuelling paid for by employees themselves.\n- 6 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also partially included under employee commuting and utilisation phase (both Scope 3). A system/uni00ADrelated distinction is not currently possible.\n- 7 The year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear increase in emissions is particularly due to the expansion of refuelling authorisations from Germany to Europe in November 2021.",

Due to the resulting adjustments to emissions factors, the average CO2e intensity has increased by approximately 15 %. As a result, the prior/uni00ADyear figures are not directly comparable. Due to the systems in place, the retroactive adjustment of prior/uni00ADyear figures is not possible.\n- 2 Includes business trips made by plane, train and rental cars.\n- 3 Since the 2022 reporting year, the flight date has been used instead of the date on which the ticket was created to determine carbon emissions from flights. Due to the systems in place, the prior/uni00ADyear figures cannot be adjusted. This leads to a one/uni00ADoff double counting of carbon emissions from flights (approx. 3,700 tonnes) booked in 2021 that took place in 2022. The increase in carbon emissions from business trips compared to the two previous years is also attributable to the lifting of travel restrictions imposed during the Covid/uni00AD19 pandemic.\n- 4 Emissions from company cars (Scope 1) are also partially included under employee commuting and utilisation phase (both Scope 3). A system/uni00ADrelated distinction is not currently possible.\n- 5 The figures from 2020 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years due to the improved data basis. In some cases, figures have been extrapolated based on data collected at major national and international BMW Group locations.\n- 6 Based on life cycle assessments in accordance with ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles of the product lines using the LCA tool GaBi provided by the company Sphera (including  the climate/uni00ADimpacting gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6 and NF3). Corresponding with the CO2e emissions, the energy consumption values resulting from the life cycle assessments (lower calorific value) are as follows: approx. 92,749,162 MWh in the 'Purchased goods and services' category and around 706,565 MWh in the 'Disposal' category.\n- 7 The absolute emissions in the utilisation phase are based on the /uni2197 carbon emissions for the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions. The total value in tonnes of carbon is the result of multiplying the average value with all BMW Group vehicles sold in the reporting period and an assumed average mileage of 200,000 km (as per VDA 900/uni00AD100).\n- 8 The year/uni00ADon/uni00ADyear increase in carbon emissions is due to the strong sales growth for electrified vehicles, particularly all/uni00ADelectric vehicles.\n- 9 The carbon reductions achieved in the year under report resulting from measures agreed with suppliers were not taken into account when calculating the carbon footprint.

Due to the resulting adjustments to emissions factors, the average CO2e intensity has increased by approximately 15 %. As a result, the prior/uni00ADyear figures are not directly comparable. Due to the systems in place, the retroactive adjustment of prior/uni00ADyear figures is not possible.\n- 2 Figures relate to vehicle production (BMW Group including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. and partner plants, excluding contract manufacturing) and spare parts deliveries to centralised parts distribution centres.

Based on an average vehicle weight of  BMW Group vehicles of around 1.9 tonnes, the total weight of input materials is around 4.3 million tonnes. To calculate the individual material flows, the total weight is multiplied by the average distribution of the materials in BMW Group vehicles.\n\n## Potable water consumption per vehicle\n\n1, 2, 3, 4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmanufactured\n\n- 1 Efficiency ratio calculated on the basis of potable water consumption in vehicle production (BMW Group manufacturing sites incl. BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing) divided by the total number of vehicles produced (BMW Group manufacturing sites incl. BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd. and partner plants, excluding contract manufacturing).\n- 2 Potable water consumption refers to water obtained from an external water company. If a site does not obtain any water from an external water company, the main source is considered equivalent to potable water. This applies to the BMW Group plants in San/uni00A0Luis/uni00A0Potos\u00ed, Mexico and Araquari, Brazil, where groundwater is the main source.\n- 3 Potable water consumption per vehicle produced replaces the previously reported efficiency indicator of water consumption per vehicle produced. The previous year's figures have been adjusted for comparison purposes (2018 prior to adjustment: 2.39; 2019 prior to adjustment: 2.32; 2020 prior to adjustment 2.25; 2021 prior to adjustment: 2.15).\n- 4 Value of the base year 2016 to the target reduction of -25 % by 2030: 2.00 (2016 prior to adjustment: 2.25).\n\n## Water consumption /uni200A1\n\n| in m 3                      | 2018                                                                        | 2019                                                                       | 2020                                                                      | 2021                                                                        | 2022                                                                     |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Water consumption           | /five.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/two.tf/five.tf/comma.tf/zero.tf/seven.tf/three.tf | /five.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/one.tf/seven.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/two.tf/eight.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/seven.tf/two.tf/two.tf/comma.tf/three.tf/one.tf/zero.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/nine.tf/two.tf/four.tf/comma.tf/four.tf/seven.tf/seven.tf | /four.tf/comma.tf/eight.tf/four.tf/zero.tf/comma.tf/one.tf/six.tf/one.tf |\n| of which potable water in % | /nine.tf/zero.tf/period.tf/four.tf                                          | /eight.tf/seven.tf/period.tf/four.tf                                       | /eight.tf/six.tf/period.tf/three.tf                                       | /eight.tf/five.tf/period.tf/one.tf                                          | /eight.tf/four.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                      |\n| of which groundwater in %   | /nine.tf/period.tf/six.tf                                                   | /one.tf/two.tf/period.tf/six.tf                                            | /one.tf/three.tf/period.tf/six.tf                                         | /one.tf/four.tf/period.tf/six.tf                                            | /one.tf/five.tf/period.tf/seven.tf                                       |\n| of which surface water in % | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                                  | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                                 | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                                | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                                  | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                               |\n| of which rainwater in %     | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                                  | /zero.tf/period.tf/zero.tf                                                 | /zero.tf/period.tf/one.tf                                                 | /zero.tf/period.tf/three.tf                                                 | /zero.tf/period.tf/three.tf                                              |\n\n- 1 Water consumed by vehicle production (BMW Group plants, including BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd., excluding partner plants and contract manufacturing).\n\nFurther GRI Information",

In line with its corporate strategy, the BMW Group is pursuing a  course of decarbonisation. Against a backdrop of increasing elec/uni00AD trification, it is particularly important to consider carbon emissions  over the entire life cycle of a vehicle. In this context, the  BMW Group has set itself decarbonisation targets by 2030 (base  year 2019) during the use phase, in the upstream supply chain  and in production. These have been registered with the SBTi and  validated (/uni2197/uni00A0Decarbonisation targets across the supply chain in  detail). The BMW Group is also taking measures to mitigate and  adapt to climate change. This includes identifying climate/uni00ADrelated  risks and opportunities and taking appropriate account of them in  the strategic direction to be followed, in corporate governance, |",

The information is based on a vehicle with basic equipment in Germany. Ranges take into account differences in wheel and tyre size selected as well as optional equipment and can change based on configuration. The figures have been calculated based on the new WLTP test cycle and adapted to NEDC for comparison purposes. For vehicles that were newly type approved on or after\n\n1 January 2021, official figures are only based on WLTP. In the vehicles, different figures than those published here may apply for the assessment of taxes and other vehicle/uni00ADrelated duties which are also based on CO2 emissions.

This excludes apprentices, interns, temporary staff (working students), temporary employees, dormant/inactive em/uni00AD ployment contracts due to maternity leave, sabbaticals, parental leave, long/uni00ADterm illness (as defined in the country in question), those in inactive early retirement phase, and employees accom/uni00AD panying their partner abroad. Up to 2019, temporary staff, post/uni00AD graduate students, interns, apprentices, and people on extended sick leave or on sabbatical were also included in this definition.\n\n## Bond\n\nA securitised debt instrument in which the issuer certifies its obligation to repay the nominal amount at the end of a fixed term and to pay a fixed or variable rate of interest.\n\n## Business volume in balance sheet terms\n\nThe sum of the balance sheet line items 'Leased products' and 'Receivables from sales financing' (current and non/uni00ADcurrent), as reported in the balance sheet for the Financial Services segment.\n\nC\n\n## Capitalisation rate\n\nCapitalised development costs as a percentage of research and development expenditure.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nLiquid funds generated (cash inflows) or used (cash outflows) during a reporting period.\n\n## Cash flow at risk\n\nSimilar to 'value at risk' (see definition below).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nHedges against exposures to the variability in forecasted cash flows, particularly in connection with exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## CO2e /CO2 equivalent\n\nCO2e is a unit of measurement used to standardise the climate impact of various greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, such as methane or nitrous oxide. This is necessary because the individual gases do not all contribute to the greenhouse effect to the same degree. To this end, the expert committee at the United Nations (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) has defined 'global warming potential' (GWP). This is an index used to ex/uni00AD press warming impact compared with CO2 so that all GHGs are aggregated. For example, over a period of 100 years, methane has 28 times the impact of CO2, while for nitrous oxide the impact is 265 times higher. Carbon emissions in the supply chain, including in transport logistics, as well as in the upstream fuel production (well/uni00ADto/uni00ADtank) are stated as CO2e. Greenhouse gases under Scope 1 and 2 are not recognised for reasons of materiality.\n\n## CO2e emissions in the supply chain (Scope 3 upstream) and in disposal (Scope 3 downstream)\n\nCO2e emissions in the supply chain and in disposal in tonnes of CO2e are based on T\u00dcV/uni00ADcertified life cycle assessments per ISO 14040/44 of representative vehicles of the types produced  during the reporting year. This is calculated using the GaBi LCA tool pro/uni00AD vided by Sphera (considering the greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, N2O, SF6 and NF3). Emissions resulting from the components and materials in the manufactured vehicles are taken into account.",

The carbon emissions result from energy consumption in the BMW Group plants as well as non/uni00ADmanufacturing sites. Electricity from in/uni00AD ternally operated solar PV, direct supply agreements for green electricity and certified proof of origin are all taken into account. The conversion is based on the VDA's emissions factors for elec/uni00AD tricity, district heating and fuels in the most current valid version and isolated local emissions factors. This key indicator is the basis for measuring the strategic target by 2030 with regard to Scope 1 and/uni00A02 emissions. The reporting indicator is t/uni00A0CO2 per vehicle manufactured.\n\n## Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet in the EU (Scope 3 downstream)\n\nThe average carbon emissions of a manufacturer's fleet (utilisa/uni00AD tion phase) are calculated on the basis of the weighted average of carbon emissions across all vehicles newly registered during the reporting period. New registrations for these purposes com/uni00AD prise all newly registered vehicles of a given manufacturer in the EU, including Norway and Iceland, during the calendar year, plus any individual vehicle/uni00ADspecific carbon emissions determined in accordance with the WLTP type test procedure. In a few countries (</uni200A5/uni200A% of the vehicle volume), no monthly registration figures are available at the time of calculation. In these cases,  deliveries are used. The BMW Group's fleet carbon emissions figure, as meas/uni00AD ured internally, includes legally permitted offsetting of eco/uni00ADin/uni00AD novations of minor importance. The performance indicator for reporting purposes is g CO2 per kilometre driven.\n\n## Carbon emissions of the new vehicle fleet worldwide, including upstream emissions (Scope 3 downstream, well/uni00ADto/uni00ADwheel)\n\nThis indicator documents the progress made by the BMW Group in its strategic objective of reducing carbon emissions during the utilisation phase including upstream emissions (drivetrain energy supply) by an average rate of at least 50 % per kilometre driven by 2030 (base year 2019). For the purpose of this calculation, the volume/uni00ADweighted average fleet carbon emissions are calculated for the core markets EU (27 EU countries incl. Norway and Iceland; plus UK) (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure; basis: production volume), USA (driving cycle: United States Combined; basis: production volume) and China (driving cycle: Worldwide Harmonized Test Cycle, subject to China/uni00ADspe/uni00AD cific framework conditions for testing; basis: import volumes/local production volumes; incl. BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd.) before deduction of legally permitted offsetting factors (e.g. supercred/uni00AD its and eco/uni00ADinnovations) and then standardised according to the WLTP (European) driving cycle. These core markets account for more than 80 % of the BMW Group's sales. The calculated figures are increased by 10 % to account for possible discrepancies be/uni00AD tween cycle values and real emissions, as required by the Science Based Targets Initiative. This indicator also includes the upstream emissions for the respective energy sources (fossil fuels and elec/uni00AD tricity used for charging), in line with the /uni2197/uni00A0 Well/uni00ADto/uni00ADwheel approach . This covers the entire impact chain behind vehicle motion, i.e. from the generation and supply of power to its conversion into drivetrain energy. This approach also includes the environmental impacts associated with the supply of energy. For example, to calculate the volume of emissions resulting from upstream electricity (drivetrain energy supply), the BMW Group uses the energy report published by the International Energy Agency (IEA; reference base: previous year) as a basis in order to assess the emissions associated with the electricity mix in its core markets. The performance indicator for reporting purposes is g CO2 per kilometre driven.\n\n## Carbon/uni00ADreducing measures in the supply chain\n\nThe saved greenhouse gas emissions (in CO2 e) in the supply chain result from the sum of the carbon/uni00ADreducing measures implemented by suppliers in the reporting year. The focus is on carbon/uni00ADintensive components and materials required for the manufacture of BMW Group vehicles. The potential carbon footprint for these components and materials before the implementation of measures is initially determined using the LCA tool GaBi provided by Sphera on the basis of the type and quantity of material. The carbon/uni00ADreducing measures, including the use of green electricity and  secondary raw materi/uni00AD als, are then verified by an external auditor before being taken into account. When calculating the carbon footprint in 2022, measures affecting individual components are assigned in a simplified man/uni00AD ner to the EU manufacturing region and corresponding emissions factors. Emissions/uni00ADintensive materials and battery cells are taken into account on the basis of their actual manufacturing region.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nDeep/uni00ADdiscounted bonds with a term of less than one year.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe process of combining separate financial statements of Group entities into Group Financial Statements, depicting the financial position, net assets and results of operations of the Group as a single economic entity.\n\n## Credit default swap (CDS)\n\nFinancial swap agreements, under which creditors of securities (usually bonds) pay premiums to the seller of the CDS to hedge against the risk that the issuer of the bond will default.
