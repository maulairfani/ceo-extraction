This context of uncertainty is a rallying call to action, with new energy approaches now available to address the common need for moderation, sovereignty and decarbonization. With the requisite tools in hand, Air Liquide is proposing innovative solutions and inventing a sustainable future.\n\nI am therefore confident in our future. Since its creation, our Group has demonstrated its ability to take action regardless of the situation, with the past three years being the most recent proof of this. Our confidence is driven by our capacity to anticipate and design the solutions of the future, and we continuously invest in new technologies to support the industrial, electronics and healthcare sectors in their journey toward progress.\n\nMy confidence in the future is also founded on our capacity for adaptation. Our strength lies in our ability to respond to global transformations and constantly expanding our activities with solutions for our customers, all while addressing the major issues that impact society as a whole.\n\nFinally, I am a fervent believer in the power of the collective, which has always been a cornerstone of our business model. Together with our employees, alongside our customers and our partners, and with the support of our shareholders, we have shown resilience and agility in initiating the transition toward a low-carbon society. But for future generations, we must pick up the pace. Our contribution to shared progress gives very strong significance to our individual and collective action. It is both what motivates us and what drives us forward.",

What can you tell us about the Group's performance?\n\nThat it is very solid! In 2022, we achieved another year of profitable growth despite a complex and changing environment. Our reported sales reached 29.9 billion euros, up +7% (1) , and recurring net income grew by +17% (2) . All our businesses - Gas & Services, Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies - are up significantly. Within Gas & Services, all our geographies are growing, in particular the Americas and Asia-Pacific.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank them. In addition to revenue growth, we have further improved our operating margin thanks to significant efficiency gains and the dynamic management of our business portfolio. Moreover, in the context of rising energy prices, the Group has demonstrated its ability to create value, enabling it to adjust prices for customers. The quality of these results illustrates both the resilience of our business model and the mobilization and responsiveness of our teams, who have done a remarkable job in adapting to a volatile environment.\n\nI would also like to add that our investment momentum, which is the guarantee of our future growth, has accelerated, particularly in regard to hydrogen and the transition to a low-carbon society. Indeed, our investments have reached a record level of nearly 4 billion euros. Finally, in terms of extra-financial aspects, our CO2 emissions (3) have remained stable for the second year in a row. This supports our goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nThese results show that ADVANCE, our strategic plan combining our financial and non-financial trajectory for 2025, is already bearing fruit. On the basis of this performance, we look forward to 2023 with confidence.",

        "page_content": "## INTERVIEW WITH FRAN\u00c7OIS JACKOW\n\n## The energy crisis, inflation, war in Europe\u2026 economic and geopolitical instability seems to be taking hold. Will this have an impact on Air Liquide's strategic roadmap?\n\nWithout a doubt, 2022 was defined by a range of geopolitical, energy and climate-related crises, which have obviously had an impact on our customers, our activities and society as a whole. However, this complex year confirmed more than ever the relevance of our roadmap, as our ADVANCE strategic plan was designed to provide innovative solutions to challenges that are here to stay. The current context has therefore acted as an accelerator, strengthening our resolve to move forward with a clear goal: pursuing our global performance trajectory by combining financial and extra-financial performance.\n\nThis ambition is based on an extremely solid foundation, built on the Group's proven resilience; the robustness of our business model based on the diversity of our business lines and geographical footprint; and of course, our teams, who demonstrated yet again this year their ability to respond to all challenges. And, with ADVANCE, we are now positioned at the heart of the energy transition and are focused on the markets of the future, such as hydrogen mobility, electronics, healthcare and high technologies. All this provides Air Liquide with an unprecedented positioning in terms of the current global upheavals, and an excellent opportunity to propel the Group into the future.\n\n## Amidst all these challenges, you have made the climate crisis and decarbonization a priority.\n\nIndeed. My aim is to make Air Liquide the champion of climate solutions. This is an urgent priority for the planet, and for us all. At Air Liquide, we are already able to provide tangible solutions to the major challenges of decarbonizing industrial activities. Moreover, our solutions apply to both our own activities and those of our customers. Our expertise and our thorough understanding of their needs means we can help our customers meet their climate commitments.\n\nFor example, we are developing large-scale hydrogen technologies for industry and mobility, and I am proud to say that we have been pioneers in this field. We are also established in CO2 capture, biomethane and oxy-combustion, all areas that are in growing demand. We therefore offer a wide range of technologies based on our key molecules. This is something our customers appreciate, as shown by our recently formed strategic partnerships with cement manufacturer Eqiom, refiner ENI and aircraft manufacturer Airbus.\n\n## You have mentioned hydrogen as a solution for the future. What are the challenges involved with accelerating growth in this field?\n\nThe subject is no longer a matter of debate. Hydrogen has a major role to play in the decarbonization of industry and heavy transport. Its potential is huge, but we have many collective challenges to tackle before it can fully contribute to the energy transition. Industrial players clearly have a role to play, but it is necessary to build an entire ecosystem around this technology. To do so, political strategies need to be implemented that promote the development of new decarbonized usages, common regulation and, of course, support from investors and consumer adherence.\n\nThis means developing new usages in sectors such as steel and road transportation. We have established our low-carbon and renewable hydrogen production capacities. To do so, we intend to invest a minimum of \u20ac8 billion in the low-carbon hydrogen value chain by 2035. One example is the Group's largest renewable\n\nseveral partnerships to collectively support the opening of these new markets. Additionally, it means increasing hydrogen production unit in Normandy, France, which is under construction and will be commissioned in 2025. which is under construction and will\n\nWe have also signed long-term contracts with industrial players in Europe to supply them with low-carbon hydrogen. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (4) will also create several opportunities in this respect. Driven by this unprecedented global momentum, we aim to triple sales, from \u20ac2 billion to \u20ac6 billion by 2035. We have also signed be commissioned in 2025.",

        "page_content": "## \u00ab Our ADVANCE strategic plan\n\nwas designed to provide innovative solutions to challenges that are here to stay. \u00bb\n\n## In addition to decarbonization, what are the other principal growth drivers for Air Liquide?\n\nAir Liquide's major strength has always been its dynamic and diversified business portfolio, which is rich in potential sources of growth. I would like to mention two. First, electronics, where Air Liquide is currently the leading supplier of ultra-high purity gases and advanced materials. A real revolution is taking place in this sector. The semiconductors market is growing rapidly, driven by the rapid development of artificial intelligence and connected objects, as well as by an increased need for North American and European sovereignty. This is evidenced by the establishment of several 'megafabs (5) ' projects. We are currently reinforcing our leadership position in these geographic areas.\n\nOur second major source of growth is of course healthcare, and in particular home healthcare. This is a sector that is continuing to evolve, after having demonstrated its central role during the public health crisis. Our Group is making a contribution. Both at hospital and at home, our activity is committed to a transformation toward value-added offers for patients and healthcare professionals. By offering personalized support and innovative solutions, we aim to improve the quality of life of patients at the best cost for the healthcare system.\n\n(5)\n\n## You have been leading the Group since June 2022. How do you see the rest of the year?\n\nWith energy and determination. But also with a great deal of composure, owing to my confidence in the unwavering commitment of our teams, regardless of what the future may hold.\n\nSince my appointment, I regularly meet with our teams, and every time I do, I am impressed with their proactive approach in a context which frankly had the potential to be unsettling. From one side of the globe to the other, I have seen the same commitment to satisfying our customers, the same desire to advance, innovate and create an impact. This is a great source of pride for me as a leader, and I am deeply grateful to them.\n\nThe coming months will without a doubt be complex and full of surprises. But we are ready and determined to meet the needs and expectations expressed by our customers and patients, and to invent a more sustainable future together.",

This was one of the reasons why Air Liquide set its sites internationally early on, building numerous production units abroad. Development was rapid in Europe (1906), Japan (1907), Canada (1911) and the United States (1916).\n\n## LISTING ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE\n\nThe  critical  role played  by  Shareholders  became  evident  in the first years of  the Company's development. Listed  on the Paris Stock Exchange in 1913, the share celebrated its hundredth year of listing in 2013. During these 100 years, Air Liquide has endeavored to forge a strong and privileged relationship with its Shareholders based on exceptional stock market performance, with an average annual increase in its share price of +11.9%.\n\n## REVOLUTIONARY DISTRIBUTION METHODS\n\nIn the 1950' Air Liquide put in place new ways to distribute industrial gases.\n\nStoring gas in liquid form in cryogenic tanks allows vast quantities to be transported by road or rail within a radius of approximately 200-250 km from the production site.\n\nBy delivering gas to several customers through pipelines, Air Liquide adopted a network strategy for the first time, linking its gas production units to one another. The Group increased its production capacity to meet soaring demand from large industries: firstly, for oxygen in the steel industry, and secondly, for nitrogen in chemicals.  This marked the start-up  of the Large Industries business.\n\n## 1960-2000\n\n## SPACE INDUSTRY\n\nConvinced of the industrial potential of cryogenics, Jean Delorme, Chairman &  CEO of  Air Liquide, decided to create a  research center dedicated to these technologies. This center was founded in 1962 near Grenoble in France. The first applications were rapidly integrated in the space industry and ever since Air Liquide has been a key partner of the space adventure.\n\n## A TRADITION OF INVENTIONS\n\nThe Claude Delorme Research Center, located on the Saclay plateau and now called the Innovation Campus Paris, was created in 1970. The research center's work is focused on enhancing gas production technologies and their  applications.  It  is  evidence  of the Group's desire to better understand the industrial processes of its  customers and develop new gas applications to better satisfy their requirements. Today, the Group also has Innovation Campuses  in  Europe (France, Germany),  North America (USA) and Asia (China, Japan).\n\n## A NEW MARKET: ELECTRONICS\n\nIn Japan,  the Group began in 1985 to supply ultra-high purity gases to the semiconductor industry: this involves carrier gases, mainly nitrogen, used to transport the specialty gases and keep the chip production tools inert, and specialty gases that are used directly in the manufacturing of semiconductors. In 1987, Air  Liquide  inaugurated  the Tsukuba Research Center in Japan, which is dedicated to the electronics industry.\n\n## MAJOR ACQUISITION\n\nThe Group acquired  Big  Three  in  the United States  in  1986,  a Large Industries business with a significant pipeline network along the Gulf Coast.\n\n## EXTENDED OFFERING: HYDROGEN AND STEAM\n\nIn addition to oxygen and nitrogen, Air Liquide extended its offering to hydrogen and steam in the 90s. To ensure the success of this new offering, the Group used its business model, which is behind the success of its air gas business, and deployed from the beginning a basin strategy based on a pipeline network, providing customers with flexibility, distribution reliability and service quality at the best price.\n\n## HEALTHCARE\n\nOriginally  an  oxygen supplier to hospitals, Air Liquide became a specialist in the healthcare sector. The Group launched its Home Healthcare business in the 1990' and set up a dedicated network of  specialist  teams. Medical  gases  were  progressively classified as drugs and manufacturers were required to file market authorizations. The  Group also launched research programs in therapeutic gases, used for resuscitation and pain relief.",

        "page_content": "## 2000-2020\n\n## INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION\n\nThe  Group invested  massively  in China  in  the  early  2000s; the country has been a major growth market for industrial gases and Air Liquide entered into numerous air gas contracts.\n\nThe Group acquired part of Messer Griesheim's activities in Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n## ORGANIZATION BY BUSINESS LINE\n\nThe Air Liquide growth drivers for the coming decades are based on changing lifestyles: industrial growth of developing economies, increasing energy needs and environmental challenges, healthcare and high technology. To capture this growth, the Group created a new organizational structure based on four World Business Lines. They combine the technical and operational expertise which are specific to each of the businesses of the Group -Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics - and centralize the specific market expertise.\n\nConscious of the strategic dimension of Engineering & Construction capabilities, the Group acquired Lurgi in 2007. This company provides Air Liquide with major proprietary technologies, notably hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units, adding to the Group's historical competencies in cryogenics.\n\n## RESILIENCE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS\n\nAffected by a global economic crisis of unprecedented magnitude in 2008 and 2009, the Group focused its efforts on the management of its cash, costs, and investments (capital expenditures). Having tested the solidity of its long-term contracts, Air Liquide demonstrated the relevance and resilience of its business model. In a context of global recession, the Group showed itself to be an exception, posting a stable net profit while preserving the strength of its balance sheet.\n\n## INNOVATION AND HYDROGEN\n\nInnovation is central to Air Liquide's strategy. In 2013, Air Liquide launched two initiatives to promote open innovation: i-Lab (innovation Lab) and ALIAD, the Group's capital venture entity to take minority investments in  innovative  technology start-ups.  In 2014, the Group decided on new investments such as the modernization of the Research Center near Versailles, on the Saclay plateau, the creation of a center for the development and industrialization of gas cylinders for industry and healthcare, and the launch of a technical center of excellence for cryogenic production technologies.\n\nIn addition, on a worldwide scale, Air Liquide actively contributes to the development of the hydrogen energy activity by supporting automotive manufacturers launching Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles on the market. Air Liquide contributes to the construction of hydrogen refueling stations (United States, Japan, France, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Korea, China\u2026).\n\n## AIRGAS ACQUISITION BY AIR LIQUIDE AND NEOS PROGRAM\n\nOn May 23, 2016, Air Liquide completed  the acquisition of the American company Airgas and took a new dimension. This acquisition was complementary to the Group's businesses in the United States  and  enabled Air  Liquide  to  be present  across all market segments  both  upstream  of  and  downstream  to  the US market; this integration has created significant value.\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORT\n\n## History of the Air Liquide Group\n\nIn addition to the 300 million US dollars of synergies targeted by the Group  through  this acquisition, Air Liquide  believes  that  the Airgas model, in terms of products, digitization of businesses, and business model, may be applied outside the United States.\n\nWith this acquisition,  Air Liquide strengthens its position in the United States,  the largest industrial  gas  market worldwide.  This market also enjoys the strongest growth among advanced economies.\n\nFollowing this acquisition Air Liquide published its new mid-term Company program, NEOS, on July 6, 2016. Its strategy for profitable growth over the long term is that of a customer-centric transformation. It is based on operational excellence and the quality of  its investments, on open  innovation and the  network organization already implemented by the Group worldwide.\n\n## CREATION OF THE GLOBAL MARKETS & TECHNOLOGIES BUSINESS\n\nTo step up the development of offerings in new markets, the Group created in 2016 the Global Markets & Technologies business, responsible for developing new activities in the field of energy transition and deep tech, by leveraging technologies.\n\n## REFOCUSING ON GAS & SERVICES BUSINESSES\n\nFollowing the divestiture of its Aqua Lung (diving) and Air Liquide Welding (welding) subsidiaries in 2017, Air Liquide focused on its Gas & Services businesses. After these divestitures, the share of Gas & Services revenue in  Group  sales increased  from  90% in 2015 to 96% in 2018.\n\n## ENERGY TRANSITION AND CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nFor many years now, Air Liquide has been committed to sustainable growth aimed, in particular, at limiting its CO2 emissions and  those  of  its customers.  On  November 30,  2018, Air Liquide announced its climate objectives, in particular a 30% reduction in its  carbon intensity  between 2015 and 2025, with a global approach  that  includes its  assets, its  customers, and its ecosystems. These objectives are the most ambitious in the sector  and  are  in  line  with  the  NEOS  company  program.  In this respect, the Global Markets & Technologies activity is stepping up sales to energy transition-related markets, driven by the biomethane sector  and  the first developments  in  the hydrogen mobility\n\n## FINALIZATION OF THE INTEGRATION OF AIRGAS AND STRENGTHENING OF THE GROUP'S EFFICIENCY PROGRAM\n\nAt the beginning of 2019, Air Liquide reached its target of 300  million US dollars  in synergies, thanks  to  the  integration  of Airgas, more than a year before initially planned. With the integration complete, Airgas joined the Group's efficiency program and  contributes  to increasing  the annual  target for efficiencies. The Group efficiencies target was initially set at 300 million euros and was revised up, to more than 400 million euros, as of 2019. Moreover, a program aimed at promoting the sharing of the Airgas model has allowed close to 100 Group managers to immerse themselves in Airgas operations, and to step up the sharing of its best practices with other Group regions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group invested in a hydrogen production and liquefaction unit for the west coast of the United States and worked with its Steel customers to decarbonize steel production using hydrogen.\n\n## 2020-2022\n\n## MOBILIZATION OF THE GROUP AGAINST COVID-19\n\nThe Healthcare teams were highly mobilized to cope with the increasing demand for medical oxygen, supply equipment such as ventilators for hospitals, ensure stabilized patients can return home and guarantee chronic patients are continually monitored.\n\nIn a context of global health and economic crisis, the Group has once again proven its resilience. This crisis has also highlighted the contribution of the Group's activities to society as well as the commitment of its employees.\n\n## ACT FOR A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\nIn March 2021, the Group strengthened all of its sustainable development goals by detailing them around three axes.\n\nFirst, to ACT for a low-carbon society, in line with the Paris Agreement, by setting a target of carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate steps: the start of the reduction of its CO2\n\nemissions in absolute value around 2025 and a -33% decrease in its CO2  emissions from Scopes 1 and 2 by 2035 compared  to 2020. Air Liquide acted for climate in 2021, by initiating projects and partnerships for the decarbonization of industrial and mobility activities,  and  by announcing its participation in the largest fund dedicated to clean hydrogen infrastructure. The Group also acquired Sasol air separation units in South Africa and a TotalEnergies steam methane reformer in France while committing to a very significant decrease of their CO2 emissions.\n\nSecond, CARE for patients by improving the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases in mature economies and facilitating  access  to  medical  oxygen in  low-  and  middle-income countries. Already in place in Senegal, the initiative allows access to  medical oxygen to rural  communities  and  its deployment has started in South Africa.\n\nAnd third, TRUST as the base to engage with employees and to build the best-in-class governance.\n\n## LAUNCH OF THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN: ADVANCE\n\nIn  March 2022, Air Liquide presented ADVANCE (see page 37), its new strategic plan for 2025. It placed sustainable development at the heart of its strategy and combined financial and extrafinancial performance.  With  a strong  business  model which  has proven its resilience, with its innovation capacity and its technological know-how, the Group is particularly well positioned to continue its growth trajectory while contributing to respond efficiently to major economic, environmental and societal challenges.",

Description of activities\n\nThe Group classifies its activities as follows: Gas & Services, Engineering & Construction, Global Markets & Technologies, and all  serve  one  unique business, that of industrial gases. The four business lines comprising the Gas & Services activities are closely tied by a strong industrial mindset where proximity is key. The diagram on page 23 illustrates the sharing of production or distribution assets between the different business lines for a given geographic region. This efficient industrial network and its proximity with its customers allow Air Liquide to:\n\n- \u25a0 improve reliability;\n- \u25a0 optimize energy consumption, costs and logistics flow;\n- \u25a0 anticipate customers' needs;\n- \u25a0 understand changes in the markets;\n- \u25a0 and offer innovative solutions.\n\nThe synergies enjoyed by all of the Group's businesses are not limited to the industrial aspect, but also include scientific and technological expertise, the innovation approach, as well as Human Resources and financial management. The strong integration  of  the various  World  Business  Lines  thus allows  the Group to create  synergies,  become stronger and  to  grow  while creating long-term value.\n\n## 2022 GROUP REVENUE BY ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1. GAS & SERVICES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Gas  &  Services  businesses  include  four  World  Business Lines  to  better  support  changes  and  meet  the  needs  of  the various markets: Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Healthcare, and Electronics.\n\nGas  supply  relies  on  local  production  in  order  to  limit  transport costs.  Therefore,  Air  Liquide  gas  production  units  are  located throughout  the  world  and  can  supply  many  types  of  customers and  industries  with  the  relevant  volumes  and  services  required. Air  Liquide's  structure  is  made  up  of  a  base,  in  Paris,  and  four hubs: Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and Middle East and Africa. These hubs draw on the Group's expertise and presence in these geographic regions.\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries supplies industrial gases by operating major production units. It serves customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy sectors where high gas volumes call for a dedicated  plant  or  the  development  of  a  pipeline  network. Large Industries also supplies the Group's other business lines with  gases  which  are  then  packaged  and  delivered  to  their respective customers.\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant supplies a wide range of different gases, application  equipment  and  associated  services.  It  serves industries  and  professionals  that  require  smaller  quantities than  Large  Industries'  customers.  Gas  can  be  distributed  in bulk, in liquid form, or in cylinders, in gaseous form, for smaller quantities.  Finally,  small  production  units  can  be  installed locally for customers with larger gas needs, or in remote areas.\n- \u25a0 Healthcare supplies  medical  gases,  equipment  and  services to hospitals and also directly to patients in their homes. It also produces  and  distributes  healthcare  specialty  ingredients  for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, vaccine and nutrition markets.\n- \u25a0 Electronics supplies  gases,  materials  (complex  molecules) used  in  manufacturing  processes,  as  well  as  equipment  and services mainly used for the production of semiconductors, but also flat screens and photovoltaic panels.",

Business overview\n\nThe  Large  Industries  business  line  supplies  gas  and  energy solutions  to  customers  in  the  metals,  chemicals,  refining  and energy  industries,  which  are  essential  for  their  own  core businesses,  to  improve  process  efficiency  and  to  make  their plants  more  environmentally  friendly.  The  Large  Industries business  line  provides  oxygen,  nitrogen,  argon,  hydrogen  and carbon monoxide through its plants and its pipeline network. The Group also operates cogeneration plants to supply customers with steam and electricity.\n\nThe world leader in this sector, Air Liquide benefits from dedicated in-house  development  and  engineering  teams,  differentiating proprietary  technologies  and  rigorous  processes  for  selecting investments  and  carrying  out  projects.  The  largest  Large Industries  customers  are  looked  after  by  key  account  managers who have in-depth knowledge of customers' businesses, as well as of their projects, industrial processes and global structure. This allows  Large  Industries  to  maintain  close  contact  with  its customers,  thus  improving  the  Group's  responsiveness  and competitiveness in terms of meeting their needs.\n\n## 2022 LARGE INDUSTRIES REVENUE BY PRODUCT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 37% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n## b. Business model\n\nThe supply of gas is generally contracted for 15 years. For certain projects, this can be extended to 20 years and beyond. The signing  of  new  contracts  for  new  industrial  customers'  sites  is  a strong predictor of future growth. Within these contracts, the Group guarantees long-term service continuity and a high level of reliability with respect to the gas supply  via a high-performing industrial solution. In return, long-term gas supply contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through take-or-pay clauses, as well as the  indexation to variable costs (mainly  for electricity and natural gas) and to inflation.\n\nThe use  of industrial gases is  critical  for the  various  industrial processes of Large Industries' customers. As any discontinuity in supply translates into an interruption of the customer's production operations, supply reliability and safety are crucial. However, although vital, gas supply generally represents a very small part of total production cost for the customer.\n\nThe Large Industries are at  the heart of  the energy transition, which creates major growth opportunities with the supply of lowcarbon gases as well as new modes of process and solutions for the customers' CO2 emissions reduction.\n\n## c. Large Industries industrial processes\n\nThe raw materials necessary for the production of industrial gases vary according to the type of gas and the location of the production unit. The production of  oxygen  and  nitrogen requires air and a large quantity of electricity. Cogeneration units consume natural gas and water. Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units mainly consume natural gas and little electricity. In 2021, the Group also inaugurated the  world's  largest  electrolysis  facility  in Canada that uses water and renewable hydroelectricity to produce low-carbon hydrogen. The energy and capital intensity of these industrial processes is generally high.\n\n## Air gases production (ASU: Air Separation Unit)\n\nAn Air Separation Unit (ASU) compresses, liquefies and distills air in order to separate it into its different components: 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon and noble gases (neon, krypton and xenon). Only certain large ASUs can produce noble gases. The ASUs do not emit directly CO2 but electricity consumption is significant. A simplified diagram of an ASU operation is presented on page 25.\n\n## Hydrogen and carbon monoxide production through steam reforming (SMR: Steam Methane Reformer)\n\nBy steam reforming natural gas, an SMR produces hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The most significant raw material is natural gas; electricity and water consumption is modest. A simplified diagram of a hydrogen unit's operation is presented on page 25. Air Liquide has  developed  a portfolio of CO2 capture solutions adapted to SMR, allowing to very significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Hydrogen production through electrolysis\n\nHydrogen production through electrolysis is based on the dissociation of water molecules (H2O) using electricity, to extract hydrogen and oxygen molecules. This process produces hydrogen without using or emitting carbon-based molecules. It can be used  to produce low-carbon hydrogen  for  industry and mobility,  as  well  as  for  energy storage.  A simplified  diagram  of hydrogen production through electrolysis is presented on page 26.\n\n## Cogeneration\n\nCogeneration consists of simultaneously and efficiently producing electricity and steam generally by consuming natural gas and water. The electricity is used by an Air Liquide plant or sold on the local network. The steam is required for certain industrial processes. This type of units directly emits CO2.",

Based on cryogenic distillation, adsorption, absorption, or separation membranes, these technologies are used to capture the carbon dioxide generated by Air Liquide's industrial  processes and those of its customers. Air Liquide proposes to its customers CO2 capture as a service on a typical Large Industries contract basis. These  solutions can  be installed,  for  example, at hydrogen  production units, petrochemical facilities,  or cement plants. Captured carbon dioxide is then permanently sequestered in a geological storage or used in the customer's processes, such as the treatment of alkaline water, or used by Industrial Merchant customers, to produce carbonated beverages, to package food in a protective atmosphere, or to prepare welding gas mixtures.",

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS\n\nThe chemicals industry uses mainly oxygen, hydrogen and carbon monoxide in its manufacturing processes, as well as nitrogen to inert its installations.\n\nThe refining industry requires hydrogen to desulfurize fuels and crack heavy hydrocarbons. The demand for hydrogen is growing steadily due to more stringent legislation aimed at reducing emissions and the  use of increasingly heavier hydrocarbons in fuel production.\n\nIn  the metals industry, Air Liquide supplies large volumes of oxygen to steel producers notably, the use of which improves their energy performance and reduces significantly their CO2 emissions. The majority  of  new projects  are  currently  located in developing economies.

Sales prices in Large Industries contracts are indexed, in particular, to energy and inflation costs. The long investment cycle and high capital intensity require a solid balance sheet. The signing of new contracts is  a  strong  predictor  of  future growth.\n\nAir Liquide is developing a pipeline network strategy in the industrial basins in order to provide customers with greater supply reliability while optimizing operating costs. This strategy allows to mutualize production assets and generate savings, notably on energy, on the overall Air Liquide network as well as for its customers.\n\nBy  developing its  capacity to deliver low-carbon  industrial  gases to  its clients and  other Group  businesses,  by  allowing  industrial processes decarbonization, and by offering carbon capture as a service, the Large Industries is crucial for the energy transition and the Group's decarbonization strategy.\n\nemissions, the Group is also taking part in a pilot project, with one of its steelmaking customers, which consists of injecting hydrogen at large scale to partially replace pulverized coal in blast furnaces, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions from the steel production process.\n\nNumerous industries linked to energy or chemicals use large quantities of oxygen to transform coal, natural gas, or liquid hydrocarbons into syngas for the production of chemical products, synfuel, or electricity.\n\nTo meet customer requirements, the supply of large quantities of gas is critical. Air Liquide supplies its customers directly by pipelines from a dedicated  plant or different plants  linked  by  a network. Air Liquide has built its  pipeline  networks  progressively over the last 40 years. With a total length of more than 9,700 kilometers (6,000 miles), these networks stretch, for example, across Northern Europe, from Rotterdam through to Dunkirk, and along the Gulf Coast in the United States from Lake Charles (Louisiana) to Corpus Christi (Texas) as well as along the Mississippi river in Louisiana. Many other mid-size local networks have also been built in other significant and fast-developing industrial basins in Germany, Italy, Singapore, and, more recently, China.",

Business overview\n\nThe  Industrial  Merchant  business  line  is,  by  its  nature,  a  highly local business, which provides more than two millions customers with  industrial  gases,  equipment,  hardgoods,  and  associated services.\n\nIndustrial  Merchant  provides  gas  using  the  supply  mode  best adapted to customers' needs: either via a small on-site production unit  for  customers  with  major  volume  requirements,  or  in  liquid form  distributed  by  trucks  for  medium-scale  quantities,  or  in cylinders  for  smaller  volumes  and  use  on  construction  sites. Around  95%  of  Industrial  Merchant's  customer  base  is  small customers  who  favor  simplicity,  flexibility  and  quality  of  service: they mainly order cylinder gas and hardgoods.\n\nThe Industrial Merchant activity serves a wide variety of markets, often essential to life. It constantly invents new applications for its molecules  that  address the challenges of  energy transition but also the challenges of new uses and markets and that contribute to improving the operational efficiency of its customers. The Industrial Merchant business manages a significant amount of data  from  the large number  of assets used  in operations along with the diversity of markets and customers. Digital transformation and data analysis, therefore, play a predominant role in improving operational  efficiency,  price  management,  and the  quality  of  the services provided to the customers.\n\n## 2022 INDUSTRIAL MERCHANT REVENUE BY END-MARKET\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 40% of Gas & Services revenue.\n\n## b. Business model\n\nA large share of Industrial Merchant sales is covered by contracts with terms of up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and up to 15 years for small on-site gas generators. These contracts generally include gas supply, the reliable and safe delivery of products and the provision by the Group of equipment at customers' sites, the provision of a service, as well as the indexation of the sales price to different variables such as inflation and energy prices. The provision of cylinders or tanks at customers' sites is covered by a fixed monthly fee. The wide range of markets, customers, and regions in which the Group is present reinforces the resilience of this business line.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n25%\n\nThe Industrial Merchant (IM) business line is integrated in the industrial basins and  firmly grounded in local economic life. This local base  is strengthened  by  economic  constraints which limit the radius of gas distribution to some 250 kilometers around a production site. One of the strengths of Industrial Merchant is to be able to identify high-potential  areas and establish  a site by developing synergies with  Large  Industries'  network  of  plants  or by investing in dedicated units. While permeating the local economy, the Industrial Merchant business line has expanded its operations internationally in about 60 countries, thus strengthening the business line's resilience. This regional diversity is based on a strategy  of  targeted  investments  and  the regular optimization of portfolios.\n\nA permanent focus on geographic density within the industrial basins  is  a  key success factor  thanks  to  the  synergies  that this generates, in  particular  in terms of logistics. In addition to the business development of a basin, the acquisition of local distributors  and  their  portfolio of  customers  also  helps improve this density, in particular in markets that are still fairly fragmented such as the United States and China.\n\n## c. Supply methods\n\nOn page 29, the diagram shows  the different  supply modes used  in Industrial  Merchant . Strong operational discipline is applied across  the value chain  (supply, packaging,  distribution) and is an essential part of Air Liquide's integrated model. Coupled with new digital tools including the IBO ('Integrated Bulk Operations'), this allows the Group to optimize the use of its resources in real-time (plants, trucks, energy, etc.) to improve the competitiveness  of  its  products and  services for  customers and reduce its CO2 emissions. Air Liquide's quest for continuous improvement helps ensure the safety of its employees, customers,  and  service providers  and  optimize  their  costs  while offering a seamless customer experience.",

Competition\n\nAt a global  level,  the industrial gases  industry  comprises three main players: Air Liquide and Linde Plc (Ireland), co-market leaders with sales in excess of 20 billion euros each,  and  Air Products (United States) with  revenue  which  is more  than two times  lower.  Linde Plc  is  the  new  entity  following  the  merger  of equals between two global players, Linde AG (Germany) and Praxair (United  States), which  was completed  in October  2018. There are also a number of global and regional players, such as Nippon Sanso Holdings (Japan), Air Water (Japan), Messer (Germany),  Hangzhou  Oxygen Plant  Group  'Hangyang'  (China) and  AirPower (China) -formerly Yingde and Baosteel Gases. Finally, numerous smaller-sized players are also present in local markets.\n\nIn Large Industries, the customer can choose between selfproduction and over-the-fence gas supply. Self-production is currently estimated to account  for 90% of hydrogen  production and 60% of oxygen production globally, although with significant geographical disparities. Companies self-producing gas represent an important market share for the Group to address. In this respect, the potential to convert self-production into over-thefence supply represents a major growth opportunity for the Large Industries business. The level of self-production varies  strongly depending on the geographic region, type of industry or local culture.  In  advanced economies, the supply of oxygen is largely over-the-fence, while the supply of hydrogen for refining remains primarily in-house. In developing economies, while relatively new, over-the-fence supply is accelerating significantly. Air Liquide and Linde,  the world  leaders  in  Large Industries,  are  in competition with the other major global players and local players.\n\nIndustrial Merchant is a local  business: transport costs  limit  the operating area to within 200 to 250 km of a production unit, except for high value-added gases such as argon and helium. This market, which is highly diversified due to the size and activity of its customers, thus includes numerous small and medium-sized local competitors, either by producing and distributing gas or solely distributing gas.\n\nIn Healthcare, most gas industry players also  supply hospitals with medical oxygen, but few are present in the treatment of chronic diseases at home. In Home Healthcare,  Air Liquide is number one in Europe, whereas Linde Plc has a larger presence in the United States. This market remains fragmented in almost all regions with a  multitude of small companies and associations. This fragmentation provides bolt-on acquisition opportunities.\n\nIn Electronics, a business in which Air Liquide is the leader, five companies play a major role: Air Liquide, Linde Plc, Merck KGaA (Germany), Air Products and Taiyo Nippon Sanso. In the Advanced Materials market, Air Liquide is a leader and is considered one of the 'first movers' focusing on growing its incumbent position and developing innovative new molecules. The other 'first movers' in this  specific  Electronics market are Merck and Entegris.\n\nIn Engineering & Construction, Air Liquide  also competes with industrial gas players. In 'cryogenic' technologies used for air gas separation, the main competitors are Linde Plc, Hangzhou Oxygen Plant 'Hang yang', AirPower and Air Products. Chinese competitors are gaining  ground due to  strong demand  in their country. In 'non-cryogenic' technologies used for producing hydrogen and the chemical conversion of syngas, the largest competitors are Technip Energies (France), Tecnimont (Italy), Haldor Topsoe (Denmark) and Linde Plc.\n\nGlobal Markets &  Technologies  is growing  worldwide, in  growth markets such as those relating to the energy transition and deep tech.  The competitive  landscape varies greatly from market to market,  with companies  of  various  sizes: from multinationals  to start-ups.\n\nAir Liquide is well positioned to capture new growth opportunities relating to the energy  transition, notably  low carbon hydrogen, thanks to its strategic positioning, operational experience and expertise in  key  technologies  such as  electrolysis, CO2 capture and hydrogen liquefaction.",

DECARBONIZE THE PLANET\n\nWith ADVANCE, Air Liquide confirms its leadership in the decarbonization of the  industry and  in the  emergence  of  a low-carbon society in which hydrogen plays a decisive part.\n\nThe reduction of CO2 emissions is a major challenge for the large players of the industry and for heavy duty mobility. This represents a pool of opportunities for Air Liquide.\n\nmargin by more than 160 basis points (3) over 4 years (2022-2025) excluding  energy passthrough  impact by  acting on several  levers:  a  dynamic  pricing policy,  regular  efficiencies  and an active management of its portfolio of activities.\n\nAt  the same time, investment decisions  will  be increased  to  a record level, to reach about 16 billion euros over the 2022-2025 period, with half of the industrial investments being dedicated to the energy transition (4) . On average, the annual amount of industrial decisions increases by +45% (5) compared to the previous strategic plan, 'NEOS'.\n\nThe Group has a large portfolio of technological solutions and services to accompany its Large Industries customers across the world  in  their  path  to  decarbonization.  Notably, this  includes  the supply of low-carbon industrial gases , the transformation of its customers' industrial processes and CO2 management .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide recognizes the climate emergency and aims to participate  in  the implementation  of  the  Paris Agreement, which defines  a  global framework aimed at limiting global  warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C. As part of its Sustainable Development objectives presented in  March  2021, Air Liquide  is  committed  to achieving carbon neutrality  by  2050. The Group  intends  to  contribute  to carbon neutrality by addressing the entire value chain, therefore covering direct emissions ('Scope 1'), indirect emissions linked to electricity and steam supply ('Scope 2') as well as the main indirect emission categories of 'Scope 3'.\n\nAir Liquide's trajectory towards carbon neutrality in 2050 includes two major intermediate steps in 2025 and 2035:\n\n- \u25a0 to start reducing its absolute CO2 emissions around 2025 ;\n- \u25a0 to reach a -33% decrease of its Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions by 2035 compared to 2020.\n\nThe Group also maintains its objective to reduce by -30% its carbon intensity in kg CO2/\u20ac Ebitda in 2025, compared to 2015, in accordance with a commitment that was made in 2018.\n\nAware  of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its 'Scope 3' emissions reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to pledge to have 75% of its 50 largest customers committed to carbon neutrality by 2025 and 100% by 2035.\n\nFor more information, see pages 353 to 356.",

The CO2 emissions linked to this electricity are accounted for in Scope 2;\n- -62 large hydrogen production units , which consume Natural Gas and emit CO2 accounted for in Scope 1.\n- \u25a0 In the Large Industries business, each air gas or hydrogen production unit is linked to a long-term customer contract , lasting 15 to 20 years . Assets are amortized over the duration of the contract, which limits the risk of impairment.\n- \u25a0 Industrial gases are used in most industries today and will be even more so during the energy transition due to the fact they are at the heart of industry decarbonization solutions . Demand will increasingly turn to low-carbon gases, in line with changing regulations.\n- \u25a0 Solutions have already been implemented to decarbonize existing production units :\n- -for air gases (Scope 2 emissions) mainly by using low-carbon electricity : the deployment of actions in the 10 countries with the greatest potential will  significantly  reduce  Scope  2  emissions.  Since  2018, Air  Liquide  has  already  signed  13 renewable power purchase agreements for about 460 MW. As these assets are more than 95% already electrified, they do not require any specific investment for the transition;\n- -for hydrogen production units or ' SMR ' (Scope 1 emissions), by capturing CO2 . Air Liquide masters a complete portfolio of proprietary technologies for capturing CO2. For example, an advanced Cryocap\u2122 CO2 capture system has been in industrial operation since 2015 on a hydrogen production unit in France. The Group was recently selected for financing via European funds for two carbon capture projects on SMRs. The decarbonization of the Group's 10 largest SMRs will reduce Scope 1 emissions by more than 40% . No dismantling of existing SMRs before the end of the contract is necessary to achieve the Group climate objectives .\n\nThe demand for low-carbon gases at a higher price is  growing  and  allows  to remunerate the necessary investment for the decarbonization of  assets,  in  particular  for  the  production  of  hydrogen,  as  well  as  any  potential  overcosts  linked  to  the  supply  of renewable electricity. In addition, financing programs in the form of subsidies or tax credits are also implemented in Europe and more recently in the United States in order to support, during a transition period, the decarbonization of existing industrial assets and new production units.\n\n- \u25a0 Energy costs (electricity for air gases and natural gas for SMRs) and those related to CO2 emissions (e.g. ETS scheme in Europe) are re-invoiced 100% to the customer in  the  frame  of  a long-term contract. The Group also applies this business model to the supply of low-carbon gas, so Air Liquide does not bear the risk associated with energy and CO2 costs .\n- \u25a0 A client is therefore facing an arbitration between:\n- -bear the cost of CO2 , or\n- -buy low-carbon hydrogen from Air Liquide , the price of which includes the return on investment in a CO2 capture unit as well as operating and storage costs. The higher the price of CO2 , the more the customer will be encouraged to choose the supply of low-carbon hydrogen , which will also contribute to the achievement of its own decarbonization objectives . A high carbon price is therefore favorable to accelerating the decarbonization of the Group assets .  The sensitivity study shows that, depending on the geography and the context, a price starting from 80 to 150 euros per tonne of CO2 encourages the customer to decide toward the supply of  low-carbon hydrogen . This price can be explicit or integrated into regulatory obligations on the carbon footprint of end products.\n- \u25a0 Finally,  any new  investment decision  by Air Liquide now includes the  constraint of reducing  CO2  emissions , in line with the Group's decarbonization objectives . The share of electrolyzers among hydrogen production units should therefore increase in the coming years. Air Liquide recently announced several 200 MW electrolyzer projects and entered into an electrolyzer manufacturing partnership and joint venture with Siemens Energy.\n\nThe potential impacts of  the risk related  to the  energy transition were analyzed as part of the closing of  the Group's financial statements (see note 31 to the Consolidated financial statements - page 309) and no significant impact was identified , mainly for the reasons mentioned above . The energy transition is above all a growth opportunity for Air Liquide , as the Group has the technologies to decarbonize the assets of its industrial customers .",

INVESTMENT PROCESS\n\nThe Group's steady long-term growth is largely due to its ability to invest  in  new  projects  each  year.  Investment  projects  in  the industrial  gas  business  are  spread  throughout  the  world,  highly capital  intensive  and  supported  by  long-term  contracts,  in particular  for  Large  Industries  and  Electronics.  Air  Liquide  has thus tailored  its  financing  to  the  nature  of  its  projects,  based  on the diversification of financing sources, the prudent management of  the  balance  sheet  and  innovative  financing  methods.  This financing  policy  is  fundamental  for  the  Group's  continued development. ONG\n\nThe Group's investments reflect its growth strategy. They can be classified into two categories:\n\n- \u25a0 industrial  investments,  which  bolster  organic  growth  and guarantee the efficiency, replacement, maintenance and safety of installations;\n- \u25a0 financial  investments,  which  strengthen  existing  positions  or accelerate penetration into a new region or business segment through the bolt-on acquisition of companies or assets already in operation, as well as new technologies.\n\nThe  nature  of  industrial  investments  differs  from  one  World Business  Line  to  the  next:  from  gas  production  units  for  Large Industries  and  Electronics,  to  filling  centers,  logistics  equipment, storage facilities,  medical  devices  and  management systems for Industrial  Merchant,  Electronics  and  Healthcare.  The  nature  of investments is also highly varied within Global Markets & Technologies. Capital intensity varies greatly from one business to another.",

Thus, achieving decarbonization objectives necessarily involves aligning investment plans with the decarbonization trajectory. The investment process  is now accompanied by the allocation and monitoring of an  annual 'CO2  budget' allocated to the Group's operations, in order to fine-tune the trajectory.\n\nMoreover, for all its projects, for all geographies, even those without a current price  for CO2, Air Liquide includes a carbon price in its investment decision process . A sensitivity study to this aspect is performed with various values including a reference price of 50 euros per tonne , the local current price and a high value of 100 euros per tonne, or more ,  chosen in function of the geography and context. The study allows to assess the economic cost of greenhouse gas emissions and consequences on the project, even in the case of a strong carbon price increase in the long term. The analysis ensures the robustness and  sustainability of the customer project, the CO2 cost being contractually invoiced to the client. This analysis also makes it possible to validate the relevance and viability  of  the  investment solution planned by Air Liquide and to propose low-carbon technological solutions.\n\n## 3.2.1.  Capital intensity\n\nCapital  intensity  is the  ratio of capital  required  to  generate one euro of supplementary revenue when projects or businesses reach maturity. This capital is either invested in industrial assets (production  units,  storage  facilities, logistics  equipment,  etc.), or used as working capital to finance the development of the activities.\n\nCapital intensity varies significantly from one business to another:\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries:\n- -air gas production  has a capital  intensity of around 3.  It varies with the trend in electricity prices,\n- -hydrogen  production  has  a  capital  intensity  of  between  1 and 2, due to the high proportion of natural gas or electricity (in the case of electrolyzers) in the cost of sales. This capital intensity, therefore, varies with the changes in natural gas and electricity prices;\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant capital intensity to launch the business in a new market is between 1.5 and 2;\n- \u25a0 Electronics has an average capital intensity between 2.5 and 3;\n- \u25a0 in Healthcare, capital intensity, excluding acquisitions, is around 1 depending on the product mix.\n\nThe Group's capital intensity, therefore, continues to vary depending on the  business mix, project type  and prices  of  raw materials. It is much higher for renewal and efficiency investments.\n\nWhatever the capital intensity, any project must enable the Group to achieve its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE) objective over the long term. Therefore, for the same level of return on investment, the operating margin (OIR to revenue ratio) of a project will depend on the capital intensity of the activity in which the project is carried out.\n\n## 3.2.2.  The theoretical lifespan of gas production unit contracts\n\nLong-term development is  one of  the key  characteristics of the Industrial Gas business. It is particularly evident in the investment cycle, where there is approximately a five-year span between the study of a new construction project for a Large Industries customer and the first corresponding industrial gas sales. Investment  cycles in  other business  lines are generally shorter. Monitoring the lifespan of these projects is essential to anticipating the Group's future growth. The chart below provides details of each stage of this process based on the example of a Large Industries contract.\n\n## INVESTMENT CYCLE OF A LARGE INDUSTRIES CONTRACT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5-7 years\n\nApplying a theoretical capital intensity of 2, an investment of 100 million euros in a new project should generate 50 million euros of sales per annum, when fully ramped-up.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Projects  exceeding 5 million euros of investment for Large Industries and exceeding 3 million euros for  other business  lines are monitored within  the portfolio  of potential opportunities and split between those for which a decision is expected within 12 months and those for which the investment decision will take more than one year. Projects are then discussed and negotiated with the customer. Projects can be removed from the portfolio for several reasons:\n- 1. the contract is signed, it is removed from the portfolio and therefore becomes an investment decision;\n- 2. the project is abandoned by the customer;\n- 3. the customer decides against an over-the-fence gas supply or the project is awarded to a competitor;\n- 4. the project  is delayed  beyond 12 months: it is removed from  the 12-month portfolio  but remains  in  the long-term portfolio.\n- \u25a0 Signature  phase: the  two  parties  reach  an  agreement.  The signing of a long-term contract represents an investment decision validated by the internal governance bodies. The project is removed from the portfolio of investment opportunities and is registered in current investments.\n- \u25a0 Construction phase: the construction of the unit generally takes around 24 months and sometimes up to 36 months depending on the size of the project. This is the capital expenditure period. The project remains in current investments.\n\n## \u25a0 Revenue phase:\n\n- 1. commissioning: this corresponds to the start-up of the unit. Sales reflect the needs of the customer with a guaranteed minimum volume at the take-or-pay level, guaranteeing minimum profitability from the beginning of the contract;\n- 2. ramp-up: this is the unit's ramp-up phase. Over the course of  the  contract  term,  volumes increase above the take-orpay  level  to the nominal  amount defined  in  the contract. Nominal capital intensity is achieved only at the end of this phase.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Governance of major growth projects\n\nThree Air Liquide entities are at the heart of major growth projects, from development through to its execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe business line involved ensures the global customer relationship  is monitored, provides the required know-how and ensures the  overall consistency  of  the project, in  terms  of both contract and technical standards. It  is  also  responsible  for  good internal governance practices.\n\nThe local subsidiary proposes the project and, once the contract has been signed, carries the investment on its balance sheet. It is then responsible for operations, customer relations and the project's financial profitability.\n\nEngineering & Construction provides the technologies and guarantees that they are competitive, both overall and specifically for each project thanks to a good industrial architecture solution. Engineering & Construction is responsible for the technical aspect and works with local Capital Implementation teams (CI within the hubs) which are responsible for executing the project. The local CI team is supported  by  a dedicated  CIG (Capital  Implementation Group) composed of experts. In the cases of  the  most  complex projects,  the project execution authority  is  piloted by the  Group Transformational Investments team (GTI).\n\nPotential  projects  are  identified  well in  advance,  based  on  good market knowledge and a strong local presence.  The  first stage includes selecting the opportunities in which the Group would like to invest both commercial and technical resources, in line with its global strategy. This selection process is followed by a series of validation stages.\n\nDuring  the development stage, the  project is  submitted for the approval  of the  geographic region on which  it  depends. At the Group level, three major bodies validate the relevance of the project: the RIC (Resources & Investment Committee - see below page 45) which is responsible for assessing and validating investment requests, the ERC (Engineering Risk Committee) which is responsible for assessing technical and execution risk, as well as the E-Enrisk (Energy and Emissions Risks Committee) in charge of  taking  into  account  aspects  related  to energy and the environment.\n\nOnce the project has been decided on by Air Liquide and signed with the customer, it is executed by a team composed of representatives of the investing subsidiary and Engineering & Construction, under the supervision of the geographic hub.\n\nDuring the start-up of a unit, project management is the responsibility of the local operational teams, under strict standards to ensure the site's security and integrity. The operational management of the unit is carried out by the local subsidiary, and the Group and hub's Operations Control monitors its financial performance.",

FINANCING\n\nThe financing policy is regularly reviewed to provide the best possible support to the Group's development and take into account changes in financial market conditions while respecting a credit profile in line with Standard & Poor's and Moody's long-term minimum 'A' category rating.\n\nThe Air Liquide Group applies the following principles of prudence:\n\n- \u25a0 diversifying financing sources and spreading of debt maturities in order to minimize refinancing risk;\n- \u25a0 backing commercial paper issues with confirmed credit facilities;\n- \u25a0 hedging interest rate risk to ensure visibility of financing costs, in line with long-term investment decisions;\n- \u25a0 funding investments in the currency of the operating cash flows, to ensure a natural currency hedging;\n- \u25a0 a permanent centralization of funding and excess cash through Air Liquide Finance, a wholly-owned entity of L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## 3.3.1.  Diversifying and securing financing sources\n\nAir Liquide diversifies its financing sources by accessing various debt markets: commercial paper, bonds and banks.\n\nFor its short-term financing, Air Liquide uses the short-term commercial paper market, in France,  in  the form of short-term negotiable securities (NeuCP) through two programs of up to an outstanding maximum of 3 billion euros each, and in the United States through a US Commercial Paper program (USCP) of up to an outstanding maximum of 2 billion US dollars.\n\nFor its long-term financing, Air Liquide has a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program to issue long-term bonds of up to an outstanding  maximum  amount  of  12  billion  euros.  This program allows, in particular, for bonds to be issued in the principal currencies  (euro,  US dollar,  Japanese yen) as well as in other currencies  (Chinese  renminbi, Swiss  franc  and  pound sterling). Air Liquide can also issue private placements.\n\nIn line with its environmental and social objectives, Air Liquide has established a Sustainable Financing Framework to cover the following  instruments to  finance  sustainable  projects  intended  to have a clear benefit to the environment and society. This Framework is aligned  with the  Green  Loan Principles  2020 and the Social  Loan Principles  2021 overseen by the Loan Market Association (LMA) and with the Green Bond Principles 2018 (GBP), the Social Bond Principles 2020 (SBP) and the Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018 (SBG) overseen by the International Capital Markets Association (ICMA).\n\nThe Group also raises funds through bank debt (loans and credit facilities).\n\nTo avoid liquidity risk relating to the renewal of funding at maturity, and in accordance with the Group's internal policy, the Group limits its short-term debt maturities to an amount that is covered from its core banks by committed  credit facilities,  syndicated or bilateral.\n\nInvestments  are generally funded in the currency in which the cash flows are generated, creating a natural currency hedge.\n\n## 3.3.2.  Centralization of cash and funding, excess cash and hedging\n\nTo benefit from economies of scale and facilitate capital markets financing (bonds and commercial paper), the Group uses a dedicated subsidiary, Air Liquide Finance. This subsidiary centralizes the vast majority of the Group's financing transactions. It  hedges currency, interest rate and energy risk for the Group's subsidiaries in those countries where it is permitted by law.\n\nIn the countries where local regulations allow it, Air Liquide Finance also centralizes cash flow balances through direct or indirect daily cash pooling of these outstanding balances or through intra-group loans and borrowings. When daily international cash concentration is not possible, there exist, nonetheless, local cash poolings which allow periodic intercompany loans to Air Liquide Finance.\n\nDue to the currency matching within Air Liquide Finance, resulting from the  currency  hedging of intra-group loans  and  borrowings, these internal financing transactions  do not generate a foreign exchange risk for the Group.\n\nAir Liquide Finance, which centralizes the Group's financial hedging transactions, complies with EMIR requirements (European Market Infrastructure Regulation) relating to its status as  a  non-financial  counterparty  (NFC-).  Following the  definitions brought  by  EMIR  REFIT  and  according to its  status  'NFC-', Air Liquide Finance transferred from 2021 the responsibility for reporting derivatives to its counterparties.\n\nFurthermore, in certain specific cases (e.g. regulatory constraints, high country risk, joint ventures, etc.), the Group may limit its risk through adapted management, by setting up specific financing in the local banking market, and by using credit risk insurance.\n\n## 3.3.3.  Staggering debt maturity\n\nTo minimize the refinancing risk related to debt maturity schedules, the Group spreads maturities over several years.\n\nDebt maturity schedules are regularly reviewed by Finance Department and Executive Management during Finance Committee.\n\nRefinancing risk is also reduced by the regularity of the cash flow generated from Group activities.\n\n## 3.3.4.  Use of bank guarantees\n\nGroup subsidiaries require  from time to time bank guarantees, mostly in favor of Healthcare, Engineering & Construction and Global Markets  & Technologies,  either  during the  tender  period (bid bond), or after contract award, during contract execution until the end of the warranty period (advance payment bond, retention bond, performance bond, and warranty bond).\n\nThe most common bank guarantees are advance payment bonds and performance bonds and are extended to customers to secure contractual performance.\n\nIn the  Group's ordinary  course  of  business, certain subsidiaries are  required to provide financial  payment guarantees  to  secure rental or insurance obligations.\n\nThe projects, for which these guarantees are granted, are regularly reviewed by management and are subject to approval by the Board of Directors for guarantees which exceed 100 million euros. When guarantee payment calls become probable, the necessary provisions are recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The  Group benefited  from  a solid business model and diversity of business reach in terms of geographies, businesses, end-markets and customers which ensured a resilient performance and allowed the Group to take advantage of all growth opportunities .  The ADVANCE strategic plan reinforces these attributes which position the Group in growth markets of the future (in particular the energy transition, Semiconductors and Healthcare).\n\nConsolidated sales of the Engineering & Construction business grew by +20.6% ,  reflecting the increase in order intake in recent quarters. Global Markets & Technologies continued  its  growth momentum with sales up by +25.8% in 2022, driven in particular by the Biogas business development.\n\nThe Group's revenue as published posted a significant increase of +28.3% in 2022, with a record high energy impact of +15.3% as well as a favorable currency impact of +5.8%, while the significant scope impact was limited (+0.2%).\n\n## Gas & Services\n\nGas & Services revenue in 2022 totaled 28,573 million euros , a strong increase of +6.1% .  The two growth drivers for 2022 were the Industrial Merchant business, with sales up +14.2% , supported by a record price effect and resilient volumes, and the Electronics business,  with  revenue up +16.4% .  Despite  a  high basis of comparison in 2021 linked to covid-19, sales in Healthcare increased by +3.6% , supported by the strong development of Home Healthcare, particularly in Europe, and proximity  care  in  the United  States.  Sales in Large  Industries were  down -6.6% ,  marked by  mixed activity depending on the geography: in Europe, the decline in volumes was part of a context of an exceptionally strong increase in energy prices, while sales increased in America and remained stable in Asia. Sales in Gas & Services in 2022 rose sharply by +28.3% as published: the energy impact (+16.1%) reached a record level over the year, with a peak in the 3 rd quarter, the currency impact (+5.8%) also made a positive contribution, while the significant scope effect (+0.3%) remained limited. The latter corresponds to the additional contribution in 2022 of the 16 Sasol units acquired in June 2021, less  the  effect of  the  deconsolidation  of  the activities  in Russia from September 1, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Large Industries business (+3.7%) benefited from the start-up of several production units and solid demand. In the Industrial Merchant business,  sales  increased by +13.5%, supported  by  the strong increase in prices. Despite a high basis of comparison due to the covid-19  pandemic in 2021, Healthcare revenue was  up  +3.9% thanks to the development of the proximity care business in  the United States and the Home Healthcare business in Latin America. Finally, Electronics posted sales up +5.8% over the year, driven by strong growth in Carrier Gases and Specialty Materials.\n\n## AMERICAS GAS & SERVICES 2022 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 Large Industries revenue  in  2022  was up +3.7% .  Air gases volumes were up sharply until the end of the 3 rd quarter, supported by solid demand from Chemicals customers and the contribution of new production units. The 4 th quarter was\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AMERICAS\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced a long term agreement to supply ultra high purity hydrogen, helium, and carbon dioxide to one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers. The Group plans to invest nearly 50 million euros to build, own and operate onsite plants and systems at a new manufacturing site in Phoenix, Arizona .\n\n## Europe\n\nRevenue in Europe was up +2.0% in 2022 and totaled 11,390 million euros . Sales evolution was contrasted depending on business lines. In a context of very high energy prices, Large Industries sales were down by -16.6% over the year, strongly impacted by volumes down -8% and a combined effect (1) in  the 3 rd quarter. The Industrial Merchant business line saw an\n\nexceptionally high level of sales growth of +24.1%, benefiting from a  record  price effect  of  +23.6%. Healthcare  revenue  posted  an increase of +4.4%, supported by the dynamism of Home Healthcare and despite a high  basis  of comparison due to the covid-19 pandemic in 2021.\n\nmarked by weaker demand in Chemicals, particularly from ethylene oxide producers, and in the Steel industry. Hydrogen sales also increased in 2022, supported by the ramp-up of new units in Latin America offsetting several customer maintenance turnarounds.\n\n- \u25a0 In Industrial Merchant , the significant increase in sales of +13.5% in  2022 was supported by a very strong price effect of +13.4% ,  offsetting the  increase  in  costs in an inflationary context. Volumes were stable  across  the year  and up +1% excluding  helium, in  particular  for  bulk  and hardgoods,  while the volume growth of cylinder gas was more moderate. Sales grew across all sectors in 2022, particularly in the Automotive, Fabrication, Materials and Energy sectors.\n- \u25a0 Healthcare revenue  was up +3.9% in  2022,  despite a  sharp decline in volumes of medical oxygen for treating covid-19 compared to 2021. Sales of medical gases rose in the United States as a result of dynamic activity and higher prices in proximity care. In Latin America, Home Healthcare sales were up sharply over the year and medical gases contributed to growth in the 2nd half-year.\n- \u25a0 The Electronics business posted a revenue increase of +5.8% over the year. The strong growth in Carrier Gases was supported by the ramp-up of several production units and high helium prices. Specialty Materials sales were considerably higher, benefiting notably from the increase in the price of rare gases. Lastly, high sales in Equipment & Installation contributed to the development of the business in the United States.",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 In a context of conflict in Ukraine and exceptionally high energy prices, peaking in the 3 rd quarter, sales in Large Industries decreased by -16.6% in 2022. The beginning of the slowdown seen  toward  the  end of the  1 st quarter, notably  in Steel,  was  confirmed  from the  2 nd quarter  across  all  sectors. As a result, volumes were down -8% over the year and -16% in the 4 th quarter, due to the slowdown in demand from customers in the Steel and Chemicals sectors, particularly in Germany and Benelux. Moreover, certain refineries used lighter crude  oils, which need  less hydrogen. Finally, in the 3 rd quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the 4 th quarter, the comparable growth was also heavily impacted by an unfavorable combined effect (2) linked to very high energy prices.\n\n## EUROPE GAS & SERVICES 2022 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EUROPE\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and TotalEnergies are innovating, in the context of the conversion to a biorefinery of the TotalEnergies' Grandpuits site, to produce and valorize renewable and low-carbon hydrogen . Air Liquide will invest over 130 million euros in the construction and operation of a new unit producing hydrogen. This unit will partly use biogas from the biorefinery built by TotalEnergies, and will be equipped from the beginning with Air Liquide's carbon capture technology, Cryocap TM . These innovations will avoid emissions amounting to 150,000 tonnes of CO2 a year compared to current processes. TotalEnergies' biorefinery will use the unit's hydrogen to produce sustainable aviation fuel .  Moreover, Air Liquide will commercialize part of the hydrogen for the mobility and the captured CO2 for the needs of Industrial Merchant customers.\n- \u25a0 In Europe, several  projects  have  obtained financing from European funds or  recognition  as an Important  Hydrogen Project  of Common European Interest (IPCEI) making it possible to obtain national subsidies:\n- -Air Liquide and Lhoist have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the aim to decarbonize Lhoist's lime production plant located in the North of France, using Air Liquide's innovative and proprietary Cryocap TM carbon capture technology.\n- -The European Commission announced it will grant Air Liquide, Fluxys Belgium and Port of Antwerp-Bruges 144.6 million euros subsidies .  The funding is earmarked for the construction of shared CO2 transport and export facilities on the Antwerp port platform. The grant award is a major step towards the final investment decision, expected in 2023.\n- -Air  Liquide  welcomed  the Dutch State decision  to  support  its large-scale  renewable hydrogen projects, named ELYgator and CurtHyl . These electrolyzer projects, which will have a capacity of 200 MW each , will significantly contribute to the decarbonization of  the Dutch and Belgian industries and support the growth of clean mobility markets. The ELYgator project has also been selected to receive fundings from the European Innovation Fund .\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has signed several long term renewable power purchase agreement (PPA) in Europe:\n- -a new contract with Vattenfall in the Netherlands for a 115 MW of new offshore wind power under construction;\n- -a first contract with Shell Energy Europe Limited (SEEL) to power industrial and medical gas production in the North East of Italy with an installed 42 MW solar energy capacity.\n- \u25a0 Air  Liquide confirmed its intention to withdraw from Russia .  Taking  a  responsible and orderly approach, the Group has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the local management team with the objective to transfer its activities in Russia in the framework of an MBO (Management Buy Out). This project is notably subject to Russian regulatory approvals. In parallel, as a consequence of the evolution of the geopolitical context, the activities of the Group in Russia were no longer consolidated from September 1, 2022 .\n\n## INTEGRATED REPORT\n\n## Performance\n\n- \u25a0 The Industrial  Merchant business line  saw an exceptionally high level of  sales growth of +24.1% in 2022,  driven by a record price effect of +23.6% . Amid an inflationary environment, contractual indexation and proactive price rise campaigns clearly proved their effectiveness. In the 4 th quarter, the price effect remained strong despite the high basis of comparison, as prices  had begun to increase significantly in the 4 th quarter of 2021. Volumes remained very resilient, slightly up in 2022, despite a shortage of liquefied CO2 which worsened in the 4 th quarter. Sales increased across all sectors, particularly Food, Fabrication and Materials.\n- \u25a0 Sales in Healthcare posted solid growth of +4.4% ,  despite a high  basis of  comparison  in  2021,  particularly  in  the  1 st halfyear, due to the covid-19 pandemic. They benefited in particular from a dynamic Home Healthcare business, in particular for the treatment of diabetes, and from the contribution of  an acquisition  in Poland in the  4 th quarter of 2021. In Medical Gases, the unfavorable basis of comparison resulting from the high oxygen consumption during the covid-19 pandemic in 2021 was reduced  in the  2 nd half-year and the price increases that were gradually achieved over the year partially offset inflation-related rises in costs. Specialty Ingredients sales saw a pronounced increase, driven by higher volumes and price increases to offset higher costs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It benefited from particularly dynamic  growth  in  the Electronics business  (+17.8%).  Sales in Large Industries were stable (+0.3%), with the covid-19 pandemic disrupting business growth in China, while sales in the rest of Asia remained  low throughout  the year.  In  Industrial  Merchant,  sales benefited from a sharp rise in prices and increased by +4.2%.\n\n## ASIA-PACIFIC GAS & SERVICES 2022 REVENUE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ASIA-PACIFIC\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced significant investments in Asia for the Electronics business:\n- -the construction  in Taiwan of three production  units for  two of  the world's  largest  semiconductor manufacturers  for a total investment amount of approximately 500 million euros .\n- -long-term contracts for the supply of nitrogen and other very high purity gases in Japan with two world leaders in semiconductors. This is  a staggered investment of more than 300 million euros in four production units located  in  key  Electronics  industrial basins.\n- \u25a0 Shanghai Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases Co. Ltd (SCIPIG) , a subsidiary of Air Liquide, will invest more than 200 million euros to build two hydrogen production units and related infrastructure in Shanghai Chemical Industry Park (SCIP). These units will bring significant environmental benefits, as they are designed to replace current supply from a third party coal-based gasification unit, will be equipped with CO2 capture and recycling technology and will be connected to SCIPIG existing local network. These two units will come in addition to two other hydrogen units and four air separation units that SCIPIG already operates in the industrial park.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide  Korea  and Lotte  Chemical entered  a joint  venture to scale-up  the hydrogen supply chain for mobility markets  in South Korea . The companies will co-invest through the joint venture in a new generation of large scale hydrogen filling centers in Daesan and Ulsan.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has signed a long-term contract to supply Kumho Mitsui Chemical (KMCI), a world leader in the chemical industry, with additional hydrogen and carbon monoxide in South Korea 's Yeosu National Industrial Complex, where Air Liquide already operates four production units.\n- \u25a0 Large Industries revenue was stable ( +0.3% ) in 2022. In China, growth slowed in the 1 st half-year,  in  particular  due  to residual energy  control  measures during the  1 st quarter, and covid-19-related lockdowns during the 2nd quarter. Sales grew strongly in  the 3 rd quarter and,  to a lesser extent,  in the  4 th quarter,  disrupted  by  the  covid-19  pandemic in December. In the rest of Asia, sales were weak in 2022, and more markedly in Singapore, particularly in the 4 th quarter.\n- \u25a0 Industrial Merchant revenue was up +4.2% in 2022. The price effect stood at a very high level of +6.8% over the year. In China, solid sales growth benefited from the increase in prices and the integration of small acquisitions, but was affected  by  the  covid-19  pandemic  in the  2nd  quarter  and  at year-end. The  situation  was contrasted  in  the  rest of Asia in 2022, with  business  down in Japan but  up in  Singapore and Australia. In the region, revenue growth was particularly marked in the Food, Energy and Technology sectors.\n- \u25a0 2022 revenue from Electronics posted very strong growth of +17.8% ,  supported  by  all  business  segments.  Carrier  Gases benefited from several unit start-ups in China during the year and the ramp-up of several units in the region. Sales in Specialty Materials also grew strongly, partly due to the increase in  the price  of  rare  gases.  The Advanced  Materials business  was dynamic, particularly  in  Singapore  and  China. Lastly, Equipment & Installation sales in 2022 were very high.",

        "page_content": "## Middle East and Africa\n\nRevenue for 2022 in  the  Middle  East  and Africa  region was  up +0.8% to 895 million  euros .  The sales  growth in  air gases  in India and Egypt explained the strong performance of Large Industries.  Volumes also increased  sharply in South Africa with the integration of the 16 Sasol Air Separation Units , whose acquisition was finalized at the end of the 1 st half of 2021; sales of 126 million euros over the year were accounted for in the significant scope impact and hence excluded from comparable growth. In Industrial  Merchant, sales  were down  over  the year,\n\nwith the +6.4% increase in prices not fully offsetting the divestiture of  small  businesses  in the  Middle  East;  in the  4 th quarter,  sales growth excluding the impact of divestitures was above +10%. Sales in the Healthcare business were down compared  to the high level in 2021 as a result of the covid-19 pandemic. However, activity returned to growth in the 4 th quarter due to a more favorable basis of comparison, dynamic activity in Home Healthcare and an acquisition in South Africa.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and EZZ Steel , one of the leading steel producers in the Middle East and Africa, have signed a long term agreement for the supply of industrial gases to EZZ's new plant in Ain Sokhna, East of Cairo, Egypt . Air Liquide Egypt will invest around 80 million US dollars in building an Air Separation Unit (ASU) to supply EZZ needs throughout the duration of the contract, as well as those of other customers in the basin.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide  announced  the divestiture of  its Industrial  Merchant businesses  in  the United  Arab  Emirates , Bahrain and Saudi Arabia . In the  region,  the  Group remains well  positioned to  strengthen its  already  strong presence in Large Industries and Healthcare , and to seize the many opportunities in the fields of energy transition and the development of low-carbon hydrogen.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and Sasol have signed two Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) with Enel Green Power for the long-term supply of a total  capacity  of 220 MW of renewable power to  Sasol's  Secunda  site,  in South Africa ,  where Air  Liquide operates the biggest oxygen production site in the world. These PPAs are the first results of the Request for Proposal (RFP) process launched jointly by Air Liquide and Sasol in April, 2021, targeting to secure a total renewable energy capacity of 900 MW . They will significantly contribute to the decarbonization of the Secunda site, and in particular to the targeted reduction  by  30% to  40% of  the CO2  emissions associated with the oxygen production by 2031. The 220 MW wind power should be available in 2025.\n\n## Engineering & Construction\n\nConsolidated revenue from Engineering & Construction totaled 474 million euros in 2022 , up strongly by +20.6% .\n\nOrder intake (1,041 million euros) for Group projects and third-party customers exceeded 1 billion euros for the second consecutive year . For the Group, this includes a large Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) and several large Air Separation Units (ASU) for Electronics and Large Industries. Sales to third-party customers include a major helium liquefaction unit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide and Siemens Energy announced the creation of a joint venture dedicated to the series production of industrial scale renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in Europe . With two of the global leading companies in their field combining their expertise ,  this  Franco-German partnership will enable the emergence of a sustainable hydrogen economy in Europe and foster a European ecosystem for electrolysis and hydrogen technology. Production is expected to begin in the second half of 2023 and ramp-up to an annual production capacity of 3 GW by 2025 .\n- \u25a0 Autothermal reforming ( ATR ) is one of the latest technologies used for decarbonization of industries : combined with carbon capture technology, it allows efficient, large-scale production of low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia . Among the leading companies on the ATR, Air Liquide technology has been selected for a demonstration project ,  owned and operated by INPEX CORPORATION, aimed at producing low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia.\n\n## Global Markets & Technologies\n\nGlobal Markets & Technologies revenue for 2022 reached 887 million euros , representing a very high growth of +25.8% compared to 2021. Biogas maintained strong momentum and benefited from sales price increase linked to the spike in energy price. Higher sales of Turbo-Brayton LNG reliquefaction units contributed to the growth. The 4 th quarter was  also marked  by sales of equipment for the space industry and special equipment for cooling helium.\n\nOrder intake for Group projects and third-party customers totaled 875 million euros , representing a dynamic increase of +25% compared to  2021.  These include  more than 50  Turbo-Brayton LNG reliquefaction units to be delivered over the next two to three years,  a large helium  liquefaction  unit and numerous pieces  of equipment for the Electronics, Hydrogen and Biogas markets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Located in Huai'an City, in the Jiangsu Province, the unit will have a production capacity of 75 GWh per year . This project demonstrates a circular economy and low-carbon approach .\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide has opened  its largest liquid  hydrogen  production  and logistics  center in  the north  of  Las  Vegas, Nevada .  This infrastructure aims to meet the growing needs for hydrogen dedicated to mobility and to ensure the supply of a large number of industries.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide announced several agreements regarding the development of the hydrogen ecosystem:\n- -with CaetanoBus and Toyota Motor Europe to propose integrated offers for hydrogen mobility including the development of infrastructures and fleets of light and heavy vehicles ;\n- -with Groupe ADP with the ambition of creating the first engineering joint venture specialized in hydrogen integration projects within airport infrastructures.\n\n## OPERATING INCOME RECURRING\n\nOperating income recurring before depreciation and amortization totaled 7,328 million euros ,  a  sharp increase of +15.7% as  published  and +9.4% excluding  the  currency impact compared with 2021.\n\nPurchases were up markedly by +41.0%  excluding currency impact , mainly due to the exceptionally strong and rapid increase in energy costs (+65% excluding the currency impact), which are contractually passed through to Large Industries customers. In a context of high inflation, personnel costs were up +7.7% excluding the currency impact . Other operating income and expenses increased by +14.7% excluding the currency impact and  notably  included a  marked increase  in  transport and, to  a lesser extent, maintenance costs.\n\nDepreciation and amortization amounted to 2,466 million euros ,  an increase of +6.9%  excluding  the currency  impact. This increase is mainly related to the start-up of new production units, the integration  of Sasol's 16  Air Separation Units  (ASU) acquired in June 2021 and Air  Liquide  taking control of  a  joint venture in Asia-Pacific. It was very partially offset by the deconsolidation of businesses in Russia.\n\nThe Group's operating income recurring (OIR) reached 4,862 million euros .  It  was  up  sharply  by +16.9% as  published and +10.5% on a comparable basis, which is significantly higher than comparable sales growth of +7.0%. The operating margin (OIR to revenue ratio) stood at 16.2% as published, representing a -160 basis point decline compared with 2021, due to the sharp increase in energy costs which are contractually passed through to  Large  Industries  customers. This therefore  has  a  mechanical dilutive  impact on the  published  margin. Excluding the  energy impact, the operating margin improved very significantly by +70 basis points . This performance integrates the dilutive impact of  strong  inflation of  costs  other  than energy costs, in  Industrial Merchant  in  particular,  and  which  is transferred to  sales prices. This +70 basis point improvement therefore particularly reflected the Group's ability to rapidly transfer the exceptionally strong and brutal  increase  in  energy  costs and  inflation  in  general  to  sales prices.\n\nThis improvement  in  the  operating margin  is  also  supported  by efficiencies (3) which  amounted to 378 million euros over the year. These  efficiencies  represent  a  saving  of 2.2% of  the  cost base.  In  a  context  of  high  inflation  unfavorable  to procurement efficiencies, the priority for the teams is to limit cost increases and transfer them to sales prices. Industrial efficiencies contributed more than 50% of total efficiencies and included energy efficiency\n\n(3)\n\nand production optimization projects in Large Industries and supply chain improvements in  Industrial  Merchant. The Group's digital transformation continued: in Large Industries with the connection of new units to remote operation centers (Smart Innovative Operations, SIO), in Industrial Merchant with the acceleration of the tools implementation to optimize delivery routes (Integrated Bulk  Operations, IBO) and in Healthcare with the deployment of remote patient support platforms. The continued implementation of shared service centers and the global continuous improvement program also contributed to efficiencies.\n\nPortfolio and pricing management also supported margin improvement.\n\nGas & Services\n\n## GAS & SERVICES 2022 OPERATING INCOME RECURRING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Gas & Services businesses operating income recurring totaled 5,062 million euros , representing a sharp increase of +16.0% compared  with  2021  and of +10.2%  on  a comparable basis . The operating margin stood at 17.7% as published, up +70 basis points excluding the energy impact . The operating margin, as published, was down compared with 2021 due to the very strong increase in energy costs, which are contractually passed through to customers and thus have a dilutive impact.\n\nPrices in the Industrial Merchant business experienced a record increase of +14.7% in 2022, with a peak at +18.0% in the 3 rd quarter,  demonstrating  the Group's ability  to rapidly  transfer the rise in costs. Prices were also up in Large Industries, Electronics and Healthcare, across all regions.",

Excluding the energy impact , the operating margin increased by +10 basis points compared with 2021. In Large Industries, solid efficiencies and spot sales of electricity produced by cogeneration units participated in the margin improvement. Efficiencies in Industrial Merchant, combined with strong cost control, also made a positive contribution.\n\nOperating income recurring for Europe totaled 1,577 million euros , an increase of +9.2% as published. Excluding the energy impact , the operating margin saw a sharp increase of +140 basis points compared with 2021. In Large Industries, the structure of contracts ensured the resilience of the operating margin in a context of declining volumes; solid efficiencies also contributed to margin improvements, as  well as  cogeneration  unit  activity and the combined effect (4) in an environment of sharply rising energy prices. In Industrial Merchant, the increase in prices and efficiencies  contributed to the  increase  of  the operating margin, while in Healthcare, the increase in costs was not fully offset by price effects.\n\nOperating income recurring in Asia-Pacific stood at 1,190 million euros , an increase as published of +11.6% . The operating margin excluding the energy  impact remained stable compared with 2021.\n\nOperating income recurring for the Middle East and Africa reached 211 million euros , an increase of +33.3% as published. Excluding the energy impact ,  the operating margin saw a very strong increase of +200 basis points compared with 2021. The integration of the 16 Sasol units, carried out without re-invoicing energy costs to the customer until the end of the 3rd quarter, is the main contributor to this increase. The divestments in Industrial Merchant in the Middle East and the efficiencies generated in all business lines also had an accretive impact on the operating margin.\n\n## Engineering & Construction\n\nOperating income recurring for Engineering & Construction was 44 million euros in  2022.  The  operating margin stood at 9.3% , compared to 11.0% in 2021, and remains in line with the business unit's medium-term objectives.\n\n## Global Markets & Technologies\n\nOperating income recurring from the Global Markets & Technologies business stood at 112 million euros with an operating margin of 12.6% .\n\n## Corporate Costs and Research & Development\n\nCorporate and  Research &  Development  expenses stood at 356 million euros , up +4.4% compared with 2021.\n\n## NET PROFIT\n\nOther operating income and expenses showed a net balance of -571 million euros .\n\nOther operating  expenses amounted  to -833 million  euros and included  an  exceptional  provision  of  -586  million euros, with  no impact on cash (5) , which covers the impairment of all of the Group's assets in Russia. As a reminder, the Group signed a letter of intent with the local executive management team in September 2022, to transfer (6) its businesses  in  Russia in the  form of an MBO (Management Buy Out).  In  addition, due  to the  changing geopolitical context, the Group's businesses in Russia are no longer consolidated from September 1, 2022. Other operating expenses also included, for -48 million euros, a provision for risks in the Engineering & Construction business, as well as restructuring costs.\n\nOther operating income stood at 262 million euros and corresponded mainly to Air Liquide taking control of a joint venture in Asia during the 1st half-year, revalued at fair value.\n\nFinancial income and expenses amounted to -386 million euros ,  compared with -408 million euros in 2021. They included net finance costs of -288 million euros , a very slight increase of +0.5% excluding  the currency  impact.  The  average  net finance cost, at 3.0%, was up slightly from 2.8% in 2021, mainly due to the increase in  factoring costs,  which are directly related  to  the rise in interest rates. Other financial income and expenses stood  at -98  million  euros compared with -128 million  euros in 2021. This difference  stems  from  a  provision  reversal  related  to interest on arrears.\n\nThe income tax expense totaled -1,002 million euros in  2022, i.e. an effective tax rate of 25.7% , up slightly from 25.4% in 2021, mainly due to significant non-taxable non-recurring items (7) .\n\nThe share of profit of associates amounted to 1 million euros . The share of minority interests in  net profit totaled 145 million euros , up +21.2%, mainly due to  Air Liquide taking control in January 2022 of a joint venture in Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The average number of  outstanding shares used for  the calculation of 2022 net earnings per share was 522,069,020 .\n\n## CHANGE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES\n\n|                                       | FY 2021          | FY 2022     |\n|---------------------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n| Average number  of outstanding shares | 520,828,581  (a) | 522,069,020 |\n\n- (a) Adjusted following the free share attribution in June 2022.\n\n## 3. 2022 Cash Flow and Balance Sheet\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                                                                  | 2021     | 2022     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital                                               | 5,292    | 6,255    |\n| Changes in working capital                                                                                              | 377      | (397)    |\n| Other cash items                                                                                                        | (99)     | (48)     |\n| Net cash flows from operating activities                                                                                | 5,571    | 5,810    |\n| Dividends                                                                                                               | (1,418)  | (1,487)  |\n| Purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of disposals  (a)                                  | (3,388)  | (3,246)  |\n| Proceeds from issues of share capital                                                                                   | 175      | 38       |\n| Purchase of treasury shares                                                                                             | (40)     | (192)    |\n| Lease liabilities repayments and net interests paid on lease liabilities                                                | (274)    | (283)    |\n| Impact of exchange rate changes and net indebtedness of newly consolidated companies & restatement of net finance costs | (465)    | (453)    |\n| Change in net debt                                                                                                      | 161      | 187      |\n| Net debt as of December 31                                                                                              | (10,448) | (10,261) |\n| DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO AS OF DECEMBER 31                                                                                  | 47.5%    | 41.8%    |\n\n## NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENT\n\nCash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital amounted to 6,255 million euros ,  a  marked increase of +18.2% and of +12.0% excluding the currency impact. The cash flow over sales ratio reached a high level of 20.9%, an improvement of +110 basis points compared with 2021, excluding the energy impact .\n\nWorking Capital Requirement  (WCR) rose by 397 million euros compared with 2021. This was mainly  due to the increase in inventories, which reflects inflation and the anticipation of supply difficulties for certain products. Thus, WCR excluding tax to revenue ratio stood at 1.6% , a slight increase compared to an exceptionally low level of 0.9% in 2021 (and 2.3% in 2020).\n\nNet cash flow from operating activities after changes in working capital requirement amounted to 5,810 million euros , an increase of +4.3% compared with 2021.\n\n## DIVIDEND\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting on May 3, 2023, the payment of a dividend of 2.95 euros per share will be proposed to shareholders for  the fiscal year 2022. Following the free share attribution  of 1 for 10  in  June 2022, the  proposed dividend shows a strong growth of +12.2% compared with the previous year. The total estimated pay-out taking into account stock-options, share buybacks and cancellations would amount to 1,587 million euros , representing a pay-out ratio of 58% of the published net profit. The ex-dividend date is scheduled for May 15, 2023 and the payment is scheduled for May 17, 2023.",

They mainly included the acquisition of small entities in the Industrial Merchant and Healthcare business lines, as  well  as  an  additional  participation in a joint  Large Industries business in  Asia,  resulting  in  Air  Liquide  taking its control.  This compares with 660 million euros in 2021, including the acquisition of 16 Air Separation Units from Sasol in South Africa for approximately 480 million euros.\n\nProceeds from the sale of assets ,  which  reached 153 million euros in 2022, underline the Group's efforts to maintain an active portfolio management strategy. They include the disposal of Industrial Merchant businesses in Latin America and in the Global Markets and Technology business line in Europe.\n\nNet capital expenditure (1) totaled 3,246 million euros .\n\n## NET DEBT\n\nNet debt at December 31, 2022, amounted to 10,261 million euros , a decrease of 187 million euros compared with December 31, 2021. The increase in the Group's cash flows from operating activities before changes in working capital makes it  possible to  reduce net debt after the payment  of more than 3.2 billion euros in investments and nearly  1.5 billion euros in dividends. The net debt-to-equity ratio stood at 41.8%.\n\n## ROCE\n\nThe return on  capital employed  after tax (ROCE)  was 9.1% in 2022.

Thus, a new unit in France will in particular supply hydrogen to a biorefinery producing renewable fuels for aviation, hydrogen for mobility and biogenic CO2 for the Industrial Merchant business line (by recovering the residual biogas from the biorefinery and using the  Cryocap TM CO2  capture  process).  Decisions  also  include initial  investments  to  improve the  efficiency  of  the  production units acquired in South Africa in 2021, the installation of a CO2 recycling  system  on  an  existing  carbon  monoxide  production unit in Europe, as well as the electrification of several Air Separation Units in China (impact on Group's CO2 emissions by approximately -1%).\n- \u25a0 Development was robust in the Electronics business, notably in Asia with projects for new production units for carrier gases and advanced materials. Investment decisions also include production units in the United States and Europe.\n- \u25a0 In Industrial Merchant , investment decisions in 2022 included more than 50 small gas generators on customer sites, including several for use in conversion to oxy-combustion furnaces  for the  glass or  aluminum industries, thus reducing natural gas consumption by customers and consequently their CO2 emissions.\n- \u25a0 Investments in the Healthcare business concerned in particular a new specialty ingredients production unit in France.\n- \u25a0 Several investment projects were approved in 2022 in the Global Markets & Technologies business, notably for the production of biogas in Italy and the United States. Furthermore, a new krypton and xenon purification unit will be built in Korea.\n\nFinancial investment  decisions reached 112 million euros in 2022,  compared with  662  million  euros  in  2021,  which included the acquisition of the units from Sasol for approximately 480 million euros. In Industrial Merchant ,  they included several small acquisitions in the United States, China and the Netherlands, and in Healthcare , the acquisition of a South African company specializing in the treatment of diabetes.\n\nThe investment backlog hit  a  record  high  of 3.5 billion euros . Projects in Asia represented a little more than half of investments, primarily in the Electronics business, with several projects in Large Industries. The Europe and America regions have similar levels of ongoing investment: in Europe, these are mainly projects related to the energy transition and in America, mostly projects for Large Industries and Electronics. These projects should lead to a future  contribution to annual sales  of approximately 1.3 billion euros per year when fully ramped up, an increase from 1.1 billion euros at the end of 2021.\n\n## INVESTMENTS\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide signed a record number of 52 new long-term on-site contracts for its Industrial Merchant business line in 2022. On-site production solutions represent a competitive , reliable , environmentally friendly solution and contributes to the resilience of  the Industrial  Merchant activity. These units will serve the Group's customers in nitrogen, oxygen or hydrogen especially in the glass, metals,  water  and waste  treatment  as well as secondary  electronics growing markets.  In  2022,  the Group also launched a new generation of on-site oxygen production units ,  already being installed to convert industrial furnaces to oxy-combustion, saving 10% of energy compared to previous generation.\n\n## Start-ups\n\nThe main start-ups in 2022 concerned the Large Industries and Electronics businesses. In Large Industries , several highcapacity Air Separation Units started up along the Gulf Coast in the United States  and  in  China.  In  Electronics,  start-ups  mainly involved several  carrier  gas  and advanced  materials  production units in Asia, in particular a large  ASU and an electrolyzer in Taiwan in the 4 th quarter. In the Global Markets & Technologies business, they also included several biogas production units and a major hydrogen production and liquefaction unit for the hydrogen mobility market in California.\n\nThe additional contribution to sales of unit start-ups and rampups totaled 421 million  euros in 2022,  including a 128 million euro contribution by the Sasol units in South Africa, with 126  million  euros being accounted for in  the significant scope. Electronics  is  the main  contributor  in Asia,  while  in  Europe and Americas it is Large Industries.\n\nThe additional contribution to 2023 sales of unit start-ups and ramp-ups should be between 300 million and 330 million euros , which is higher than the corresponding amount in 2022, excluding the contribution from the Sasol units.\n\n## Investment opportunities\n\nThe 12-month  portfolio of investment opportunities remains high at 3.3 billion euros at  the  end  of  2022,  up  from 3.0 billion euros in the  3 rd quarter  of  2022. The  projects  related  to energy transition represent more than 40% of the investment opportunities . In Europe, these mainly included projects for renewable hydrogen production by water electrolysis, capture of CO2 emitted by the Group's or its customers' production units, as well as hydrogen mobility development. Investment opportunities in Asia concerned Large Industries, Electronics and hydrogen mobility. In the Americas, the portfolio of investment opportunities at 12 months included a majority of large projects in Electronics, supported by the Chips Act, as well as projects in the Large Industries business. The portfolio of opportunities beyond 12 months also includes the first significant projects related to the Inflation  Reduction Act in  the  United  States, particularly along the Gulf Coast.",

        "page_content": "## 2022 FINANCING\n\n## 'A' Category financial rating confirmed\n\nAir Liquide is rated by two main rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's. The long-term rating from Standard & Poor's is 'A' and from Moody's is 'A2', an improvement compared with 'A3' in 2021. These are in line with the Group's strategy. Moreover, the short-term ratings are 'A1' for  Standard  &  Poor's and 'P1' for Moody's, an improvement compared to 'P2' in 2021. Standard & Poor's confirmed its ratings on March 29, 2022 and gave them a stable  outlook. Moody's  announced  long-term and short-term rating upgrades on September 6, 2022 and gave them a stable outlook.\n\n## Diversifying and securing financial sources\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Group financing through capital markets accounted for 88% of the Group's total debt , for a total amount of outstanding bonds of 10.5 billion euros including all types of bonds, and 0.1 billion euros of commercial paper.\n\nThe total  amount of  credit  facilities was stable at 3.6 billion euros . The syndicated credit facility covers an unchanged amount of 2.5 billion euros and matures in December 2025. Since 2019, this facility includes an indexation mechanism of financial costs on three of the Group's CSR targets in the areas of carbon intensity, gender diversity, and safety.\n\nThe amount of total debt maturing in the next 12 months is 2.0 billion euros, slightly less than as of December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2022 issues\n\nIn September 2022, under the EMTN program, the Group issued a  public bond for an amount of 600 million euros ,  maturing  in 10 years.\n\nAt  the end of  2022,  outstanding  bonds  issued  under  the EMTN program amounted to 7.0 billion euros (nominal amount).\n\n## Net Debt by currency as of December 31, 2022\n\n|                    | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Euro               | 42%                 | 46%                 |\n| US Dollar          | 42%                 | 37%                 |\n| Japanese Yen       | 2%                  | 3%                  |\n| Chinese Renminbi   | N.C.                | 1%                  |\n| Taiwanese Dollar   | N.C.                | 4%                  |\n| South African Rand | 3%                  | 2%                  |\n| Others             | 11%                 | 7%                  |\n| TOTAL              | 100%                | 100%                |\n\nN.C.: non communicated\n\nInvestments  are generally funded in the currency in which the cash flows are generated, creating a natural currency hedge. In 2022, net debt decreased in US dollar and increased in euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese renminbi  and  in Taiwanese dollar.  The share of dollar in total net debt decreased in favor of these currencies.\n\n## Centralization of cash and funding\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide Finance continued to pool the cash balances of Group entities.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Air Liquide Finance had granted to Group subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, the equivalent of 12.6 billion euros in loans and received 3.1  billion  euros  in  excess  cash  as deposits from them. These transactions were denominated in 24 currencies (mainly the euro, US dollar, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, Chinese renminbi, British pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar). Approximately 400 subsidiaries are included in the Group cash pooling, directly or indirectly (including subsidiaries where cash pooling is carried out locally before being centralized at Air Liquide Finance).\n\n## Debt maturity and schedule\n\nThe average of the  Group's debt  maturity was 5.9 years at December 31, 2022, a slight decrease compared to December 31, 2021 (6.0 years). Due to the generation of net cash flow in 2022, bond issues reached maturity without the need for refinancing  and the  new  2022 bond was  issued  with a long  10 year maturity.\n\nThe following chart shows the Group's debt maturity  schedule. The single largest annual maturity represents approximately 12% of total debt.\n\n## DEBT MATURITY SCHEDULE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Commercial paper\n\n<!-- image -->",

Performance Indicators\n\nPerformance indicators used  by  the Group that are not  directly defined in the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the AMF position 2015-12 about alternative performance measures.\n\nThe performance indicators are the following:\n\n- \u25a0 Currency, energy and significant scope impacts;\n- \u25a0 Comparable sales change and comparable operating income recurring change;\n- \u25a0 Operating margin and operating margin excluding energy;\n- \u25a0 Reported and restated CO2 emissions;\n- \u25a0 Recurring net profit Group share;\n- \u25a0 Recurring net profit excluding currency effect;\n- \u25a0 Net Profit Excluding IFRS 16;\n- \u25a0 Net Profit Recurring Excluding IFRS 16;\n- \u25a0 Efficiencies;\n- \u25a0 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE);\n- \u25a0 Recurring ROCE.\n- \u25a0 Operating income recurring before depreciation and amortization excluding IFRS 16 at 2015 exchange rate to calculate the carbon intensity;\n\n## DEFINITION OF CURRENCY, ENERGY AND SIGNIFICANT SCOPE IMPACTS\n\nSince industrial and medical gases are rarely exported, the impact of currency fluctuations on activity levels and results is limited to euro translation impacts with respect to the financial statements of subsidiaries located outside the euro zone. The currency effect is calculated based on the aggregates for the period converted at the exchange rate for the previous period.\n\nIn addition, the Group passes on variations in the cost of energy (electricity and natural gas) to its customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium and long-term contracts. This indexing can lead to significant variations in sales (mainly in the Large Industries Business Line) from one period to another depending on fluctuations in prices on the energy market.\n\nAn energy impact is calculated based on the sales of each of the main subsidiaries  in Large Industries. Their  consolidation  allows the determination of the energy impact for the Group as a whole. The foreign exchange rate used is the average annual exchange rate for the year N-1. Thus, at the subsidiary level, the following formula provides the energy impact, calculated for natural gas and electricity respectively:\n\nEnergy impact = Share of  sales  indexed  to  energy  year  (N-1)  x (Average energy price in year (N) - Average energy price in year (N-1))\n\nThis indexation effect of electricity and natural gas does not impact the operating income recurring.\n\nThe significant scope effect corresponds to the impact on sales of all acquisitions or disposals of a significant size for the Group. These changes in scope of consolidation are determined:\n\n- \u25a0 for acquisitions during the period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for acquisitions during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the period the contribution of the acquisition between January 1 of the current period and the anniversary date of the acquisition;\n- \u25a0 for disposals during the period, by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity as of the anniversary date of the disposal;\n- \u25a0 for disposals during the previous period, by deducting from the aggregates for the previous period the contribution of the disposed entity.\n\nNote: exceptionally,  the acquisition of Sasol  production  units in 2021 had an impact in 2 steps on Group sales. After the acquisition of  the assets  in June 2021 (1 st step),  devices were installed on the units in 2022 in order to measure the energy consumed which, from October 2022 (2 nd step), could be reinvoiced to the customer according to the standard Large Industries contractual frame. For the sake of transparency in financial  communication,  sales  related  to  energy  consumed and contractually re-invoiced to the customer are identified within the significant scope and are therefore excluded from the comparable growth. This element will thus be accounted for in the significant scope during 12 months from October 2022.",

The operating margin excluding the energy impact corresponds to operating income recurring (which is not impacted in absolute value by the energy costs contractually re-invoiced to  Large Industries customers) divided by revenue restated for the energy impact to which the corresponding currency impact is attached. The ratio of operating\n\nincome recurring divided by revenue (whether restated or not for the energy impact) is calculated with a one decimal place rounded number. The variation between 2 periods is calculated as the difference between these rounded ratios, which can result in positive or negative differences compared to a more precise calculation, due to rounding.\n\n|                            |                | FY 2022   | Natural gas  impact  (a)   | Electricity  impact  (a)   | FY 2022,  excluding  energy impact   |\n|----------------------------|----------------|-----------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                    | Group          | 29,934    | 2,541                      | 1,073                      | 26,320                               |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 28,573    | 2,541                      | 1,073                      | 24,959                               |\n| Operating Income Recurring | Group          | 4,862     | -                          | -                          | 4,862                                |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 5,062     | -                          | -                          | 5,062                                |\n| Operating Margin           | Group          | 16.2%     | -                          | -                          | 18.5%                                |\n|                            | Gas & Services | 17.7%     | -                          | -                          | 20.3%                                |\n\nOperating income recurring before depreciation and amortization excluding IFRS 16 at 2015 exchange rate to calculate the carbon intensity\n\n| (in millions of euros and thousands of tonnes)                           | 2015   | 2022   | 2015/2022  change   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|\n| (A) Operating income recurring before depreciation and amortization      | 4,033  | 7,328  |                     |\n| (B) Currency impact (2015)  (a)                                          |        | (67)   |                     |\n| (C) IFRS 16 Impact  (b)                                                  |        | 252    |                     |\n| (A) - (B) - (C) = (D) EBITDA used for Carbon Intensity calculation       | 4,033  | 7,143  |                     |\n| (E) CO2-equivalent emissions (Scopes 1 + 2  (c) ) in thousands of tonnes | 29,413 | 39,306 |                     |\n| Carbon Intensity (E) / (D)                                               | 7.3    | 5.5    | -25 %               |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Environment and Society\n\nThe  extra-financial indicators monitored by the  Group as  part  of the ADVANCE strategic  plan are detailed in  the Integrated  Report included below (Chapter 1).\n\nThe Extra-financial Performance Declaration is presented in Chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\n## 6.1. ENVIRONMENT\n\nAir Liquide acknowledges the importance and urgency of climate issues. The Group's ambition is to participate in achieving the Paris Agreement,  which sets a  global framework designed  to  avoid  dangerous climate change  by limiting global warming  well below 2\u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLIMATE INITIATIVES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide believes the major challenges of our society can be overcome through an active and constructive dialogue.\n\nThis  is  why Air  Liquide has become an active member of the  TCFD  (Task  Force  for  Climaterelated Financial Disclosures), a working group which brings together institutional investors, audit firms  and  listed companies  whose  aim  is  to  formulate recommendations  on  information  to  be provided, on  a voluntary basis, relating to the financial risks associated with changes to  the climate. Air Liquide has also declared its support for the TCFD.\n\nThe  Sustainability  Accounting Oversight Board  (SASB) is  a  non-profit  organization  created in 2011, producing sustainable development reporting standards by industry sector.\n\nThe SASB takes the following elements into account when establishing its standards: environment; social capital; human capital; innovation and economic model; and leadership and governance.\n\nCross-reference tables are available in Chapter 5 pages 392 to 394 of the present Universal Registration Document which show the relationships between the recommendations from TCFD and  SASB and the  Air Liquide various  initiatives  and actions taken by Air Liquide.\n\nCO2 emissions inflection is one of ADVANCE's 3 strategic objectives. Accordingly, the ADVANCE strategic plan plan published in March 2022 reaffirms the ambition announced in 2021 to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, with two intermediary steps: starting to reduce its absolute CO2 emissions around 2025, then reaching a -33% decrease of  its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2035 compared to 2020 (1) . Moreover, the Group also maintained its existing objective to reduce by -30% its carbon intensity by 2025 compared to 2015 (2) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide's Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions reduction target for 2035 has been validated by the Science Based Target (SBTi) initiative as being compliant and in line with climate science ( a) . The Group was the first in its industry to obtain this validation from the SBTi.\n\nTo achieve the decarbonization of its assets, the Group has now set up processes to measure and control its CO2 emissions on a quarterly basis. Each geography of the Group has been allocated a yearly carbon budget and each new project is evaluated against the global trajectory of decarbonization.\n\nThe Group's scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in 2022 totaled 39 million metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent .  CO2 emissions (1) in 2022 changed by -0.3% compared to the 2020 baseline (1) . CO2 emissions (1) thus remained stable for the second consecutive year, in line with the ADVANCE plan's target of reaching an inflection point in 2025 before initiating a downward trend towards carbon neutrality in 2050 . In 2022, the Group\n\ncontinued to  deploy  the  levers  defined  in  the ADVANCE plan in order to align with the CO2 trajectory. Thus, several contracts (PPAs) to supply 350 MW of renewable electricity capacity were signed in 2022 in the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and South Africa. In addition, a number of energy efficiency projects were decided, as well as the electrification of two ASUs in China ultimately reducing the Group's emissions by approximately -1%. Lastly,  the  Group  is developing CO2 capture projects (selected for subsidies) on existing hydrogen production units.\n\nThe Group's carbon intensity remained stable at 5.5 kg of CO2equivalent per euro of EBITDA (2) .",

The quality of these published results illustrates the proven resilience of the Group's business model, characterized by a very broad diversity of geographies and markets, as well as the remarkable mobilization and responsiveness of its teams to adapt to this volatile environment.\n\nFor the Group, 2022 was also marked by the launch of ADVANCE ,  its  strategic  plan  for  2025,  which  closely  combines  financial  and extra-financial performance.  This  is already reflected  in  an acceleration  of  the investment momentum ,  which will  feed  the future growth, particularly in low-carbon hydrogen and the transition to a low-carbon society. On the extra-financial level, the Group's CO2 (1) emissions remained stable for the second consecutive year . This supports the Group's objective of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nAir Liquide has delivered another year of profitable growth: Sales reached 29.9 billion euros , up +7% on a comparable basis , the operating margin increased by +70 basis points excluding the energy impact, and recurring net profit (2) rose +17% at  constant exchange rates. At 10.3%, recurring ROCE (3) is higher than 10% , one year ahead of the target communicated as part of ADVANCE.\n\nAll activities are growing significantly : the Gas & Services businesses, which represents 95% of the Group's revenue, is up +6.1%, on a comparable basis, the Engineering & Construction business by +20.6% and Global Markets & Technologies by +25.8%. Within Gas & Services, all the geographies posted growth, in particular the Americas and Asia Pacific. By business line, the increase in sales was notably driven by Industrial Merchant and Electronics.\n\nThe Group further improved its operating margin by +70 basis points excluding the energy impact. It generated significant efficiencies amounting to 378 million euros and continued its dynamic management of its business portfolio. In a context of a sharp and lasting rise in energy prices, it demonstrated the strength of its business model ,  in  which Large Industries contracts are indexed to energy prices, and where its ability to create value allows it to adjust prices for its Industrial Merchant customers.\n\nThe investment decisions reached a record level of nearly 4 billion euros . 12-month investment opportunities remain plentiful and total 3.3 billion euros , out of which more than 40% are linked to the energy transition .\n\nCash flow on sales excluding the energy impact improved by +110 basis points, allowing the Group to finance its investments and pay a dividend, while at the same time reducing its debt. Reflecting the Group's confidence in the future, and following the allocation in 2022 of one free share for every 10 held, the dividend that will be submitted to the shareholders' vote in May amounts to 2.95 euros per share , i.e. an increase of +12.2% .\n\nIn 2023, Air Liquide will continue to roll out its ADVANCE strategic plan. The year is expected to be marked by the signing of several major projects in the field of decarbonization and energy transition in Europe and by an acceleration of these opportunities in the United States. Air Liquide is confident in its ability to further increase its operating margin and to deliver recurring net profit growth, at constant exchange rates (4) .\n\n<!-- image -->",

The most pertinent risks are identified in order to be addressed as a matter of priority through the drafting of prevention, mitigation or remedial measures ('Vigilance Plan' section of this chapter - page 95);\n- \u25a0 the EFPD, which is included in Chapter 5 of the Universal Registration Document - page 345, presents the Group's main extrafinancial risks and the related mitigation policies. Some of these risks, which meet the requirements of Prospectus Regulation III, are included in the 'Risk factors and management measures' section of this chapter.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT MEASURES\n\nThe Group identifies the risk factors to which it is exposed using a formal risk management approach. This presentation of risk factors and related management measures is based on the reference framework of the internal control and risk management system, developed under the supervision of the French financial markets authority (AMF). It was prepared with contributions from several departments (particularly Finance, Sustainable Development, Group Control and Compliance, Legal, Safety and Industrial Systems, etc.).\n\nThe risks presented below, at the date of this Universal Registration Document, are the risks that the Group considers may have a significant negative impact  on  its  business, results, outlook, or reputation, should they occur. The list of these risks is, however, not exhaustive and other risks, unknown at the date of this document, could occur and have  a negative effect on the Group's business.\n\nthey will occur or their potential impact by implementing internal control  and risk  management  procedures, as  well  as  formalized and specific action plans. These procedures, as well as the Group's  codes and policies, are included in a global reference manual, called the BlueBook , which is  the cornerstone  of the Group's internal control system and risk management.\n\nRisk factors are presented below as net risks (taking into account management measures already implemented) and divided into categories  according  to  their  nature.  In each category, the most significant risk factors are presented first (in bold).\n\nAlthough the risk categories have not been listed in order of importance, the two most significant specific risks for the Air Liquide Group are both related to its business: these are industrial risks and industrial investment-related risks.\n\nAs part of its risk management approach, the Group is committed to regularly assessing the risks and reducing the likelihood that\n\n## IMPACTS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nSince early 2020, the health crisis related to the global spread of covid-19 has increased some risk factors. As a result, the Group has applied adapted management measures in each country and each business.\n\n2022 saw the pandemic stabilize while remaining active, particularly in Asia, with an uneven global economic recovery. In this context, in 2022 the Group maintained the crisis management system put  in  place  at  the beginning  of 2020, with  adaptations\n\n(notably with operational business continuity plans  and remote working). The Group has also capitalized on the transfer of experience between geographies.\n\nThe impact of the pandemic is not of a nature to call into question the scope and classification of the Group-specific risk factors as presented in this Universal Registration Document.",

        "page_content": "## IMPACTS RELATED TO THE MILITARY CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE\n\nLike the health crisis, the  military conflict  between Russia and Ukraine increases some of the Group's risks or specific categories of risks. As a reminder, prior to the start of the conflict, Air Liquide's presence in Ukraine was limited to commercial and engineering representation for the Engineering & Construction business. The Group's revenue generated in Russia in 2021 was less than 1% of the Group's consolidated revenue.\n\nIn  the 3 rd quarter  of 2022, Air  Liquide  confirmed its  intention  to withdraw from Russia. As part of a responsible and orderly approach, the Group signed a letter of intent with the local executive management team to transfer its businesses in Russia to this team in the form of an MBO (Management Buy Out). The completion of this project remains subject to the approval of the Russian authorities. At the same time, due to the changing geopolitical context and local constraints, the Group's activities in Russia are no longer consolidated since September 1, 2022.\n\nThe financial  impacts are  detailed  in  note  1 to the  consolidated financial statements - page 270\n\nIn this context,  the Group has applied management  measures adapted to each type of activity, including in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 Human Resources  management-related  risks: in Ukraine, although the business is at a standstill, the Group has reorganized the work of its employees towards projects outside the country thanks to the use of digital tools. External listening and telephone support systems have been set up to provide psychological support to employees interested in such assistance. A  certain  number  of  humanitarian  initiatives  have been initiated and/or supported by the Group, in particular thanks to the commitment of employees through the 'Citizen at Work' program and the Air Liquide Foundation.\n- \u25a0 Industrial investment-related risks: in 2022, the Group's global  operations  were little  affected  by  the  conflict  between Ukraine and Russia. Air Liquide complies strictly with international sanctions.\n- \u25a0 Risks related to supplies: electricity and natural gas are the main  raw materials used in  the production units.  These two energies are impacted by an unprecedented increase in their prices and high volatility. Contracts with major customers are indexed to the  price  of  energy,  which  considerably limits  the impact on the Group's results. However, the consequences of the  conflict  in Ukraine  expose  the European  entities (mainly German, Dutch and Belgian) to a risk of natural gas rationing. Air  Liquide's  teams are  continuously  monitoring  the situation (storage levels, financial robustness of its suppliers, potential impacts on its customers, alternative raw materials (naphtha), etc.). In anticipation of any interruption in gas supplies, Air  Liquide  is  implementing  action  plans  in  collaboration  with its suppliers and customers. Furthermore, some customers may be  forced to shut down  their activities  due to a lack  of energy for their plants and processes. The current conflict has also had an impact on the availability of certain molecules (such  as  krypton  and  xenon). As far  as  possible, the  Group has reorganized its logistics flows to be able to supply its customers from other sources.\n- \u25a0 Digital risks: in  the current context of the conflict in Ukraine, which is conducive to cyberattacks, the Group has stepped up preventive actions such as intrusion tests on industrial and management systems, and campaigns to raise awareness among teams about the risk of phishing.\n- \u25a0 Regulatory and legal risks: in response to the conflict in Ukraine, sanctions have been put in place against Russia and Belarus, in particular by the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada. These sanctions have been followed up by countermeasures from the Russian government. The Group's specialist teams are monitoring these developments. They regularly inform the operational entities and support them in ensuring compliance with applicable laws. The Group seeks the opinions of external advisors and the validation of the French authorities, when necessary.\n\nAlthough this crisis increases the probability and impact of the aforementioned risk factors, it is not of a nature to call into question the scope and classification of the Group-specific risks as presented in this Universal Registration Document.\n\n| Risk categories                          | Risk factors                                                      |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                          | Industrial risks                                                  |\n|                                          | Industrial investment-related risks                               |\n|                                          | Energy sourcing-related risks                                     |\n| Business-related risks                   | Risks relating to the design and construction of production units |\n|                                          | Innovation-related risks                                          |\n|                                          | Human Resources management-related risks                          |\n|                                          | Customer risks                                                    |\n|                                          | Counterparty and liquidity risks                                  |\n| Financial risks                          | Foreign exchange risks                                            |\n|                                          | Interest rate risks                                               |\n| Digital risks                            | Digital risks                                                     |\n|                                          | Climate risks: greenhouse gas emissions                           |\n| Environmental and societal risks         | Climate risks: physical impact on Operations                      |\n|                                          | Societal risks (discrimination-related)                           |\n|                                          | Geopolitical risks                                                |\n| Geopolitical, regulatory and legal risks | Regulatory and legal risks                                        |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Business-related risks\n\nThe industrial gas business is characterized by a significant technology content (both in the design phase and the construction of  production units),  local  production  units,  high  capital intensity, and substantial energy requirements.\n\nVarious risks are associated with these characteristics. They are mitigated by various factors, which include primarily the diversity\n\n## 1.1. INDUSTRIAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIndustrial risks are linked to the various industrial products, processes  and  distribution  methods implemented by the  Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks relating to:\n\n- \u25a0 products: the intrinsic properties of industrial gases manufactured, transformed or packaged by the Group classifies them in the dangerous materials category; the use of these industrial gases requires specific means of control and protection in order to prevent risks such as:\n- -anoxia, associated with inert gases,\n- -over-oxygenation or fires, associated with oxygen and oxygen mixtures;\n- \u25a0 processes and their operation:\n- -cryogenics is used to separate gases by distillation, store them and transport them. This very low-temperature technique is connected with a risk of cryogenic burns from liquefied gases,\n- -likewise,  high-temperature  techniques, which are used in particular in the production of hydrogen, are particularly exposed to risks of burns, fire or explosions,\n- -in addition, pressure is central to the  Group's  processes. Pressurized equipment must be designed with safety devices which limit the risk of accidents caused by an uncontrolled increase of pressure;\n- \u25a0 logistics and transportation: each year, delivery vehicles, sales staff and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Non-compliance with the traffic regulations or the lack of regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents. In addition, industrial sites use a lot of motorized lifting equipment, which presents specific risks (collision, falling cylinders, etc.). Training and certification are thus required to operate them;\n- \u25a0 engineering  and construction: industrial risks are factored in and must commence at the design phase of future installations. During the construction phase, the lack of a strict accident prevention framework would affect the  coordination among the various stakeholders and expose teams to risks of accidents;\n- \u25a0 delivery reliability: the Group is exposed to the risk of faults in the systems supplying gas to customers, which could lead to a disruption to supply, in terms of quality or volumes;\n- \u25a0 any failure to comply with specific standards and regulations, in  particular in Healthcare, with the risk of non-compliance of products and services provided to customers and patients.\n\nof industries and customers served by the Group, the multiple gas applications  that it offers them, as well as the  large  number  of geographical locations in which it operates. In addition, a significant share of business is subject to contracts, a strict investment project authorization and management process, and a tailored energy policy.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSafety is a fundamental value for the Group and the 'zero accidents, on every site, in  every  region,  in every unit' ambition remains a key priority.\n\nThe Group is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, subcontractors, suppliers, customers and patients to professional and industrial risks.\n\nThe  safety results  for the  past  30-plus  years illustrate  the  longterm effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\nTo manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management System (IMS), which operates based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the accountability of the departments of the various Group entities for the effective implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the  issue  of  key  management and organizational procedures that aim to ensure:\n- -compliance with standards and regulations,\n- -management of skills (training,  qualifications  if necessary, and more),\n- -industrial risk management,\n- -hygiene, health and environmental management,\n- -road safety management,\n- -industrial emergency management,\n- -change management,\n- -maintenance management,\n- -monitoring of suppliers' products and services,\n- -installation project management,\n- -product development management,\n- -management of production and service provision,\n- -the analysis and treatment of incidents and accidents,\n- -management of industrial audits,\n- -the dissemination of shared technical standards within Group entities.\n\nThe IMS document base is continuously updated and enriched.\n\nThe Safety and Industrial Systems Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines, under the supervision of  a  member of the Executive Committee, supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  presentation  of various  dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of safety;\n- \u25a0 process audits to verify the implementation conditions and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough safety reviews prior to the start-up of any new facility to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical  audits  to  ensure the  compliance  of  operations  with Group rules.\n\nThe  evolution  of  safety  performances  of  operations  and of their level of compliance with IMS requirements are regularly monitored by the Executive Committee.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2. INDUSTRIAL INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group may be exposed to risks specific to its industrial investments. Each investment project may be affected, particularly in  its profitability,  by  the  impact  of  inflation, different factors linked primarily to project location and assessment of the local context, customer quality, good project management by the customer, and particularly the respect of implementation schedules, the competitiveness of the site, the environmental footprint or societal impact of the project, as well as the relevance of the design, the maturity of cost estimates, quality, and meeting construction deadlines and budgets for gas production units, including for suppliers.\n\nMoreover, in new emerging markets such as those related to energy transition, the  Group may be exposed, in addition to the above-mentioned risks, to risks related to the degree of maturity of some of these market segments or in certain geographies.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe BlueBook's Operations control policy sets out the principles of  the  strict  control  of the  Group's  industrial  investments and its commitments, the implementation of which is set out in the investment decisions procedure. The latter includes in particular:\n\n## 1.3. ENERGY SOURCING-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nElectricity  and  natural gas are the main  raw materials used  by production units. Their availability is thus essential to the Group. Where  the local  market permits,  Group subsidiaries secure the energy sourcing through mediumto long-term supply commitments and competitive bidding scenarios with local suppliers with the  objective of achieving the most  reliable and competitive energy costs, with a low -carbon footprint, available on the market.\n\nRisks to which the Group is exposed when sourcing raw materials relate to:\n\n- \u25a0 energy supply (access and reliability, in particular counterparty risk, etc.);\n- \u25a0 volumes (non-compliance with obligations  and commitments on volumes, etc.);\n- \u25a0 prices (volatility, competitiveness, etc.);\n- \u25a0 compliance with current regulations (market transparency rules, Sapin 2 Law, etc.);\n- \u25a0 changes in local regulations on energy and its deregulation;\n- \u25a0 their carbon footprint.\n\nFinancial risk relating to raw materials is described in note 25.1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 305.\n\nMoreover, and in addition to energy, the Group may be temporarily exposed to supply shortages for certain molecules which are only produced at a limited number of sites, in particular with worldwide reach, such as helium and rare gases.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nDue to the geographic spread of Group activities, its supply contracts are diversified.\n\n- \u25a0 a detailed review and approval process of investment requests based on very strict assessment criteria that include in particular consideration of the environmental impact of projects, as well as of any associated medium- and long-term contractual commitments, within the Resources and Investment Committees (described on page 45);\n- \u25a0 control of investment decisions through the specific follow-up of authorizations granted as well as contributions expected and seen during the initial years. In addition, the subsidiaries are obliged to report (above certain thresholds) all budget overruns and implement corrective action plans aimed at ensuring the profitability of the investments concerned; for the largest ones, they are supported by teams of experts ('Group Capital Implementation' teams) in order to secure good preparation and execution in particular for the largest projects;\n- \u25a0 more in-depth analysis of the profitability of certain major investments (comparative analysis prior and subsequent to completion).\n\nThe management of exposure to specific energy-sourcing risks is described in the Group's Energy management policy and is based on two principles:\n\n- \u25a0 energy purchasing must exclusively cover internal production needs ('own-use');\n- \u25a0 entities pass on energy cost fluctuations to their customers via indexed invoicing integrated into their medium- and long-term gas  supply  contracts.  The  risks  of  supplier  shortages/default are also covered by Force Majeure clauses in customer contracts.\n\nThe Group works to maintain these principles in the context of the supply of low-carbon  industrial  gases produced from renewable energy (for which new risks must be taken into account: long-term commitment, fixed price, intermittency, management of environmental certificates, etc.).\n\nThe 'E-Enrisk\" Group Energy & Emissions Risk Management Committee reviews the energy sourcing strategies of the entities, examines  the most  significant commitments submitted  to  it and ensures proper implementation of the climate objectives through the review of strategies to decarbonize production assets (both for investment decisions and for existing assets).\n\nEach month, this E-Enrisk Committee brings  together the Vice President in charge of the Large Industries World Business Line, the Energy Director, the Group Finance and Treasury Director as well as the Director in charge of Accounting policies and procedures, and the Sustainable Development Director. Meeting minutes are sent to all Executive Committee members.\n\nMoreover, risks relating to the sourcing of certain molecules produced at  a  limited  number  of  sites  with  worldwide reach  are managed by a strategy of diversifying sources, storing molecules and securing procurement through long-term contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

RISKS RELATING TO THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF PRODUCTION UNITS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide's engineering team designs and builds production units worldwide which are primarily intended for Group investments, but also for third-party customers.\n\nAs these projects  generally  extend  over  several  years,  they  are exposed, at their various stages, to risks relating to design, purchasing, transport or construction and more generally the overall quality, schedule and costs. Risks relating to these projects are often greater during the construction phase, in particular for turnkey projects:\n\n- \u25a0 the quality and delivery times for critical equipment, on the one hand, and on-site construction costs and deadlines on the other  may give rise  to project start-up  setbacks and impact project profitability;\n- \u25a0 unexpected technical  difficulties may  also  arise, in particular when a new innovative process is implemented;\n- \u25a0 certain projects are located in regions of the world that may be a source of specific political or economic risks.\n\n## 1.5. INNOVATION-RELATED RISKS\n\n## 1.5.1.  Technology-related risks\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group operates in a fast-moving environment, with the emergence of new products, new players, new business models and new technologies, thus creating a strong need for technological developments in its main markets, such as hydrogen energy or even Healthcare. These changes may impact the Group's activities or its position in a market. The Group's growth possibilities, therefore, depend on its ability to respond to this change over time.\n\nIn  terms  of  digital  technologies, the  Group  is  facing remarkable transformation challenges with  possible  impacts  on its  business model, its organization  and, ultimately,  its competitiveness.  The risk  to  which  the  Group  is  exposed  is  linked  in  particular  to  the rapid increase in the nature and volume, availability, security and quality  of  data,  whether  from  customers  and  patients  or  its  own assets.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group has introduced a dedicated structure to roll out its innovation strategy which focuses on two objectives: contributing to its  operational excellence  and  sustainable growth, based on new offerings, technologies and services. The Innovation and Development Division (IDD) therefore steers the innovation strategy on behalf of the Group's hubs, World Business Lines and operations, and contributes to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nDrawing on continuous reflection regarding new technologies and new markets, the  IDD is responsible  for  imagining, developing and incubating new solutions through to their launch on the market, in particular when related to offers with major technological content (including digital and IT), all while maximizing their impact and facilitating replication across all of the Group's businesses and geographies. To do this, it relies in particular on the strong exploration capacity of the Group's R&D, its organization as close  as possible to its customers with six Campuses on three continents, and  its integration in  innovation ecosystems.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nEngineering and project management teams have implemented a risk management system for the development and execution of all its projects (of varying size and complexity and which use different types of technology), which is described in the document specific to this activity, the 'Playbook'.\n\nThis system relies in particular on an Engineering Risk Committee and an Execution Review Board for the project management part. It aims to ensure a good risk assessment throughout the life of the projects as well as the implementation of appropriate management measures:\n\n- \u25a0 during the development stage: by identifying potential threats (but also opportunities) that may have an impact on the project's objectives during the forthcoming execution stage, thus allowing adequate decisions to be made;\n- \u25a0 during the execution stage: by continuing to regularly assess and mitigate already-identified risks which could change, occur or disappear, but also by identifying and dealing with any new threats which could have an impact on the contractual commitments, technical integrity or performance of the project right through until its completion.\n\nThe Group continually adapts its innovative approach and invests each year in research and development and digital technology. In recent years, it has strengthened its open innovation approach, in particular with the signing of long-term joint development agreements with key partners, regarding:\n\n- \u25a0 the energy transition and preservation of the planet (a significant portion of the innovation spend is allocated to the elaboration of new processes which consume less energy and allow CO2 emissions to be limited);\n- \u25a0 healthcare;\n- \u25a0 digital, data and artificial intelligence;\n- \u25a0 deep tech (cryogenic equipment, space exploration, etc.)\n\nFive Innovation Campuses and one Technologies Campus, located across the globe, aim to create a connected network which is open to its innovation partners -universities and technology institutes, suppliers, customers and start-ups; the Group thus relies on an ecosystem made up of more than 400 external partners.\n\nThe Group has put in place a robust innovation governance process, from idea  to market.  In  particular, it reviews initiatives whose results are not at the expected level - see page 47, and prioritizes initiatives with the highest impact each year.\n\nThe Group is introducing digital solutions into its internal operations and as part of its offerings, to improve efficiency and in particular help steer its industrial activities with greater speed and agility. For example, the rollout of Smart & Innovative Operations centers which facilitate the remote management of production at its sites, by drawing on predictive data analysis and artificial intelligence is one illustration of this. Moreover, the rollout of the Integrated Bulk Operations digitization program, aimed at digitizing the liquid products supply chain, provides Industrial Merchant customers  around  the  world with  access  to  a  service that guarantees greater reliability and safety, while improving the Group's efficiency and reducing its carbon footprint.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5.2.  Intellectual property-related risks\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe global environment shows particular interest in intellectual property as well as, in certain jurisdictions, greater attention to the protection of trade secrets. The Group's business is not significantly dependent on technologies patented by third parties; it relies mainly on technologies, processes, designs and software developed  internally,  in  particular by  its Innovation,  Digital &  IT, Engineering & Construction teams, its World Business Lines, and Operations teams. Innovation is also increasingly achieved in partnership with third parties; the Group develops certain innovative businesses through partnerships, buying shares in innovative entities, or acquisitions.\n\nLimitations on the Group's ability to protect, retain or enforce its intellectual property rights, including its trade secrets, could result in a loss of revenue and any competitive advantage that the Group holds. Third parties may also be able to develop an independent technology similar to that of Air Liquide without infringing its intellectual property rights or having access  to its trade secrets, which could harm the Group's financial position or profitability.\n\nAir Liquide, through its technologies, processes, designs and software,  always  makes sure to respect the intellectual  property rights of others. If a third party claims otherwise and in the event of litigation, regardless of the merits, such claims generally result in significant legal costs, including potential damage to the Group's reputation. Risks may also arise in the treatment of confidential information, including trade secrets, of third parties in the Group's day-to-day operational activities or the context of collaborations.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nGovernance relating to intellectual property and related risk management principles are set out in the Group Policy and procedures aimed at:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring  the  protection  of  the  Group's  intellectual  assets,  by protecting the Group's inventions, designs, brands and software;\n- \u25a0 ensuring that Air Liquide complies with all valid intellectual property rights of third parties in all its areas of activity;\n- \u25a0 in the case of partnerships and collaborations with third parties,  supporting stakeholders  within  the Group to manage risks related to intellectual property;\n- \u25a0 raising  awareness among  employees of the  risks  relating  to intellectual property.\n\nTo this end, the Group relies on an Intellectual Property Department whose employees are based at  the Group's head office and in the main geographic regions.\n\nTo the Group's knowledge, there are no legal or arbitration proceedings relating to intellectual property, either current or threatened, which may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.\n\n## 1.6. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT RELATED RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe long-term performance of the Air Liquide Group is driven, in particular, by the quality of its employees, their skills and  their commitment.\n\nIn its businesses, the Group aims to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the  right place, in particular in markets where the  Group is expanding its activities, or in geographies where the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop skills, in particular with the digitization of its businesses and the emergence of new skills (data science and artificial intelligence, etc.) and new professions (Hydrogen).\n\nThe corresponding risks would arise, in particular, from shortcomings in:\n\n- \u25a0 the level or quality of training;\n- \u25a0 the management of careers and opportunities; and\n- \u25a0 the recognition of performances and contributions, in particular in certain areas of expertise.\n\nIn  addition  to  risks relating  to  skills  management,  psycho-social risks may also affect the health and level of commitment of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where remote working has been rapidly implemented during periods of lockdown.\n\nFurthermore, Air Liquide contributes to economic and social growth in the 73 countries (1) where it operates through its technical, industrial, medical and economic activities. The Group, therefore, identifies and applies the applicable laws and regulations, in particular in terms of working conditions and freedom of association.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group is committed to identifying, attracting and developing the necessary scientific, technical and digital skills required for its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and responsibilities of the different parties in their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 acquisition  and  sustainability  of  the  necessary  skills. Training is provided under the Air Liquide University brand with, in particular, reinforced e-learning courses followed by more than 60,200 users in 2022 in a wide range of domains (ethics and anti-corruption, industrial safety, competition law, digital security, management, etc.). They are the subject of a structured  program and are managed  by  a  specific learning management system (LMS);\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their individual development throughout their  career, particularly  enabled  by  a  centralized career and skills management tool (TMS: Talent Management System) and the communication of career advancement opportunities (TAS: Talent Acquisition System);\n- It should be noted that Air Liquide has begun a transformation of its HR processes. The Workday software is being deployed in several phases until 2024.\n- \u25a0 changes in working methods within the Group. The organization of work must therefore not only meet the demands and expectations of today's employees and of Air Liquide, but also those of tomorrow, while being based on the Group's fundamentals. The result of a co-creation bringing together more than 700 employees, the Group thus deployed in 2020 its new Be Act Engage model, which allows its employees to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver sustainable performance;\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition  to employee  remuneration and loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees), specific provisions aimed at promoting and sustaining certain skills, such as inventor and innovator recognition programs, the technical expertise development scheme (Technical Community  Leaders) in a  wide  range of fields such as industrial operations, industrial safety and, since 2019, digital and IT.\n\nMore generally, the Group ensures the building of a performancefocused, attractive and collaborative professional environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of Group employees in their workplace. The measurement and monitoring\n\n## 1.7. CUSTOMER RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe primary customer risk is the risk of bankruptcy or closure of a customer's production site.\n\nMore generally, the business of some of the Group's customers may be interrupted following natural or man-made disasters, including those resulting from changes in weather conditions, pandemics, climate change, or following major political events.\n\nThe amount of  operating receivables  as well as  provisions for doubtful receivables are shown in note 17 'Trade receivables' to the consolidated financial statements on page 284.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe diversity of the Group's geographic presence across 73 countries (2) ,  as  well  as  the  industries  and  sectors in which it works, helps distribute customer risk. The Group's entities serve a very large number of customers (more than two million worldwide) in a broad range of industries: chemicals, steel, metals, refining, food, pharmaceuticals, automotive, healthcare, electronics, photovoltaics, research laboratories, etc.\n\nThe Group's largest customer  represents 2,2%  of revenue, the Group's top 10 customers represent around 15% of revenue and the top 50 customers represent around 35% of revenue.\n\n## 2. Financial risks\n\nThe Group's financial policy sets out the management principles for  the financial risks to which its  business is exposed. In this context, the Group has defined and regularly reviews the terms of the financial procedures which forbid speculative transactions notably on financial instruments.\n\nFinancial decision-making governance is the responsibility of the two Finance Committees (Strategic Finance Committee and Operational Finance Committee), with the former considering issues relating to the financing strategy and the latter dealing with the practical methods of its implementation.\n\n## 2.1. COUNTERPARTY AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nCounterparty risk primarily relates to trade receivables, outstanding amounts on short-term investments and derivative hedging instruments, and to credit facilities contracted with each bank.\n\nTrade receivables risks relate to receivables on the balance sheet that may remain unpaid in the long term, in particular in the event of the financial hardship of a customer.\n\n(2)\n\nof the commitment of employees are carried out using an employee feedback tool called 'My Voice'. Operations and support  functions  use the results from My  Voice  to define and implement tailored action plans.\n\nThe growth in working from home has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. Employees' adjustment to this new way of working was facilitated  by  the existence  of a  digital and  collaborative environment  that had already  been  rolled out within the Group several years ago, as well as the development of virtual training courses covering remote working and team management.\n\nA significant part of the Industrial Gas  business is covered  by customer contracts, with commitment periods specific to the relevant business line:\n\n- \u25a0 the  Large Industries business  and a third of the Electronics business  mainly rely  on 15to  20-year take-or-pay secured contracts, ensuring a guaranteed minimum revenue and offering strong future cash flow predictability;\n- \u25a0 the contracts in the Industrial Merchant business, generally with a duration of one to five years, also include services relating to storage and cylinders over the lifetime of the supply contract;\n- \u25a0 in the Healthcare business, positions vary between health systems, with certain countries awarding one to five-year contracts on a regional and pathology basis following invitations to tender.\n\nFinally, the impact on the Group of the risks of customer business interruption following major climatic or political events is limited by the wide  diversity  of  countries  in  which  it operates. This impact can be offset by the necessary recourse to gases or equipment manufactured by the Group in critical situations. Gases are needed to secure industrial or chemical facilities (inert gases), maintain local industrial activity (essential to industrial processes) or even sustain life (medical gases and equipment). The Group's businesses are therefore often protected or prioritized depending on the situation.\n\nInvestment risk is mainly related to short-term deposits in the event that one of the Group's key banks defaults and, to a lesser extent, an impairment loss due to the use of monetary funds for a portion of the portfolio.",

This assessment is then taken into account in the payment terms proposed to customers.\n\nFor the Group's major customers (around 170 customers, generating 40% of sales), counterparty risk is monitored on a monthly basis using ratings provided by financial rating agencies, or via an internal financial rating when an explicit published rating does not exist. The actual structure of contracts, in particular for Large Industries and Electronics, reduces risks in that these medium- to long-term contracts include safeguarding clauses for the Group.\n\nIn certain cases (mainly Europe and the United States), the risk of losses  on  trade receivables is  transferred  to  the banks  through non-recourse factoring programs.\n\n## 2.2. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group, due to its international presence, is naturally exposed to  foreign  currency  fluctuations  with,  on  one  hand,  a  transaction risk and, on the other hand, a risk relating to the translation of its financial statements into euros (the Group's reporting currency).\n\nForeign exchange  transaction risk relates,  on one  hand, to the foreign currency commercial cash flows of operating entities and, on the other hand, cash flows arising from royalties, technical support and dividends.\n\nTranslation risk relates to the publication of the Group's financial statements in euros from the entities' financial statements in local currencies,  without  an impact  on the  profitability of  the Group's businesses.\n\nNote  24.5  to  the  consolidated financial statements  presents net debt by currency on page300 and note 25.1 to the consolidated financial  statements  on  pages  301  to  305 describes  the foreign exchange risk management process, as well as the derivative instruments used and sensitivity to foreign currency exchange rates.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nSince industrial and medical gases are not transported over long distances, most products are manufactured in the country where they are sold. The Group considers that its activities and its profitability have a low level of exposure to currency fluctuations.\n\nMoreover, to reduce risks relating to the default of a financial counterparty, the Group has adopted a conservative approach to its short-term investments and only works with leading banks and financial institutions rated at least A or A2 by Standard & Poor's or Moody's,  over the  long  term,  except in  exceptional  and  justified circumstances.\n\nInvestments must therefore be made with key banks (i.e. leading banks selected according to their financing resources, their geographical and product coverage, as well as their financial stability), with maturities of less than three months, be highly liquid and have low volatility. The ratings of key banks and risk indicators available on the markets are monitored on a daily basis using real-time financial information services.\n\nCash pooling with the help of international cash pooling (a daily leveling system  towards  Air Liquide Finance) and the  policy  of annual extraction of subsidiaries'  dividends  also helps limit the amount of local cash in each country.\n\nTo minimize the risk relating to the market value of hedging derivatives  used to  manage currency  and interest  rate  risk and that of fluctuations in raw material and energy prices, the Group works with its key banks on one hand, while also ensuring it diversifies its  transactions.  These transactions  are  governed  by Framework contracts (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Bancaire Fran\u00e7aise or International  Swaps and  Derivatives Association contracts).  The Group has decided not to use a collateralization mechanism due to the low  average duration of these derivatives  and  the cash fluctuations that may result from margin call mechanisms.\n\nFinally, in terms of financing, to ensure its development and independence, the Group ensures that it has sufficient and permanent sources of liquidity, meaning adequate financing resources available  at any time and at the lowest cost from  a large range of key banks and financial markets.\n\nThe Group has nevertheless defined methods for hedging its main foreign exchange risks, whether this is borne by the holding companies or the operating entities, in terms of authorized hedging instruments, the  decision  process and  the  execution  of transactions.\n\nThese measures are supplemented by management rules adapted to local circumstances, which are aimed at ensuring compliance and security of transactions and optimizing management.\n\nThe application of this financial policy is controlled by the Finance Department. The majority of transactions are executed directly on a centralized basis with the subsidiaries and over-the-counter markets, which is completed by consolidated reports provided by various Group entities on a monthly or quarterly basis, depending on the type of risk.\n\nThe activities are managed on the basis of highly separated duties, using a multilateral negotiation platform, cash management software,  and a communication  platform  linked  to the international banking communication network 'SWIFT'. An independent auditor was commissioned in  2021 to assess the Group's level of compliance with the Swift Customer Security Program. The assessment showed that the ecosystem and internal security procedures are in line with Swift requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Thus,  financing  is  raised  either  in  local  currency  or,  when  sales\n\n## 2.3. INTEREST RATE RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe interest rate risk  is  mainly  linked  to  the  fluctuation  of  future cash flows on debt when the rate is variable.\n\nIn case of a significant increase in interest rates upon future renewals of bonds, the Group may find itself obliged to devote a more significant portion of cash flows from its operational activities to service its debt.\n\nNote  24.3 to the consolidated financial  statements  page 298 presents the fixed-rate portion of debt and note 25.1 to the consolidated financial  statements  -  pages  301  to  305  describes the sensitivity  of  the  Group's  financial  expenses  to  interest  rate fluctuations and the interest rate repricing schedule for fixed-rate debt and interest rate risk hedging instruments.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's strategy is to maintain, over a medium- to long-term period, a majority of total debt at fixed rates, notably by using firm or option hedges.\n\n## 2.4. TAX RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to tax risk in certain countries, due to changes in applicable regulations, which may have an impact on its activities or its results. This risk may arise from:\n\n- \u25a0 unfavorable changes in local or international regulations;\n- \u25a0 challenges in the application of current regulations or standards;\n- \u25a0 errors when completing tax returns;\n- \u25a0 regular audits by tax authorities which could lead to disagreements over the interpretation of facts.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, the Group focuses on complying with laws and  regulations.  Modifications  of laws and regulations  are followed and monitored by its Tax Department and its local Finance Departments.\n\nThe Group's tax Charter supports its ambition to remain a leader in its sector by acting in a responsible manner, consistent with the Group's long-term growth strategy. Air Liquide has defined the following principles which govern its tax policy, in line with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code:\n\n- \u25a0 Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as well as  the international  standards that  affect it such  as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer prices;\n- \u25a0 Group entities ensure that tax returns and payments are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. It aims to operate in a transparent manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities;\n\ncontracts are indexed in euros or US dollars, in foreign currency (EUR or USD).\n\nCentralized interest rate hedging methods have also been defined for each major currency in which debt is held (in particular EUR, USD, JPY,  and CNY, which  represent  around  85% of  total net debt) including:\n\n- \u25a0 the selection of authorized tools, in particular swaps and interest rate options;\n- \u25a0 hedging decision processes;\n- \u25a0 methods of executing transactions.\n\nFor debt in other currencies, rules have been defined in order to ensure that the  transactions initiated  to  hedge  interest rate risk are consistent with Group objectives.\n\nMoreover, pre-hedging transactions for future highly probable issues are regularly implemented to protect the Group against an increase in interest rates.\n\nWith few exceptions, all  interest rate  transactions  are centrally processed by Air Liquide Finance, and regularly valued using both internally designed tools and an independent specialized firm.\n\n- \u25a0 the Group deals with tax-related matters by banning tax havens and does not make use of shell  corporations  without economic or commercial substance;\n- \u25a0 the Group protects value for its shareholders by taking measures to minimize double taxation phenomena. Furthermore, it acts to minimize fiscal risk. Its tax strategy is in line  with  the  Group's strategy and complies with the Code of Conduct.\n\n## Tax policy followed by the Group\n\nAir Liquide applies a tax compliance and transparency policy, guaranteed by the presence of qualified and dedicated teams of tax  experts who are  up to date with  the  latest tax reforms and respect the Group's values. The Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. In the countries where it operates, the Group maintains transparent, constructive and longterm relationships with the tax authorities, providing them with the information they  need within  a reasonable period  of time. L'Air Liquide  S.A.,  on its  own behalf and  on behalf of  its integrated French subsidiaries, is the first company to sign the 'Fiscal Partnership' with the French tax authorities. By signing this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries have entered a trust-based, transparent relationship with the French tax authorities. This commitment continues without interruption.\n\nThe Group ensures that its operations comply with tax regulations, so that it pays an appropriate amount of tax according to the  place  where the  value  of  its business  activity  is  created, without artificially transferring value within low-tax jurisdictions.\n\nThe Group does not use opaque structures or entities in tax havens and does not withhold useful information from the tax authorities. It does not use structures that lack economic or commercial substance.",

As the  Group's organizational structure is decentralized, its intra-group transactions are very limited and do not represent more than 15% of total sales. The Group applies an intra-group cash flow policy that complies with the OECD principles.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the 'Country-by-Country Reporting' (CBCR) obligations.\n\n## Organization and governance of the tax function\n\nThe subsidiaries' tax affairs are the responsibility of their Finance Departments. Due to their size, some subsidiaries have a specialized Tax Department reporting to the Finance Department, such as in France, the United States, Germany, China, Canada, Italy, Benelux and Spain. In some cases, a geographic hub Tax Department reporting to the hub's Finance Department has been set up to coordinate taxation in several countries, such as in South-East Asia and Africa / Middle East.\n\nAll  these  country  or  regional Tax  Departments have a functional link with the Group's Tax Department, which is based at the head\n\n## 3. Digital risks\n\n## 3.1. DIGITAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nThe Group's activities, expertise and, more generally, its relations with all the stakeholders (suppliers, customers, banks, communities of experts, etc.) depend on increasingly dematerialized and digitized operations. These operations rely on interdependent information systems and communication networks both in functional, technical, as well as human level terms.\n\nThe Group's pursuit of this digital acceleration increases its exposure to risks relating to data integrity, availability, security and confidentiality as well as the availability of IT systems and applications. For data confidentiality, the increase in expectations and  requirements  for  protection  also  adds  the  risk  of  regulatory non-compliance.\n\nThese risks, which impact all economic and political players, are increasing in intensity due to the severity and frequency of digital attacks and to their changing nature (historically, cyber risks constituted industrial espionage or data hacking and have come to involve the risks of cyber criminality, malware and ransomware, where the user often plays a decisive role). These attacks, which spread at high velocity, have the potential to affect all of the Group's  regions and  businesses,  with significant impacts on its industrial processes (disturbance of production or distribution activities), its capacity for communication, notably internal, and its image (digital identity theft, dissemination of false information, etc.).\n\nThe increase in remote working and the changing geopolitical environment also expose the Group to potential cyberattacks.\n\noffice. The latter coordinates the network of tax teams, in particular  through  regular  meetings  to  identify  significant issues, provide the appropriate technical support and the necessary guidance. Given that the Group's businesses make it a significant contributor to the tax revenues of the countries in which it operates, and since the Group  is subject  to  a high number of taxes and duties as well as unstable tax regimes in certain countries, the Tax Departments conduct a tax watch.\n\nThe Group Tax Department is part of the Group's Finance Department. It maintains links with the various financial, legal and other organizations in order to keep abreast of the Group's operations.  It  participates  in  the  Finance  Committee,  an  internal Group committee, to ensure the tax position complies with the Tax Charter. The Department presents the Group's main tax risks to the Audit and Accounts Committee at least once a year. In addition, given the importance of the negotiations underway at the OECD to  develop the so-called Pillar 1  and Pillar 2 rules, the Group's Tax Department joined the OECD working groups in 2021 and 2022 and will participate constructively in this work for as long as necessary.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe  Digital Security  Policy describes the  digital  security  issues, sets  the basic  rules governing  the handling of associated risks, and outlines the roles and responsibilities in this area. It is accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 codes outlining principles to be respected by users and IT administrators;\n- \u25a0 procedures  describing, in  particular,  how  to  secure  data and applications, detect and deal with incidents.\n\nThe Digital Security Department, attached to the General Control and Compliance Department, defines the main areas of focus in a multi-year operational program, and specifies the short-term action plans, in the light of a risk analysis that is updated annually. It  coordinates  them in  collaboration  with  the  Digital &  IT  teams, among others, and deploys them by relying on dedicated resources in the hubs, clusters, World Business Lines and World Business Units. The main lines of work revolve around:\n\n- \u25a0 risk prevention and awareness raising for employees regarding issues such as fraud and the theft of personal and confidential data, with teaching tools such as e-learning courses on information  protection (notably  personal  or sensitive data) or the  use  of IT tools  and phishing campaigns (with a  focus  on employees who have been repeatedly tricked). Risk prevention measures in the event of remote working have been strengthened, in particular in the management of remote access to IT systems;\n- \u25a0 protection of critical applications, the most sensitive information, industrial assets, as well as taking digital security into account from the project design phase, as an intrinsic dimension of any digital solution;\n\n<!-- image -->",

Environmental and societal risks\n\n## 4.1. ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS\n\n## 4.1.1.  Climate risks: greenhouse gas emissions\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir  Liquide's  business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gas needs of its customers who often emit greenhouse gases themselves, in particular in the metals, chemicals and refining industries.  This outsourcing  is justified by  Air Liquide's expertise which allows to optimize the energy consumption of production tools and favors low-carbon energy procurement. However,  it  leads  to  the transfer of a portion  of  the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nAlmost 85% of Air Liquide's large production units are Air Separation Units, which  do not use any  combustion processes and therefore do not emit CO2 and consume almost exclusively electrical energy.  Electricity  used by the Group  to  power these units generate CO2 emissions at electricity suppliers; such emissions are classified as indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe Group's two other main CO2-emitting activities are hydrogen production  and co-generation.  These  account  for  nearly  15%  of large production units and use combustion processes emitting CO2, known as direct emissions (Scope 1).\n\nIn this respect,  the climate risk (greenhouse  gas emissions) is closely linked to the access to renewable electricity sources and implementation by public authorities of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies such as, for example, the introduction of a carbon price or more stringent regulations, that may impact:\n\n- \u25a0 either the Group's plants (direct impact on the operational scope), resulting  in  increased  production  costs  and  the  need for new investments;\n- \u25a0 or those of its suppliers, resulting in price increases;\n- \u25a0 or  customers (indirect  impact  on  the value chain),  impacting, for instance, their market, processes and industrial gases needs.\n\nAir Liquide is present in regions across the globe that have implemented or are in  the  process  of  implementing greenhouse gas emissions trading schemes. If the share of emissions covered by free allowances decreases, the Group may be required to introduce compensatory measures. It should be noted that longterm contracts foresee a transfer of CO2 costs to customers.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nTo reinforce the climate objectives announced in November 2018 which set the framework under which the Group takes active measures for the climate in its operations, with its customers and ecosystems by offering low -carbon solutions, Air Liquide announced new sustainable development objectives on March 23, 2021. In line with the Paris Agreement, and to face the urgency of taking climate change and energy transition into account, Air Liquide has shown its commitment by setting itself the ambition of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, with two major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 a -33% reduction in Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions (1) by 2035, compared with a 'market-base' 2020 Scopes 1 and 2 baseline (2) .\n\nThe objective of reducing carbon intensity by -30% by 2025 relative to 2015 emissions ( 3 ) has been maintained.\n\nA Climate Policy  published  in  the BlueBook (4) in  2022  aims  to consolidate the principles governing Climate risk management within the Group, as well as across the entire value chain.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of the Group's climate objectives are based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  internal greenhouse gas emission  monitoring procedure, which sets out the monitoring of current greenhouse gas emission regulatory obligations with which the Group must comply; the methodology for calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 integration of the monitoring of the CO2 trajectory performance in  the  Group's management process, in particular the budget process, which now includes the allocation of a carbon budget to the various geographies, as well as quarterly monitoring by geography and business line at the Executive Committee level;",

For all its projects,  for  all geographies, and even those without a current official price for CO2, Air Liquide integrates a CO2 price sensitivity study into its investment decision process. Various values are used, including a reference cost of 50 euros per metric ton of CO2, the current local price, as well as a high value of 100 euros or more per metric ton depending on local circumstances;\n- \u25a0 the roll out of the 'Climate Champions' network and the regular review of the decarbonization plan of each cluster (group of countries);\n- \u25a0 the assumption of the introduction, in the regions in which the Group  operates,  of public policies  aimed  at  stepping up the transition  toward  a  low-carbon  economy that is  in  line  with  a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory, validated in 2022 by SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative).\n\nIn addition, information regarding the European Union (EU) 'Taxonomy Regulation' is available in paragraph 2.5 of chapter 5 of this Universal Registration Document (page 375).\n\n## 4.1.2.  Climate risks: physical impact on Operations\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the world  exposed  to changes (in amplitude or frequency) in exceptional meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down or interrupt the Group's operations or make them more expensive. Its  suppliers  and  customers are  also  confronted  with this same issue.\n\n## A distinction is made between:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which are increasing: storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to more long-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in their variability, the disappearance of certain resources, etc.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nPhysical risks (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.)  are appraised during  the  review  of  investment  requests, in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example in the design of equipment.\n\nIn addition, Group operations which are regularly exposed to the acute  risks described  above  have risk  management  systems in place aimed at adopting suitable preventive operational measures and  at  managing  these crises by,  first and  foremost, protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, in particular in the design of production units, in the same way and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\nThese risks are also taken into account in the preparation of the financial statements (note 31).\n\n## 4.2. SOCIETAL RISKS (DISCRIMINATION-RELATED RISKS)\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nAir Liquide  operates  businesses in  a  large  number  of  countries with different cultures. It is therefore naturally exposed to discrimination risks relating  in  particular  to gender mix (gender disparity, particularly in technical and expert professions), diversity (skin color, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc.), age or disability, etc.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nThe Group's Principles of Action and the Code of Conduct reaffirm the Group's values and, more specifically, a culture based on diversity, openness, transparency, respect for others and the rejection of all forms of discrimination. These values are also included in the Human Resources policy and must be promoted by all  Group employees, with the support of Human Resources, through awareness-raising, training tools and the monitoring of progress indicators.\n\nMoreover, for several years, Air Liquide has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, for which one of the principles aims to contribute to the elimination of all forms of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nTo this end, actions are regularly taken to promote gender mix (for example to increase the number of women among managers and professionals to 35% by 2025), nationality mix (Air Liquide's senior executives are now of 35 different nationalities), and inclusion (in particular, a review of the policy relating to employees with  disabilities). Details  of  the  actions  carried  out  by  the  Group are indicated on pages 350 to 353.\n\n<!-- image -->",

GEOPOLITICAL RISKS\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nConsidering the changing international climate, including increasing tensions between or in some countries and the persistence of  terrorist  threats, the  Group may  be  exposed in certain countries to  economic  or  financial risks, as well as to risks affecting the safety of its employees (on-site or during business travel) and the security of its facilities.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nWhen investment requests are reviewed, the geopolitical context of  a  project  (in  both  safety  and  economic  terms)  is  part  of  the criteria examined before any approval: country risk is thus assessed on a case-by-case basis and may lead to adjustments to financing strategy and supplementary insurance cover, or even the rejection of the project.\n\nMoreover, all countries in which the Group operates are subject to monitoring and regular analysis of the geopolitical context.\n\nFinally, the Safety and Industrial Systems Department uses awareness-raising and training tools to protect employees, travelers and expatriates who are potentially exposed in certain regions or when traveling for business: e-learning, prior intervention from specialists on certain specific risks (health, hygiene, pollution, kidnapping,  etc.).  Other  measures  are  also implemented locally to secure products and sites that are most exposed to an external threat.\n\n## 5.2. REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS\n\n## 5.2.1.  Risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Identification and description of risks\n\nIn  all the  countries where the  Group  operates, its entities  are exposed to the risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. In an increasingly complex context due to a continuously rising number  of standards, they  must monitor  changes to the  legal and regulatory framework notably in terms of the specificities of the businesses that they conduct.\n\nThe Healthcare business line, in particular, is subject to specific regulations for the products that it sells (medical devices, drugs), the research activities that it carries out, and for the processing of patients' personal healthcare data.\n\nThe Group must face,  in  all regions  in which it  operates, the risks of non-compliance with:\n\n- \u25a0 competition law;\n- \u25a0 provisions aimed at combating corruption;\n- \u25a0 regulations restricting exports of certain products or relating to destinations under sanctions;\n- \u25a0 regulations on the transfer of personal data (see 3.1. Digital risks - page 85);\n- \u25a0 the duty of vigilance.\n\nGroup entities are  also  exposed  to  the  risk of non-compliance with contractual obligations (of their own or those of their contractual counterparties).\n\nLiabilities and contingent liabilities related to disputes are described in notes 22 and 30 of the consolidated financial statements - pages 289 and 309.\n\n## Risk management measures\n\nChanges to legal and regulatory requirements are monitored with particular vigilance and are accompanied by the implementation of procedures aimed at improving teams' knowledge of these changes and related risks and providing them with tools to ensure compliance with obligations in the following fields, through:\n\n- \u25a0 Group Codes on how to behave in order to comply with competition laws, accompanied by surprise audits and training that includes e-learning;\n- \u25a0 a corruption prevention program in which Executive Management and management are closely involved; this program relies in particular on the mapping of corruption risks, the updated Code of Conduct, a full set of training and awareness-raising actions  for  those exposed  to  corruptionrelated risks, a third-party assessment mechanism, accounting controls and a whistleblowing system. This program is regularly updated to take into account new regulatory and legal requirements under the  coordination of the Group's Ethics Officer, who relies on a network of ethics correspondents and the support of the Operational Departments in the hubs and businesses; it is regularly audited;\n- \u25a0 a guidance document for export control and international sanctions, as well as a tool and procedures for verifying third parties;\n- \u25a0 various contract guides (for Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Electronics, Engineering & Construction and Financing) and Codes of Good Practices (for Healthcare);\n- \u25a0 the  establishment of  a  specific department to  deal with  the legal challenges of the law on the duty of vigilance.\n\nTo the Group's knowledge, there are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, either current or threatened, which may have or have had, in the past 12 months, significant impacts on the Group's financial situation or profitability.",

        "page_content": "## CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nThis section describes the key elements of the control and risk management environment instituted by the Company.\n\n## 1. Organization\n\nThe Group is organized and based on a consistent Group strategy. It is supported by a method of management which centers on mid-term objectives that are categorized by business, as well as a steering process for activities based on annual budgetary objectives, which are further  categorized  down  to  the individual plan level. As part of the ADVANCE corporate program, the Group continued to rely on a network organization that promotes communication and shortens decision-making circuits.\n\nThe organization breaks down into:\n\n- \u25a0 hubs which ensure the presence and representation of the Group in the main global regions. With the Base (L'Air Liquide S.A. head office), they are responsible for defining the Group's operational strategy and its global performance. They accommodate the representatives  of  the  Corporate functions and World Business Lines who ensure that the Group strategy is properly implemented locally;\n- \u25a0 entities, grouped in  clusters (groups of countries) for better pooling of resources, which provide operational management of their  activities and  implement  the Group strategy  in those countries where the Group has a presence;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Lines, which:\n- -with the hubs and Strategy Department, prepare the medium-term strategic goals for the businesses they represent,\n- -have responsibility for strategic marketing, the transformation of their respective businesses, industrial policy  and  the  suitability  of  skills  in their  specific  areas  of business;\n- \u25a0 the World Business Units specific to certain businesses (Global Markets & Technologies, Engineering & Construction);\n- \u25a0 the Innovation and Development Division (IDD), which brings together all the research and innovation resources, technology development, Digital & IT (La Digital Factory, ALIZENT, network infrastructure and more), the Intellectual Property Department, the ALIAD investment fund and the Global Markets & Technologies (GM&T) World Business Unit (WBU) mentioned above.\n\nThis organization also includes the Corporate functions, which notably comprise the three key control departments that report to Executive Management:\n\n- \u25a0 the Finance Department, which is responsible for:\n- -the reliability of accounting and financial information,\n- -the Group's financial and tax risk management,\n- -the drafting of Group objectives and monitoring of performance by operations control, based on financial data prepared by the accounting teams, analysis conducted by the financial teams of the various entities as well as certain operational data;\n- \u25a0 the Group Control and Compliance Department, which:\n- -provides  expertise and  assistance to  entities in their risk management approach (see below) and builds a Group synthesis,\n\n- -helps Group entities ensure compliance with and promotion of both the Group's ethical values, particularly through training and awareness-raising measures and the treatment of fraud and deviations (all these measures, organizations, and tools are presented in detail in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration -page 345), as well as compliance with duty of vigilance  measures and with international trade regulations,\n- -verifies the effective application of internal control and risk management procedures through audits carried out according  to  a  defined  program  presented  to  the Group's Audit and Accounts  Committee. This  program, developed and based on the risk  analysis,  is  regularly  monitored by the Audit and Accounts Committee in liaison with the Environment and Society Committee (for environmental and societal issues). Audit Reports are systematically supplemented by corrective action plans, which are supervised by a member of the Executive Committee. These Reports, as well  as  subsequent  follow-up  Reports, are the subject of various communications and periodic discussions with the Statutory Auditors,\n- -provides guidance to Group entities, through the Digital Security Department, which reports directly to  the Group Control and  Compliance Department,  on  the  identification and protection of their data, systems, and digital applications (definition of rules, roll-out expertise and advice, control of proper implementation);\n- \u25a0 the Legal Department, which identifies legal risks, issues internal guidelines and Codes, and then oversees their proper implementation. It monitors the development of the main disputes. It manages insurance.\n\nMoreover, the Group has a formal whistleblowing system at all its entities, whereby employees can anonymously alert an independent external service provider of any deviations from the Group Code of Conduct or applicable legislation. Employees can file  this  alert  in  their own language by telephone or through the provider's dedicated website. After consulting the employee representative bodies in France, this system was extended at the end of 2021 to all internal and external stakeholders.\n\nAll  alerts  filed  are  processed  in  a  confidential  manner  under  the supervision of the Group Ethics Officer, in line with the principle that anyone who reports something in good faith will not be sanctioned or have any retaliatory measures taken against them. This principle  of whistleblower protection is guaranteed by the Group and reiterated in the Code of Conduct.\n\nThis system is  an alternative solution to the usual  process for reporting incidents within  the  entities  through  managers  and  the Human Resources teams. It helps to accelerate the processing of reports  received,  and thus  to  minimize  their potential impact  on individuals and the organization. Details of the indicators relating to reports received and alerts are provided in Chapter 5 on page 388.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk management\n\nTo ensure the continued development of its activities, the Group must actively pursue an approach to prevent and manage the risks (especially industrial and financial risks) to which it is exposed.\n\nIn terms of the Group's business activities, industrial risk management must essentially focus on prioritizing safety and security while maintaining a permanent focus on the reliability of facilities.\n\nFinancial risk management requires strict control over investments, combined with prudent and rigorous practices regarding the accounting and financial aspects of the activities.\n\nThe Group's formal risk management approach aims to ensure:\n\n- \u25a0 the regular identification of the different forms of risk (industrial, financial and other) encountered by the Group during  the  pursuit  of  business  activities, which  are assessed according to both potential impact and probability of occurrence;\n- \u25a0 the assessment of the level of maturity of the management of each risk based on a common scale with respect to the quality of policies, organizational structures, processes and controls in place;\n- \u25a0 the progress of the main corrective action plans undertaken to mitigate these risks, by focusing monitoring activities on a limited number of priorities.\n\nThis three-phase risk management process (mapping, maturity level assessment, mitigation plans) covers more than 90% of consolidated Group revenue.\n\nThe Risk Management Department within the Group Control and Compliance Department leads this approach using:\n\n- \u25a0 resources  dedicated by the  hubs,  World  Business  Units and World Business Lines to manage the approach in their respective scopes  of responsibility  (under the  supervision  of the Boards of Directors of the entities concerned) and to provide a summary thereof;\n\n## 3. Internal control\n\nIn addition to the Principles of Action ( which reaffirm the Group's values with particular reference to stakeholders (shareholders, suppliers and customers, employees, etc.),  the Group's  policies,  Codes,  and procedures  are  grouped together  in  a Global Reference  Manual,  the BlueBook, which  is available to employees on the Intranet. The BlueBook constitutes a set of internal control and risk management documents, which must be implemented by each entity included in the Group's consolidated financial statements. https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/ethics/groups-principles-action),\n\n- \u25a0 to certain financial executives, in order to ensure the security of transactions and financial flows.\n\nThe managers  of the  various  Group subsidiaries exercise their duties under the control of the Boards of Directors and in accordance with laws and regulations applicable in the countries where they operate.\n\n- \u25a0 the work of members of the Risk Committee that it coordinates (described on page 92).\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee reviews Group risk management based on presentations covering:\n\n- \u25a0 the progress of the approach (on an annual basis);\n- \u25a0 each  major risk management system  based  on a multi-year program structured according to the challenges;\n- \u25a0 internal audit summaries of these risk management systems.\n\nEnvironmental and societal risks are reviewed by the Environment and Society Committee (three meetings per year), which also meets once a year in a joint session with  the Audit  Committee. During this joint session, the two Committees may review the trajectory of the climate objectives.\n\nIn order to have a broader approach, each year, the Risk Management Department presents a hypothetical identification and positioning of emerging risks at a Risk Committee meeting. A review is also performed on the timing of the emergence of these risks, and the necessary anticipatory actions are suggested. According to the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC), an emerging risk is a new risk or an existing risk that could materialize in  a  new  context  or in  a  context not  yet  known. An emerging risk is potentially impactful but its characteristics are not yet fully identified.\n\nFinally, an annual summary of risk management actions undertaken by the Group is presented to the Board of Directors; each year it validates the Audit and Accounts Committee's provisional program which is presented to it beforehand, as well as a list of subjects of strategic interest or with particular relevance that will be presented in a more specific manner.\n\nThe BlueBook is the cornerstone of the  Group's  internal  control system, which aims to ensure that:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's activities and the conduct of its employees:\n- -comply  with  laws  and regulations, internal standards and applicable best practices,\n- -comply with the objectives defined by the Company, especially in terms of risk prevention and management policies,\n- -contribute to safeguarding the Group's assets;\n- \u25a0 all  financial  and accounting  information  communicated  either internally or externally gives a true and fair view of the situation and activity of the Group and complies with prevailing standards.",

        "page_content": "## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Control environment\n\nGenerally, the Group's internal control system should help better master its activities, the efficiency of its operations and the efficient use  of  its resources.  It  also aims to  prevent  errors and frauds.\n\nAs with other 'assurance systems', it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the Group's objectives will be met.\n\nIn  2022,  the Group  pursued the  actions  undertaken in  previous years, with all material Group entities and shared service platforms (representing over 90% of consolidated Group revenue),  reviewing  the appropriateness  of  their  internal  control system in relation to the Reference Framework for internal control and risk management systems. These entities also implemented actions aimed at improving their control system in terms of annual guidelines defined at the beginning of the year by the hubs and World Business Units, the Group Control and Compliance Department and the Finance Department. The latter two together\n\norganize these improvement measures and report on their progress to the Group's Executive Management then to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nAudits are coordinated by the Group Control and Compliance Department and  the Statutory  Auditors, based on a joint work program, to verify the assessments of the internal control processes and the correct implementation of key operating controls.\n\nFinally, cases of fraud are systematically reported to the Group's Ethics Officer, analyzed together with Internal Control in order to identify measures to strengthen  the  system to be  implemented, and are investigated when deemed necessary. They are regularly brought to the attention of Executive Management, the Ethics and Compliance Committee and the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## RECENT MEASURES AIMED AT STRENGTHENING THE SYSTEM\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued its measures to improve the quality of its internal control and risk management system, with in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 in terms of industrial safety: created in 2020, the Industrial and Safety Committee, chaired by a member of the Executive Committee, meets every two months to better learn from incidents across the Group. This Committee helps strengthen the Group's safety performance and the management of certain industrial risks. Industrial departments from all activities participate in this Committee;\n- \u25a0 in terms of governance:\n- -the Ethics and Compliance Committee monitored the progress of programs covering prevention of corruption, competition law, export control, protection of personal data (GDPR) and the Vigilance  Plan. The Committee  notably reviewed the update of the Code of Conduct and the topics related  to  social  taxonomy  (classification  of  activities  from the perspective of human and social rights, with reference to international standards),\n- -concerning the duty of vigilance, a dedicated responsibility was created in 2020 to oversee the implementation of this approach, in particular by coordinating the  structure and content of the Vigilance Plan to better meet the expectations of the Group's stakeholders;\n- \u25a0 in terms of internal control: under the supervision of the Group Internal Control Department, the Group's internal control manual was updated, and several awareness-raising and training initiatives on internal control issues were held, drawing on the network of Group internal controllers;\n- \u25a0 in terms of digital security and the management of major crises:  the  continuation  of  the project aimed at defining and then rolling out cyber business continuity plans across the Group;\n- \u25a0 in terms of human resources management: with the increasing digitalization of activities, the Air Liquide University offered again two virtual training campuses covering six themes: Management & Leadership, Sales & Marketing,  Operational Excellence,  Innovation, Climate &  Energy Transition  and  HR professionals;\n- \u25a0 in response to the health crisis and the accompanying changes to  organizational  structures,  the continuation of the global 'next normal' project to support this shift in working methods. This tool allows managers to take ownership of this new framework including remote team management, a structured  remote  working policy, the  design  of  workspaces, and an in-depth review of  our  interaction  with  our  customers and patients.\n\n## 4. Financial and accounting information\n\nIn order to guarantee the  quality  and  reliability  of  financial and accounting information produced, the Group primarily relies on a set of accounting principles and standards, as well as a consistent accounting and management reporting system and feeds both the Group statutory consolidation process and the management analysis that is under the responsibility of independent departments, which report to the Finance Department.\n\nThe Group accounting manual, which includes the Group financial policy, defines the accounting rules and principles as well as the consolidation methods applicable and states the formats applicable for reporting financial and accounting information. This manual is regularly updated by the Finance Department with the amendments to IFRS or their interpretations.\n\nManagement and accounting reports are each prepared under the responsibility of independent but interactive departments that follow identical methods and principles:\n\n- \u25a0 this  independence allows for the enhancement of information and analysis through the use of complementary indicators and data, particularly those which are specific to each business;\n\n- \u25a0 the  fact that  these  bodies are interactive provides  for better control of  the reliability  of  information  through  the  systematic and regular reconciliation of data.\n\nThe reports primarily include:\n\n- \u25a0 monthly management reporting, known as the 'Monthly Flash Report', that provides information on revenue  and  the main financial indicators: income statement, cash flow from operating activities,  net debt and  the amount  of  investments authorized and committed;\n- \u25a0 quarterly reporting, known as the 'Management Control Report', which provides details of the primary items of the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement;\n- \u25a0 a quarterly 'variance' analysis  report to  assess the various components of the change in operating income recurring.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This department prepares the consolidated data and works in conjunction with the Operations Control Department, whose duty it  is  to  analyze and comment on the results, identify and explain any differences with respect to forecasts, and update said forecasts. Meetings are organized each month with the heads of hubs and clusters (groups of countries) to clarify these analyses.\n\nAs part of the scope of the monthly Group Performance Steering Committee, a rolling  forecast for the rest of the  current  year  is systematically presented by the Finance Department, in order to identify,  when applicable,  any differences  with respect to yearly targets and take the necessary steps.\n\nThrough  regular controls, the Finance Department ensures the effective application of accounting methods and principles in the\n\nvarious Group entities. The most complex accounting standards, particularly those relating to employee benefits (IAS 19), methods of consolidation  (IFRS 10/11), the classification of  major Large Industries' contracts and methods for recognizing revenue (IFRS 15/16), derivative financial instruments (IAS 32, IFRS 7, IFRS 9) as  well as the  implementation of new standards are subject  to greater support and tighter controls or to direct treatment by the Finance Department.\n\nIt also relies on audits carried out by the Group Control and Compliance Department, with which it has regular contact.\n\nThe Group takes into account climate risks in its closing assumptions and incorporates their potential impact in its financial statements. In particular, climate risks are taken into account when carrying out closing procedures, in particular the analysis of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and amortization, the review of the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, and the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses.\n\nThe quality and reliability of financial and accounting information is also based on high-performance transactional systems (such as Enterprise Resource Planning - ERP), coupled with modern and secure Group consolidation and Business Intelligence tools. These tools enable financial and operational data to be analyzed, made available and displayed to all employees and management.\n\nThe project, which aims to further harmonize ERPs, continues on the basis of the definition of an accounting and financial framework tailored to the various Group businesses.\n\n## 5. Monitoring of control systems\n\nThe Board of Directors exercises its control over Group management based on the various quarterly activity reports it receives from Executive Management and the work of the Audit and Accounts Committee, according to the methods and principles already described (reports, debriefings, etc.) on pages 151 to 154.\n\nGeneral Management exercises its control over risk management, in particular through regular meetings organized around the Chief Executive Officer and monthly meetings of the Group Performance Steering Committee (described in page 42).\n\nIt also relies on existing reports and:\n\n- \u25a0 Executive Committee meetings, with, in particular, debriefings from the Safety and Industrial Systems Department regarding Group  performance  in  terms  of  security  and  the  progress  of current actions;\n\n## THE RISK COMMITTEE\n\nThe purpose of this Committee is to provide support and expertise to the hubs, World Business Units and World Business Lines which must implement and coordinate the risk management approach in their respective scopes of responsibility.\n\nIt brings together the following Corporate functions: Group Control and Compliance, Legal, Finance, Communication, Safety and Industrial Systems, Human Resources and Group Operations Control Departments.\n\nIt  meets  twice  a year  and is chaired by  the Chief  Executive  Officer (CEO),  in  the  presence  of  an  Executive Vice  President  and  the Director of Strategy. The objectives of these meetings are to report on the progress of priority actions to mitigate major risks, to draw up a summary of risk management and to define Group orientations. The Committee also examines certain strategic risks more closely.\n\n- \u25a0 work carried  out  by  the  Finance  Department,  and  the  Group Control and Compliance Department;\n- \u25a0 recommendations made by various Group Committees set up to ensure enhanced management of certain commitments and significant stakes (the role and members of these Committees are described below).\n\nThese control measures are enhanced by the involvement of operational departments and the Executive Committee in the implementation and follow-up of  actions  needed  to  improve  and strengthen the quality of internal controls.",

Property damage and business interruption\n\nGroup property and business interruption are covered by property and casualty insurance policies underwritten in each country in which the Group operates. Almost all of these policies are integrated into an international program.\n\nThese policies, which are generally of the 'All Risks' form, cover fire, lightning, water damage, explosions, vandalism, impact, machinery breakdown, theft and, depending on the country and in limited amounts, natural disasters.\n\nBusiness interruption following a claim for damage is covered by insurance for most production sites under these same policies. The coverage  period  for business  interruption is 6 to 24  months.  Deductible  amounts  are correlated  to  the  activity of the  sites. Insurers conduct regular visits at the main industrial sites for risk prevention purposes.\n\n## 2. Civil liability\n\nIn terms of civil liability, the subsidiaries have local liability policies that cover damage to third parties due to their activities (operational risk) and their products (product risk). The amount insured for each subsidiary in its policy depends notably on the amount of its revenue and on its activities.\n\nIn addition to local policies, the Group has comprehensive coverage for damage to third parties covering all of its activities in the form of umbrella insurance taken out in France, which covers both the Company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe coverage amount underwritten exceeds 500 million euros. Coverage is built on several overlapping insurance lines. Each line has been underwritten for a given amount with several insurers sharing the risk. Beyond the first line, the upper lines pick up the excess risk from the lower lines.\n\n## 3. Captive reinsurance\n\nA portion of  property damage and business  interruption  risk  is kept by the Group via a captive reinsurance company, which also participates among other things in the coverage of the Group's civil liabilities as well as in the coverage of goods transported.\n\nThis captive reinsurance company covers, for the 2022 fiscal year, claims of up to a maximum of 56 million euros with sub-limits per claim adapted to the nature of the claim. Beyond these amounts, risks are transferred to third-party insurers. Their management is entrusted to a captive manager approved by the competent authorities.",

        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\n## OVERVIEW OF THE LAW\n\n## VIGILANCE PLAN\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY GEOGRAPHY\n\nFrench  law  no.  2017-399  dated March 27, 2017, relating  to  the duty of vigilance of parent companies and instructing companies ('Law on the Duty of Vigilance') introduced, in Article L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code, the obligation for parent companies employing more than  5,000  employees in  France or 10,000 employees in France and abroad, to establish and effectively implement a Vigilance Plan. This Plan must include 'reasonable vigilance measures to identify the risks and prevent severe impacts on human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of persons and on the environment' which may result  from  the activities  of the  Group  and  its subsidiaries, and those of suppliers or subcontractors with whom Air Liquide has an established  commercial  relationship. This  obligation  is  based  on five measures:\n\n- \u25a0 risk mapping (identification, analysis, prioritization);\n- \u25a0 procedures to regularly assess the situation of  subsidiaries, suppliers and subcontractors;\n- \u25a0 appropriate actions to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts;\n- \u25a0 an alert mechanism that collects reporting of potential or actual risks;\n- \u25a0 a monitoring scheme to follow up on the measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the requirements of the Law on the Duty of Vigilance by issuing a Vigilance Plan, whose content is shown below, and which presents the various measures implemented for each stake: human rights and fundamental freedoms (paragraph 2), the health and safety of individuals (paragraph 3), and the environment (paragraph 4). As specific measures apply to the management of suppliers and subcontractors, the risks, procedures and measures implemented in this regard are set out in  paragraph 5.  Two  measures, risk mapping (paragraph 1) and the setup of a whistleblowing system  and  alerts'  collection and treatment (paragraph  6),  apply transversally  to all three stakes and  are presented  independently  to facilitate their reading.  The effective implementation report for the year 2022 is integrated into the Vigilance  Plan, in  particular  through  operational illustrations and monitoring indicators.\n\nAir Liquide strives to invent a sustainable future. Through the engagement, innovation capacity and technological know-how of its 67,100 employees in 73 countries (1) , Air Liquide is particularly well positioned to continue its growth trajectory while contributing to respond efficiently to major economic, environmental and societal challenges.\n\nThis Vigilance  Plan applies to  L'Air  Liquide  S.A. and  all Group subsidiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## STEERING AND GOVERNANCE OF THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE\n\nAs an extension to the Group's commitment to subjects relating to the duty of vigilance, Executive Management decided to create in 2020 within the Group Control and Compliance Department a function dedicated to strengthening the coordination of these matters. Today, two people oversee the implementation of Air Liquide's vigilance approach. Their responsibilities notably include coordinating the structure and content of the  Vigilance Plan to better meet the expectations of the Group's stakeholders and to issue recommendations to the various departments involved. Progress is regularly monitored by Executive Management.\n\nThe Procurement, Group Control  and Compliance  (including in particular Ethics, Risk Management, Digital Security and the Duty of Vigilance), Sustainable Development, Legal, Human Resources, and Safety  and Industrial System Departments took part in  monitoring  the actions  and  the drafting  of  this  Vigilance Plan.\n\nThe departments  responsible  for duty of vigilance stakes (e.g. Human Resources,  Safety and Industrial System,  Procurement) have their own internal steering bodies, including operational representatives. These bodies meet regularly to monitor the actions implemented and performance through indicators.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Committee monitors progress regarding the Vigilance Plan. It brings together the Group Control and Compliance, Sustainable Development, Legal and Human Resources Departments as well as a representative of operational functions who is a member of the Group's Executive Committee and meets at least twice a year and more often when required. In 2022, it continued to review the progress of stakes relating to the duty of vigilance.\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee is one of the Board of Directors' special committees dedicated to societal and environmental responsibility issues. This Committee was created in 2017; it includes three members and meets at least three times a year. In 2022, it continued to supervise the roll-out of the Vigilance Plan.\n\n(1)\n\n<!-- image -->",

This commitment is reiterated in the Principles of Action, which were adopted in 2006 and successively revised in 2016 and 2022. These Principles are shared with all employees and are available on the Group's website ( Air Liquide is committed to its customers and patients, Shareholders, employees, local communities, suppliers and business partners. The Group is also committed to environmental protection and sustainable development. https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ ethics/groups-principles-action).\n\nIn order to complement these Principles of Action, the Group has also adopted a Code of Conduct, updated at the end of 2021 and rolled out in the Group's subsidiaries in 2022 using various means of communication (information meetings,  posters, articles,  etc.). The Code of Conduct is available on the Air Liquide website in 28 languages ( The Code's main areas of focus are covered in the following three chapters: https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ ethics).\n\n- \u25a0 'Acting with Care' , which deals with the themes of protection of people  and assets,  such as safety  and security,  equality, diversity and the prevention of harassment, or the protection of personal data;\n- \u25a0 'Acting  with  Integrity and Transparency' which illustrates in  particular  the  expected  behavior in  terms  of  prevention  of corruption, respect for fair competition rules and transparency of information communicated to the public;\n- \u25a0 'Acting Responsibly' which affirms the commitments of the Group and its employees to protect the environment and human rights and about their contribution to the community.\n\nThis Code provides employees with a framework for reflection and tools to adopt the expected behaviors. The whistleblowing system is also presented in  an educational manner and recalls all the protections granted to whistleblowers (paragraph 6).\n\nAn annual online training course dedicated to the Code of Conduct must be followed by all Group employees. Each year, the topics discussed are renewed. For example, in 2022, the module dealt with topics such as equality and diversity, personal data protection, and environmental protection. 98% of employees have completed this training. During the online training, each employee renews their adherence to the Code of Conduct and their commitment to complying with its provisions on an annual basis.\n\n## INITIATIVES IN FAVOR OF THE DUTY OF VIGILANCE\n\nIn line with its growth trajectory, and with performance and sustainability at the core of its strategy, Air Liquide announced on March 23, 2021, strengthened sustainability objectives to ACT for a sustainable future . The Group's commitment is to make a meaningful difference, with a plan based on three dimensions:\n\n- \u25a0 ACTING for a low-carbon society;\n- \u25a0 ACTING for Health;\n- \u25a0 ACTING as a Trusted Partner .\n\nThe new strategic plan ADVANCE for the 2022-2025 period, presented in March 2022, places Sustainable Development at the heart of Air Liquide's strategy and combines financial and extrafinancial performance . The Group's sustainability objectives are included among the four priorities of the strategic plan, affirming its commitment to decarbonize the planet and act for all.\n\nThe sustainability objectives and ADVANCE contribute to the prevention and  mitigation of the risks  identified  in  the mapping (paragraph 1) and are more fully described in this Vigilance Plan (in particular in paragraphs 2.2.3, 2.4.3 and 4.1.3).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY DAY\n\nAs Air Liquide makes progress toward its sustainability ambition, it is of the  utmost importance to ensure  that  employees have  the necessary information and resources to  understand  the Group's objectives announced in 2021 and 2022, progress made towards achieving them, and how they can relate their own activities to the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nTo promote the Group's sustainability objectives, the Sustainable Development Department organized a Sustainability Day on November 15, 2022. During this  internal  event,  employees were invited to one of the two worldwide webinars presenting sustainability actions and initiatives carried out in several countries. In the days that followed, local events were organized in the Group's various geographies.\n\nTo complement the Sustainability Day, the Group launched an internal sustainability  survey in December  2022,  reaching more than 78% of the employees, to measure their interest in Environment,  Societal and  Corporate Governance (ESG)  topics as well as their personal involvement in these subjects. The data collected provides insight into the Group's strengths, for instance employees' belief that sustainability should be a top priority for Air Liquide. In this sense, the survey also reflects opportunities for the Group to improve, notably by providing sufficient information and training on  sustainability  topics.  In 2023, Air Liquide  will launch actions to address employee feedback and increase sustainability-related engagement.\n\nAir Liquide adheres to several initiatives contributing to the duty of vigilance  stakes. The Group has been a signatory of the United Nations  Global  Compact  (UN  Global  Compact)  since 2014. The initiative calls on companies to make a voluntary public commitment to respect its Ten Principles relating to human rights, international labour standards, the environment and the fight against corruption in their strategy and operations. Every year, Air Liquide issues  a Letter  of Commitment, signed by the Group's Chief Executive Officer, as well as a Communication on Progress with  respect to the strategic and operational implementation  of these Ten Principles, which is available on the UN Global Compact website ( Within the Global Compact France local network, Air Liquide participates in the human rights work group which  allows its  members, of all sizes  and from  all sectors,  to share experiences and expertise on the management of human rights risks. https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/ participants/39281).",

        "page_content": "(2)\n\nAir  Liquide  is  also a signatory of the  Responsible  Care \u00ae Global Charter, an initiative of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA, which aims  to  improve global  performance  in  the  chemical industry in terms of health, safety and the protection of the environment. In this respect, an Air Liquide Group employee chairs the Responsible Care Committee of France Chimie since May 2022. The purpose of  this  committee is to engage companies in the chemical sector in concrete and operational initiatives  related  to sustainable development, particularly in the areas of sustainable procurement, well-being at work, energy management and product safety. https://icca-chem.org/wp-content/ uploads/2020/09/Signatories-of-RC-Global-Charter.pdf)\n\nIn addition, the Group joined the association 'Businesses for human rights' ('Entreprises pour les droits de l'Homme', in May 2021. This multisectoral association brings together 26 international companies and provides a forum for reflection and exchange of good practices to better understand and  integrate human  rights  and  duty of  vigilance issues within businesses. https://edh.org/home.php)\n\nAir Liquide also takes part in several initiatives, such as associations or work groups, relating to a specific stake contributing to the duty of vigilance. For instance, the Group is a member of the French Observatory for Sustainable Procurement (ObsAR, https://www.obsar.asso.fr/).\n\nWith respect to the environment and more specifically to climate change, Air Liquide is  involved in several  initiatives  at different levels. The Group is a member of the 'Enterprises for the Environment' association ('EpE', for which it chaired the Climate Change Commission until November 2022 and is a signatory of  the  French  Business Climate Pledge (https://frenchbusinessclimatepledge.fr/en/). Air Liquide also contributed to the  Assessing Low Carbon Transition \u00ae initiative (ACT, with the aim of developing tools to evaluate low-carbon strategies in the chemical sector. Furthermore, in 2019 the Group joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a label created by a coalition of players committed  to  environmental  issues.  Beyond  the  validation of its objective to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 (paragraph 4.1.3, p 118), the Group continues to develop its strategy to reduce Scope 3 emissions. In 2023, Air Liquide will further the indepth analysis of all its Scope 3 emissions categories, thanks to the work carried out within the expert advisory group led by SBTi, of which the Group is a member ( http://www.epe-asso.org/), https://actinitiative.org/) https://sciencebasedtargets.org/ sectors/chemicals).\n\nLastly, through its activities, its engagement and its environmental and societal actions, Air Liquide contributes to certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that the United Nations has set up to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate the Group's contribution, the due diligence measures implemented to mitigate the salient risks identified, described in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, are associated with the corresponding SDGs.\n\n## 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n\nADVANCE  includes the  sustainability objectives  in  Air Liquide's strategy, in particular: the trajectory towards carbon neutrality by 2050, the achievement of a 35% share of women among 'Managers and Professionals'  by  2025  and  a  common basis  of care coverage for 100% of employees by 2025.\n\nFollowing the work initiated in 2021, the risk mapping methodology for the duty of  vigilance across the scope  of the Group's activities has been simplified. The three exercises carried out with various internal stakeholders and on diverse scopes during 2022 contributed to the continued roll-out of the approach. No new salient risks were identified for the Group's activities during the annual review. The table summarizing these risks, presented on p. 99, was enriched with the types of individuals and ecosystems potentially affected.\n\nIn terms of human rights, faced with the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Air Liquide applied the principles of heightened due diligence in order to ensure the safety of its employees and other people who could be impacted in the course of its activities in the two countries, particularly the most vulnerable exposed to risks affecting their health. To promote Inclusion and Diversity, the 'Inspiring Air Liquide Women' project highlights the journey of 120 women from 43 different nationalities in order to encourage women to dare to achieve their professional and personal ambitions and objectives.\n\nAs safety and security are fundamental values of Air Liquide, the paragraph dedicated to these issues has been enriched to reflect the Industrial Management System that constitutes the common framework for safe and reliable operations. Some procedures already implemented,  in  particular  for risk  assessment  (e.g.: for contractors), management of industrial emergencies and security, were specified this year.\n\nAs part of the prevention of environmental risks, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved Air Liquide's objective to reduce its Scopes 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 as compliant with a well below 2\u00b0C trajectory (2) . The Group was the first in its industry to obtain this validation from the SBTi. Aware of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its  Scope  3  greenhouse gas emissions  reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to pledge to have 75% of its 50 largest customers committed  to  carbon  neutrality  by  2025  and 100% by 2035. Air Liquide launched the roll-out of its water management policy published at  the  end of  2021.  In  particular,  a  dedicated  working group has prepared the guidelines and tools required for operations with  high water consumption in areas of  high water stress.  The  Group has also  updated the  technical  standards for the monitoring and control of discharged water.\n\nTo support Air Liquide's ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, Procurement has a key role to play. The Group's Procurement Department has initiated a 'Procure to  Neutrality' climate roadmap based on four pillars: Measure, Engage, Value and Reduce.\n\nFinally, after opening the whistleblowing system up to all Air  Liquide  stakeholders  at  the end of  2021, the  Whistleblowing Policy was updated at the end  of 2022 and  made available  to external stakeholders on the Group's website ( https://www. airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risk mapping - Methodology for the assessment of the Group's operations\n\nSince 2018, Air Liquide has assessed the duty of vigilance risks. The methodology and results of the risk mapping across the scope of the Group's activities are described below. The risk mapping for Air Liquide's suppliers and subcontractors is subject to a specific methodology described in paragraph 5.1. These two mappings are  complementary to the Group's risk management approach, described on page 76. The procedures for identifying risks for Air Liquide and for the duty of vigilance are interconnected insofar as some of the salient risks, those that are the most severe for people or the environment may correspond to material risks for the Group. Thus, in terms of human rights, the risks related to the discrimination of certain categories of people are identified as societal risks for the Group as indicated on page 87 in the presentation of risk factors. Industrial risks for Air Liquide,  described on  page  78, may have  negative  impacts on people, the most salient of which are identified in the duty of vigilance mapping. The environmental risks relating to the risks of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from its activities and the physical impact of weather phenomena due to climate change are identified as having potential negative impacts on both the environment and people, as well  as  the  Group  as  described  on page 86.\n\nIn the second half of 2021, the risk mapping methodology for the duty of  vigilance  across  the scope of  the  Group's  activities  was adjusted  in  order  to  refine  the  identification  of  salient  risks.  The approach is based on principles advocated by international standards such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct.\n\nThe first step consisted in determining a risk universe by identifying the potential negative impacts that Air Liquide's activities could cause to people and the environment. The Duty of Vigilance Department determined this risk universe in collaboration  with  the functions  responsible for  duty  of  vigilance stakes:\n\n- \u25a0 by  referring  to the  internationally  recognized  human  rights in the International Bill of Rights and the International Labour Organization (ILO) fundamental conventions, in particular:\n- -fundamental rights and principles at work: freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, elimination of forced or compulsory labor, abolition of child labor, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment  and  occupation (e.g. women representation, equal pay), a safe and healthy working environment,\n- -other rights at work: work organization, wage and benefits, well-being and quality of life at work (e.g. absence of violence and moral or sexual harassment, transformation of the work environment), respect for privacy, provision of facilities (e.g. dining areas, restrooms, housing),\n- -the rights of local communities: access to natural resources (e.g. water), land acquisition, lease and use (e.g. property rights and free, prior and informed consent), health, safety and security of local communities;\n- \u25a0 by structuring issues related to human rights and fundamental freedoms and the health and safety of people around types of potentially affected individuals: Air Liquide employees, external staff  present  on its  sites  (e.g. employees of subcontractors), local and neighboring communities, customers and their employees, patients, consumers and end-users, Shareholders and lastly, other third parties such as road users; and\n- \u25a0 by giving indications  on  the potential materialization of each risk identified.\n\nThe second step consists of periodically analyzing and prioritizing the risks in order to determine the most salient ones, that is to say the most severe potential negative impacts that Air Liquide's activities could cause to people and to the environment. This assessment is carried out with regard to two analytical prisms: Air Liquide's activities and the countries in which the Group operates. Risks are analyzed on the basis of two criteria to determine their salience:\n\n- \u25a0 the severity, by determining which impacts would be most significant in terms of scale, scope and irremediability;\n- \u25a0 the probability, by assessing the likelihood of the risk materializing.\n\nThe analysis of these two criteria is supplemented by monitoring (e.g. public indicators, external stakeholder assessments) to take into account  possible  aggravating factors  that  may  increase  the risks  in certain  countries or  business sectors. This  assessment also considers the most vulnerable groups of individuals: women, children and young people, local communities including indigenous peoples, migrant workers, people with disabilities, LGBTQ+ people, ethnic, religious or cultural minorities.\n\nThe risk mapping  exercise  for  the duty of vigilance across the scope of the Group's activities is reviewed annually and updated as necessary.\n\nIn early 2022, and following the test  of this approach with the Electronics business line, the Duty of Vigilance Department simplified the risk mapping methodology for the duty of vigilance, in particular the risk universe. On this basis, three new risk mapping exercises for the duty of vigilance were carried out:\n\n- \u25a0 the collaborative approach to identifying salient risks relating to human rights and the health and safety of people initiated with some L'Air Liquide S.A. employee representatives;\n- \u25a0 support for the German entity in carrying out the mapping for the application of the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains;\n- \u25a0 support for the Engineering & Construction World Business Unit in identifying salient risks for its employees in the countries in which it operates.\n\nIn 2022, the review of  the risk mapping  results  for the duty  of vigilance did not reveal any new salient risks. Some salient risks previously identified have been reworded to more accurately reflect the related potential negative impacts.",

Details of the measures applied are presented in paragraph 2.6.\n\n## 2. Human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAir Liquide is committed to respecting and promoting human rights in its operations around the world. The Group strongly believes that all persons should be treated with respect and dignity and that companies should play a role in protecting these fundamental human rights. Air  Liquide  shares  the  principles laid down in the  International Bill of  Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and  Rights  at  Work,  the  United  Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as well as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These promote an ethical and responsible approach by companies in their activities and professional relations, in particular in terms of human rights, by encouraging the implementation of due diligence procedures.\n\nParagraphs 2.1.  to 2.4.  address risks for employees under the responsibility of the Human Resources functions. Under the supervision of the Vice President, Group Human Resources, member of the Executive Committee, the Group Human Resources Department determines the strategy deployed by the operational departments. The Human Resources Management Committee, comprising the Group's largest operational departments, meets six to eight times a year to monitor measures implemented and assess their effectiveness.\n\nParagraph 2.5 deals with the risks related to personal data protection  for  employees,  patients  and  Shareholders  and  details the associated governance. The Data Protection Officer and the Group's Digital Security Department rely on a network of 150 correspondents for the operational implementation of personal data  protection actions.  The Digital  Security  Committee  and  the Ethics and Compliance Committee oversee activities related  to personal data protection.\n\n## 2.1. RISKS RELATED TO LABOR RELATIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir Liquide contributes to economic and social growth in the 73 countries (1) where it operates through its technical, industrial, medical  and economic activities. The Group  therefore identifies the applicable laws and regulations, in particular in terms of working conditions and freedom of association.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regular assessment procedures\n\nOne of  the pillars  of  the Human Resources strategy consists in boosting engagement and employability of the employees to enhance performance. To achieve this, relations with social partners are crucial. They allow for the creation of a positive work environment. In light of local regulations, situation and needs, each Group entity defines, in agreement with the employee representative  bodies,  where they exist,  the work organization that  will  promote  engagement  and performance.  Each  year, the share of employees who have access to a dialogue structure with the management is reported by the entities. Formal dialogue structures (e.g. employee representative bodies), equivalent informal structures, or other forms of direct dialogue with the management of the entity are taken into account in this assessment.\n\n## 2.1.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nAir Liquide is committed to meaningful labor relations in all of its subsidiaries. This comes in different forms according to local regulations.\n\nIn Europe, the European Works Council has 29 employee representatives from 12 countries. It was renewed in 2021 for a term of four years. In 2022, two plenary meetings were held under the chairwomanship of a member of the Executive Committee. An exceptional plenary meeting was organized to inform and consult the Council on the implementation in Europe of the Group's project for the transformation of Human Resources processes and organization and the deployment of a new management tool for Human Resources. In addition, the European Works Council Board, composed of five members elected in a plenary meeting, met  five times  in  2022  to be  informed  on various projects and topics  of  interest  affecting  several European countries.  In  2022, plenary  and  Board  meetings  were  held, some of them remotely and others face-to-face, at key sites such as Lisbon and Krakow.\n\nEvery year, the Chairwoman of the European Works Council issues a report on various topics relating to the Group's businesses.  In  2022,  the following main  points  were presented: the roll-out of the Code of Conduct updated at the end of 2021, the new ADVANCE strategic plan, the Group's annual results and more specifically in Europe, results related to extra-financial performance (e.g. safety, reliability, staff turnover rate, training, diversity).\n\nAs part of the Group's 'Next Normal' project to support the transformation of work  (paragraph 2.3.3), the European Works Council set up a dedicated work group in 2021 to collect feedback and suggestions from employee representatives, as key stakeholders for Europe-specific topics. In 2022, this work led to the drafting of a reference document sharing in particular guidelines for social dialogue in European entities and New Design of Offices attention points.\n\nThe principles of the duty of vigilance, its French and, more broadly, European regulatory stakes, as well as the implementation of  the French requirements with  the  Air Liquide Vigilance Plan, were presented at the second plenary meeting of the European Works Council in 2022. This presentation included the collaborative  approach  to identifying  salient  risks  relating  to human rights and the health and safety of persons initiated with some L'Air Liquide S.A. employee representatives.\n\nIn addition, in 2022, the Duty of Vigilance Department presented Air Liquide's Vigilance Plan to several Social and Economic Committees in France.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN T\u00dcRKIYE, AIR LIQUIDE STRENGTHENS LABOR RELATIONS\n\nIn 2022, in T\u00fcrkiye, the My Voice engagement measurement and monitoring program (paragraphs 2.3.2 and 2.3.3) identified employee expectations in terms of labor relations and communication  as  an opportunity for  action.  Air Liquide  T\u00fcrkiye already organizes an annual town hall meeting in January during which  the  entity's  management  presents the  results of the  past year and shares the priorities for the coming year. During this meeting, employees have the opportunity to address their questions to management. In the last quarter of 2022, other initiatives  were launched  for  roll-out in 2023, including  a  single point of contact (SPOC) for each site program that will complement the usual employee communication channels (managers, HR, etc.). At the end of the year, the mission of the SPOCs  was defined  and  the people who will take  on this role were identified among the leadership team outside the hierarchical line.\n\n## 2.1.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nThe Group ensures that labor  relations  are encouraged and, as part of this, 86% of Group employees had access to a dialogue structure in 2022.\n\n|                                                         | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share of employees with  access to a dialogue structure | 81%    | 82%    | 86%    |\n\n## 2.2. RISKS RELATED TO DISCRIMINATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.2.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir Liquide carries out activities with high technological content in a large number of countries with different cultures. Risks related to  discrimination,  mainly  with regard  to  gender  diversity  (gender disparity, in particular in technical or expert occupations), disability, race, origin, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity or age could affect the Group's employees.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nOne of the  pillars of  the Human Resources strategy consists in building an agile, inclusive and collaborative organization capable of addressing  the challenges of a continuously changing  world. Inclusion and Diversity, sources of strength and drivers of innovation and performance, are among the priorities of the Group's Human Resources strategy and policy. These are a fundamental element of the organization, in terms of both businesses and employees, and drive Air Liquide's long-term performance. Defined at Group level, the Inclusion and Diversity policy is then applied locally in its subsidiaries.\n\nTo assess and manage discrimination-related risks,  Air Liquide rolled  out  in  the past  a  policy  based  on  four  cornerstones: age, gender,  disability and nationality. To cover the  various forms  of diversity and promote a more inclusive culture, Air Liquide changed its policy, striving to fight against any form of discrimination.",

        "page_content": "The Group's objective is to increase diversity among managerial staff to better enhance the many cultures from which Air Liquide employees come and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified gender  equality targets  have  been  set  for the  Group. The local entities carried out an assessment of the current situation to define an objective at the cluster (group of countries) level and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\nAt  the entity level, the  objective  is  to  have teams composed of employees who are  representative  of  the country in  which  they work. Therefore, each entity is responsible for implementing action plans specific to the country and its legal framework regarding various forms of diversity (race, disability, origin, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, etc.).\n\n## 2.2.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nWithin the central Human Resources organization, a team leads Inclusion and Diversity projects. The roadmap promoting Inclusion and Diversity in the Group is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 deploying the diversity objectives in all entities and implementing corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improving the Group's Human Resources processes to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promoting an inclusive culture to leverage teams' diversity.\n\nEach hub and business implements its own roadmap and action plans contributing to Inclusion and Diversity, taking the local context into consideration. As part of this approach, they analyze processes and practices, identify potential biases and implement corrective measures ('nudges') to limit them. Thus, during the regular reviews of talents with high potential, the diversity of profiles is taken into account, with the aim of continuing to increase diversity in the Group's key positions. This serves as a way to promote the many cultures present within the Group, and to strengthen gender equality.\n\nFinally, the promotion of an inclusive culture also contributes to a sustainable approach to diversity. Numerous initiatives are deployed within the Group to this end: events, learning opportunities,  mentoring, networks and communities for different interest groups such as women's careers.\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE CONTINUES THE ORGANIZATION OF A DIVERSITY MONTH\n\nCalled 'Diversity Awareness Month', October 2022 was an opportunity to bring together nearly 1,000 Group employees through six webinars addressing the topics of psychological safety at work, the importance of connectedness, the different cognitive biases affecting objectivity and the different forms of discrimination. In addition, employees involved in the second edition  of  the  Inclusion  Movement were able to share what they learned from the 30 or so pilots carried out in previous months in their  entities  to  introduce  new  inclusive  practices  into  their daily lives.\n\n## Gender equality\n\n## 2025 OBJECTIVES\n\nWhen announcing its sustainability objectives in 2021 and its new strategic plan ADVANCE for the 2022-2025 period in March 2022, Air Liquide affirmed its ambition to act as a trusted partner and for all and its commitment to promoting Inclusion and Diversity. Air Liquide has set two objectives for gender diversity by 2025:\n\n- \u25a0 reach a 35% share of women in the 'Managers and Professionals' population, versus 31.5% (2) currently.\n- \u25a0 reach a 25% share of women in Executive positions, compared to 24.8% currently.\n\nThe Inspiring Air Liquide Women project contributes to Air Liquide's Inclusion and Diversity roadmap. It highlights the paths of women working within the Group from all walks of life, all geographies and all professional backgrounds to inspire other female employees with the aim of encouraging them to dare to achieve their ambition and objectives both personally and professionally. Inspiring Air Liquide Women is a way to celebrate the many female achievements within the Group. These stories of 120 women from 43 different nationalities were published in 2022 on a dedicated website ( to celebrate Air Liquide's 120 th anniversary. https://inspiringwomen.airliquide.com/ about)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAIR LIQUIDE SUBSIDIARIES ENGAGE IN MENTORING AND NETWORK INITIATIVES TO ACHIEVE THEIR GENDER EQUALITY GOALS\n\nThe Industrial Merchant teams of  Air Liquide  Belgium  launched the 'Ladies dinner'  initiative  to  improve  the  attractiveness of Air Liquide  among women engineers. Women engineers are invited to meet female employees of the subsidiary who present the Group's activities to them.\n\nAir Liquide Brazil launched the 'Women in Operation' initiative to welcome recently graduated women to the teams and give them the opportunity to grow. In the medium and long term, this initiative could also increase the proportion of women in the Technical Community Leaders (TCL) program (3) . A mentoring program has also been developed to support this initiative.\n\n## Gender equal pay\n\nIn France, the law of September 5, 2018, known as the Loi avenir professionnel relating to the freedom to choose one's professional future, requires companies with more than 50 employees to implement an annual mechanism for assessing gender pay gaps, the result of which is a public social score for the Company (out of 100 points). The Professional Equality Index and five related indicators must also be made available to the Social and Economic Committee and transmitted to the French administration.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The weighted average Professional Equality Index stands at 90.5/100, maintaining the trend compared to 2020 and 2021. The company L'Air Liquide S.A. published its fifth annual Professional Equality Index, which reached 97/100.\n\nOutside of France, the Group initiated, in 2019, a common process to assess  the gender pay gap by creating an internal index based on the French index but tailored to Air Liquide's global presence. It was first deployed for entities with more than 400 employees for the years 2019 and 2020.\n\nFor the year 2021, the scope of the index has been extended to entities with more than 200 employees and the calculation method was revised. The updates, including the use of the median salary and job grading, are intended to provide a more accurate result.\n\nThis index from the year 2021 onwards is calculated on the basis of the weighting of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 pay gap between women and men, using the  median  salary per job grade;\n- \u25a0 individual wage  increase  gap  between  women and men  per job grade;\n- \u25a0 percentage of employees  having  received  a salary  increase after a maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\nThe 2021 index, calculated in 2022, was 75/100 for a coverage of 74% of the Group's employees.\n\n## Inclusion of disabilities - one of the Group's priorities\n\nTo promote the inclusion of disabilities, Air Liquide intervenes at two levels:\n\n- \u25a0 with its employees, in particular via the HandivAirsity initiative;\n- \u25a0 with its suppliers, by developing relationships with companies which make their employment policies and practices inclusive of people with disabilities (i.e. disability-inclusive companies).\n\nLaunched in 2017 at the European level, the HandivAirsity initiative aims at encouraging diversity by integrating people with disabilities into teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our differences make our performance.' This  slogan  carries  a strong conviction. The inclusion of disabilities is fully in line with the policy to promote Inclusion and Diversity within Air Liquide.\n\nThis desire is not new; it has been embodied since 2007 in successive agreements in France which have advanced the policy of welcoming, maintaining and promoting the professional development of people with disabilities. Air Liquide is committed to finding  solutions to  enable people with disabilities to remain in employment. The following adjustments are planned to accommodate for disabilities in the workplace:\n\n- \u25a0 ergonomic studies and adaptation of the workstation with regard to the capacities of the person;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptation of methods of access to work premises and specific training services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nAir Liquide raises awareness among teams about the inclusion of disabilities  in order to  facilitate the  welcoming and professional integration of workers with disabilities in the company. The French subsidiaries have awareness-raising plans in order to strengthen the level of information for all stakeholders and fight against any prejudices that may  persist. In  2022, a survey was  carried out among employees in a selection of French entities to gain a better understanding of the obstacles to the inclusion of people with disabilities in the teams and thereby determine appropriate actions. The results of this survey will be shared more widely with the European disability coordinators. The French entities participate in particular in DuoDay, a day where they welcome a person with a disability paired with a volunteer professional.\n\nWithin a scope covering around 6,000 employees based in France, a fifth  Disability  agreement  for  a  period of three years (2020-2022) was signed at the end of 2019. The aim of this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment  rate  to  reach  4.2% in  2022  vs. 3.3%  in  2018.  The 2021 rate, calculated in April 2022, is 4.43% (4.35% in 2020). Negotiations with the  labor unions, which began at the  end of 2022, resulted in the signature of a sixth Disability agreement for the 2023-2025 period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN FRANCE, AIR LIQUIDE ORGANIZES A CO-CONSTRUCTION DAY ON DISABILITIES\n\n85% of disabilities occur during the course of a person's life and therefore during their career. In 2022, in addition to the sustained efforts made over the past 15 years to recruit people with disabilities, a co-construction day was held at the end of June to further reflect on the 'recognition' of disability situations and the way they are taken into account. This event gathered 34 participants representing all French entities and all activities (Human Resources managers, disability  inclusion  local leaders, managers, employees, people with disabilities, employee representatives, etc.). The proposals for action discussed and formulated during  this  day  will  help to  respond  as effectively  as possible to the needs for appropriate support for those involved in disability inclusion. These proposals have been particularly inspiring in the negotiations for the sixth Disability Agreement 2023-2025, while strengthening the dialogue between the stakeholders.\n\nMore widely in Europe, other concrete actions were also carried out to change the way disability is seen in operations and accelerate the pace of recruitment: ambassadors campaign, and a working group with managers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, AIR LIQUIDE PROMOTES NEURODIVERSITY\n\nAs part of the  'Read My Mind' initiative, which addresses the questions around mental health and provides support to employees, Air Liquide United Kingdom focuses on raising awareness on Neurodiversity. Two 'Neurodisabilty understood' Lunch&Learn sessions have been organized: one for all employees and one dedicated to line managers in order to discuss how to manage neurodiverse employees and the specificity they could face. Line managers were also invited to a day workshop with  an  external  partner who provided  them with tips to support their own and their team's mental health.",

This sector includes organizations for the social and professional  integration of  people with disabilities (ESAT), selfemployed workers with disabilities (TIH) as well as adapted enterprises (EA).\n\nIn France, Air Liquide declared 1.5 million euros spent with disability-inclusive companies for the year 2021. The social footprint of these purchases represented 71 jobs created or maintained in 2021 (4) .\n\nSince 2018, in France, Air Liquide has organized five annual editions of the 'Business Meeting Inclusive Procurement' bringing together Air Liquide key players and disability-inclusive companies to  promote  procurement to  them.  In 2022, this  event,  co-hosted with the Handeco association, was conducted in a digital and face-to-face format through a round table, presentations and speed-meetings. Nearly 100 Air Liquide employees and 10 suppliers from the disability-inclusive sector took part in this event.\n\n## INCLUSIVE PROCUREMENT, A PATH TO EMPLOYMENT\n\nDuring the 2022 'Business Meeting Inclusive Procurement', The 'Inclusive procurement, a path to employment' round table explored ways of integrating people working in disability-inclusive companies into the traditional business world with adapted assignments and positions. On this occasion, the Campus Technologies Grenoble, the first  pilot  entity  in  the  recruitment  of people with mental disabilities, presented its experience. This ambitious and unprecedented project within the Group was made possible by several factors:\n\n- \u25a0 the long-standing presence of workers, employed by a subcontracting  disability-inclusive  company, within  a  team in the entity;\n- \u25a0 the availability of similar tasks and permanent job positions on the same site to ensure an adapted activity over the long-term;\n- \u25a0 the involvement and flexibility of the team of Air Liquide employees welcoming the workers.\n\nIn addition, for the second year in a row, the Air Liquide Inclusive Procurement European Forum was organized in 2022. During this forum, bringing together nearly 200 participants from operations, procurement as well as suppliers, experiences from France, Spain and the United Kingdom were shared to increase awareness and foster relationships with disability-inclusive companies.\n\nThe definition and understanding of the different forms of discrimination vary depending on the national or local context. The  fight against discrimination must  therefore  be  handled in  a manner fitting with these disparities. This is why actions are also taken locally to adapt the procedures implemented by the entities to fight other forms of discrimination.\n\nThe Human Resources Department of Air Liquide U.S., with the help of the BRGs, has created a 'Diversity & Inclusion Learning On Demand Toolkit' offering resources to employees to improve their knowledge about Diversity & Inclusion. This initiative supports  efforts to  improve behaviors and work methods  that promote a culture of inclusion. This toolkit contains topics, in a variety  of  formats,  classified by level of knowledge and target audience, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 Inclusion and Belonging;\n- \u25a0 Allyship and Equality;\n- \u25a0 Gender Identity;\n- \u25a0 Courageous Conversations;\n- \u25a0 Walk in my shoes.\n\n## IN THE UNITED STATES, AIR LIQUIDE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE INCLUSION OF LGBTQ+ PEOPLE\n\nIn  2022, Air  Liquide  U.S.  received for the third consecutive year the 'Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality' distinction awarded by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which rewards companies that implement policies and procedures that promote equality  of  LGBTQ+ people at work. The Group is committed to ensuring the well-being of all its employees and will therefore continue, like American employees, to promote a culture of Inclusion and Diversity.\n\n## 2.2.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nIn terms of gender equality, Air Liquide has created its own procedure to define its reporting methods for Human Resources. This procedure includes all of the definitions, measurement procedures and collection methods for this information. Each month, the subsidiaries update the indicators in the Group's reporting tool.\n\n## Gender equality\n\n|                                                          | 2025  objectives   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share of women  among 'Managers  and Professionals'  (a) | 35%                | 30%    | 31%    | 31.5%  |\n| Share of women in  Executive positions                   | 25%                | 21%    | 24%    | 24.8%  |\n\n- (a) The share of women among \"Managers and Professionals\" is rounded off in increments of 0.5%.\n\nIn the United States, in order to develop a more inclusive culture, communities in networks called 'Business Resource Groups' (BRG) have been created to promote diversity, in particular  with  regards  to  women, veterans, African-Americans, LGBTQ+, Hispanic and Asian Americans.\n\nFighting other forms of discrimination\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decrease in the result, observed in 2022, is linked in particular to the expansion  of the  index scope  to  include entities  with more than 200 employees, thus integrating countries with greater social disparities. An action plan has been rolled out in light of this index:\n\n- \u25a0 part of the 'Merit Increase' budget was allocated to filling gender pay gaps;\n- \u25a0 awareness workshops on the index criteria were organized for the HR functions.\n\n## 2.3. RISKS RELATED TO THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WORK ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nThe work environment is characterized by the accelerated evolution of society and the economy, with digitization, rapid technological development and new business models. An intense workload can create psychosocial risks such as stress, work-life imbalance and thus affect the well-being, health and level of engagement of Group employees.\n\n## 2.3.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nEmployee engagement is one of the Human Resources' priorities. Air Liquide has launched a program called My Voice to measure and monitor employees' engagement . It aims to improve employee experience and well-being. It is based on a simple concept: listen,  understand  and  act.  Following the  launch  of  the initiative  in  Asia Pacific  in  2019,  feedback is gathered annually from employees across the Group to obtain a better understanding of their expectations and to identify and roll out appropriate measures -and,  as a result, significantly increase their engagement.\n\nA short survey covering some 20 topics is sent to each employee with room to leave comments if desired. The questions cover areas such as safety, work-life balance, career development, inclusion, empowerment, career development and manager trust. Answers are  completely  anonymous  and  confidential to ensure that  employees are free to express their thoughts. Results  are collected in real-time, aggregated and  analyzed  by  means  of  a shared system for the entire Group. Each manager has access to the results from their team - provided that the thresholds needed to guarantee confidentiality are respected.\n\n## 2.3.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nThe Group ensures that it builds a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative work environment while also safeguarding the health and well-being of employees in their workplace.\n\nFocus groups have been set up aiming at promoting the work-life balance of employees to strengthen their well-being at work. This work resulted in the adoption of principles co-constructed with the European social partners. In 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose  is to  prevent  psychosocial risks. This initiative led to the drawing up of a charter based on principles of action relating to improvement of organization, workload and the work-life balance of employees. The content of this charter facilitated the signing of company agreements with social partners in order to offer new services to employees. In several European countries, agreements have been concluded to meet specific needs and support the transition toward new working conditions, in  particular  on the right to disconnect  and remote  working.  In addition, certain entities, such as  Air Liquide Belgium and Air Liquide Advanced Technologies, have included in this type of agreement the 'Friday afternoon no meetings' initiative, which allows employees to have time available for tasks requiring concentration.\n\nMore generally, within the context of changes to the Group's organizational models, which were  accelerated by the  covid-19 pandemic, Air  Liquide launched a global  project  in  2020  called 'Next Normal' to support this shift in working methods.\n\nWith this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new working framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a structured remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 a framework for rethinking customer and patient interactions;\n- \u25a0 a new framework for a responsible travel policy at Air Liquide.\n\nTo facilitate the deployment of the project, Air Liquide developed a reference  guide  in  2021.  First shared  with  managers,  the guide helps  the entities to  set  up  new  working  methods  based  on  the first global  experiences. Work  groups were  then  organized with employees in the entities to validate the commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE ENTITIES IMPLEMENT THE 'NEXT NORMAL' PROJECT\n\nIn  2022, Air  Liquide  Bulgaria  launched a complete renovation of its offices in order to adapt to new ways of working. The environment aims to be more collaborative and promote teamwork.\n\nAir Liquide Brazil launched the 'One Company' project, which aims to provide offices aligned with the  principles of  the 'Next Normal' project (collaboration,  technology and innovation, wellbeing  and flexibility)  for  its  employees in  order  to  improve their experience.",

Paying  close  attention to  the employee  experience is  a key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees.\n\nEach year, following the collection of feedback and precise analysis of the results, targeted actions are launched at different levels in the organization: with managers and their employees to improve team dynamics, at the level of the entities by management teams and at the Group level. At this last level, the results of the program allowed the Group to:\n\n- \u25a0 implement initiatives to improve communication and education on the way compensation packages are set up;\n- \u25a0 strengthen the sharing of information concerning the Group's major strategic orientations with all employees, which has notably been reflected in the communication about ADVANCE, the new strategic plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition  to the 'BeActEngage' model, rolled out across the Group in 2020 and enabling employees to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver long-term performance, the Engineering & Construction World Business Unit launched the 'Quality of Life at Work' initiative. This initiative aims to promote work-life balance while creating a flexible work environment. In addition, it aims at encouraging employees to be proactive in their well-being at work by providing advice that they can easily implement. Lastly, a mental health support scheme (The F\u00fcrstenberg Institut) was opened to employees. It provides access  to  consultations on employees' personal  or professional issues.\n\n## 2.3.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\n|                              | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Response rate for the annual |        |        |        |\n| My Voice survey              | 80%    | 83%    | 77%    |\n\nSince its launch, the My Voice program has confirmed Air Liquide's strengths which contribute to employee engagement and identified opportunities in order to provide appropriate responses as soon as possible (paragraph 2.3.3). The results of the survey  also  confirmed  the overall  satisfaction of  employees with the support provided by the Group during the covid-19 health crisis.\n\n## 2.4. RISKS RELATED TO DISPARITIES IN CARE COVERAGE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.4.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nWhile all Air Liquide employees have care coverage in accordance  with local  regulations,  disparities  between  countries could create inequitable situations within the Group. Furthermore, local standards may not, in some cases, be sufficient to provide employees with adequate and fair social protection.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nThese risks are linked to Air Liquide's presence in 73 countries (5) with a variety of social protection systems .\n\nIn 2020,  a project was launched within the  Human  Resources Department to organize a survey among its correspondents in all the entities. The resulting form containing about 10 questions was designed to better understand the level of care coverage existing in the entities.\n\nIn 2021, an in-depth assessment was performed in addition to the survey to:\n\n- \u25a0 map the existing social benefits;\n- \u25a0 identify the contrasting situations between countries;\n- \u25a0 assess the deviations from market standards and thus define a common basis of care coverage to best meet the concerns of employees.\n\nFollowing this assessment, Air Liquide decided to offer a common basis of care coverage to employees. This commitment is described in the following paragraph.\n\n## 2.4.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\n## 2025 OBJECTIVE\n\nWhen announcing its sustainability objectives in 2021 and its new strategic plan ADVANCE for the 2022-2025 period in March 2022, Air Liquide affirmed its ambition to act as a trusted partner and for all and its commitment to offer a common basis of care coverage for 100% of employees by 2025. This care coverage will guarantee:\n\n- \u25a0 a life insurance policy with an indemnity equivalent to a year's salary;\n- \u25a0 a health coverage that includes inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, entities were grouped by country so that gaps in their current coverage could be assessed and a plan devised to phase in upgrades by 2025.\n\nA special team was set up within the Human Resources department to oversee the plan's roll-out  and  measure  progress within  the  Group  on  an  annual  basis.  In  addition,  in  2022,  each hub drew up a 2023-2025 roadmap to achieve the objective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

RISKS RELATED TO THE VIOLATION OF PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION\n\n## 2.5.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nPersonal data can be used dishonestly in order to violate the privacy, rights and property of individuals, or for the purposes of discrimination. The people most likely to be exposed to these risks  in the  context of  Air  Liquide's activities  are the  1.9 million home healthcare patients treated by Air Liquide, the nearly 750,000 individual Shareholders and the 67,100 Group employees.\n\n## 2.5.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe level of risk of violation of the privacy of individuals varies according to  the nature, sensitivity  and scope of personal  data entrusted to and necessary to Air Liquide in the course of its activities.\n\nOperating entities describe the personal data they own or use and the appropriate protection measures. The assessment of this risk and the corresponding security measures are validated during the creation of or implementation of major changes to the processing of personal data (in particular when revising the operational processes or IT tools supporting them).\n\nThe points assessed include in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 the nature of the personal data (for example patient  health data, asset and financial data of Shareholders, family or financial data of employees);\n- \u25a0 the purposes of the processing of personal data;\n- \u25a0 the functions that process personal data within Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 third parties to whom personal data may be entrusted or transferred outside the Group;\n- \u25a0 the  possible transfer of personal data outside  the European Union.\n\nThis information as well as the protective measures are grouped together in the record of personal data processing activities.\n\n## 2.5.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nIn May 2018, Air Liquide adopted and had the European data protection authorities approve Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) which embody the Group's commitment to the protection of personal data. Considering European regulations to be among the most protective in the world, Air Liquide, through the BCR, provides the same level of protection in all of its operating entities.\n\nThe BCR provide for:\n\n- \u25a0 the adoption of a personal data protection policy accessible to all on the Group's website ( ); https://www.airliquide.com/sites/ airliquide.com/files/2018/05/23/air\\_liquide\\_bcr\\_global\\_privacy\\_ policy.pdf\n- \u25a0 the appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who relies on  a network  of  more than  150 regional  or  local Information Protection Coordinators (IPC) distributed throughout the Group (by hub, cluster (group of countries), activity or operating entity) to steer and coordinate actions to protect personal data;\n- \u25a0 the signing of contracts between L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries which formalize the commitment of the subsidiaries to the BCR;\n- \u25a0 and the deployment of tools such as:\n- -records of personal data processing activities,\n- -initial employee training and refresher courses on the Code of Conduct given every two years, which took place in 2022,\n- -taking into account the protection of personal data by default and from the design stage of the processing,\n- -risk analyses regarding the protection of personal data,\n- -various means  available to  contact  the DPO and  IPC  to allow internal or external natural persons to make a request to exercise their rights as specified in the Group's personal data protection policy (Rule n\u00b06) or to report any personal data protection violations.\n\nPersonal data processing identified as having the greatest impact on people (for example, processing of patients' personal data) is reviewed annually by internal experts.\n\nIn addition, the update of the Group's Code of Conduct, rolled out in 2022, includes a section devoted to the protection of personal data.\n\n## 2.5.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nSince May 2018, regular processes have been measuring the volume  of requests  to exercise rights  and  of  possible personal data violations and the contractual adherence of Group entities to the Binding Corporate Rules (BCR). The system for recording requests to exercise rights and reporting any violation of personal data is presented in paragraph 6 dedicated to the whistleblowing system.\n\nIn  order  to measure the level of maturity of  the Group's entities with regard to the protection of personal data, a self-assessment questionnaire is gradually being rolled out within the Group. Most European entities started this process in 2021. It was extended to the remaining European entities and IT, R&D and Engineering & Construction activities in 2022. The roll out will end in 2023 with the Americas, Asia Pacific, and Middle East and Africa hubs.",

SITUATION FACED WITH THE MILITARY CONFLICT BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE\n\nFaced with the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Air Liquide has applied the principles of heightened human rights due diligence in conflict-affected contexts.\n\nThe priority objective was to guarantee the safety of its employees and other people who could be impacted by Air Liquide's  activities in  Ukraine and Russia,  and  particularly  the most vulnerable exposed to risks that may impact their health . The approach involved several components:\n\n- \u25a0 the assessment of the context in which Air Liquide's activities were operated locally;\n- \u25a0 the identification of potential negative impacts on people and the environment  in  the context of (i) maintaining  certain  Air Liquide activities in Russia in the context of international sanctions, or, alternatively, (ii) the Group's withdrawal from its operations in Russia;\n- \u25a0 the implementation of appropriate actions to mitigate identified potential or occurring impacts.\n\nThis approach was implemented as part of a coordinated organization at two levels, within a Group 'strategic' unit and an 'operational' unit at the  level of the  cluster  (group of countries) supervising  activities in  these  geographies. The  actions  focused on the following salient risks before the loss of control over Russian entities on September 1 st , 2022:\n\n- \u25a0 the priority concerned employee safety . Before the start of the conflict, Air Liquide's presence in Ukraine was limited to commercial representation and engineering services for the Engineering & Construction World Business Unit. Although the local activity is at a standstill, the Group has reorganized the work of its  14  Ukrainian  employees  towards  projects outside the country thanks to the use of digital tools. Information on the development of the  situation  was  regularly  communicated  by their management and by the Hub Security Officer in Europe to directly exposed employees, as well as to the entire Group. External listening and telephone support systems were set up to provide psychological support to employees who so wished, both in Ukraine and in Russia. Despite the banking restrictions, employees located in Russia, nearly 720, continued to receive their salaries. Appropriate measures have been taken to allow non-Russian employees to leave the country if they so wish;\n- \u25a0 the Group rigorously applies international sanctions against Russia  and continued  to deliver  medical  oxygen  to  hospitals so as not to affect the health of people that are dependent on it;\n- \u25a0 given the extremely complex situation the Group had to face, following the immediate decision to suspend all foreign investments in Russia and projects underway, on September 2, 2022, the Group announced its intention to withdraw from its operations in Russia.  A memorandum of understanding was signed with  the local management  team with the aim of transferring its activities in Russia as part of a Management Buy Out. The completion of this project remains subject to the approval of the Russian authorities. The Group's activities in Russia are no longer consolidated since September 1, 2022. In order to avoid penalizing employees , the elements related to the terms and conditions of employment were taken into account as part of the project to transfer the activities.\n\nThis sudden  event has  led  the various  teams  involved to draw lessons from the experience so that additional measures can be integrated into certain operational processes in other geographies, to take into account the risks of severe impacts on people in the context of political or armed conflicts.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Health and Safety/Security\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSafety and security are fundamental values for the Group and the 'zero accidents, on  every  site,  in  every region, in every  entity' ambition remains a key priority. The Group, as a responsible industry player, is therefore committed to efficiently and under all circumstances reducing the exposure of its employees, subcontractors, customers, patients and suppliers to professional and industrial risks. This ambition was reaffirmed when the strengthened sustainable development objectives were announced in March 2021.\n\nSafety and security refer to the measures and practices implemented to preserve the life, health and physical integrity of individuals. Safety is achieved by controlling process, road, occupational and product risks. Security is achieved by protecting sites and operations, notably against malicious acts, and by controlling the travel process\n\nThe  safety results  for the  past  30-plus  years illustrate  the  longterm effectiveness of the Group's actions in this area.\n\n## 3.1. A FRAMEWORK FOR SAFE AND RELIABLE OPERATIONS\n\nIndustrial risks are linked to the various industrial products, processes  and  distribution  methods implemented by the  Group. They are distributed over a large number of local production sites.\n\nTo assess and manage these risks, the Group has an Industrial Management System (IMS), which operates based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the accountability of the departments of the various Group entities for the implementation of this system;\n- \u25a0 the  issue  of  key  management  and  organizational  procedures that aim to ensure:\n- -compliance with standards and regulations,\n- -competence management (training, qualifications if necessary, and more),\n- -process risk management,\n- -occupational health, safety and environmental management,\n- -road safety management,\n- -industrial emergency management,\n- -management of change,\n- -management of maintenance,\n- -control of products and services from providers,\n- -management of installation projects,\n- -management of product development,\n- -management of production and service provision,\n- -incident reporting and investigation,\n- -management of industrial audits,\n- -integration of shared technical standards within the Group entities.\n\nThe  IMS is  fueled by years  of  experience  and designed with  a constant concern for the safety of the Group's employees, subcontractors, customers, patients, suppliers and the communities in which Air Liquide operates.\n\nThe IMS document library aims to document the Group's knowledge and requirements to ensure the safe and reliable operation of its industrial processes. It is  continuously updated and enriched.\n\nAs the Group's businesses grow, the level of requirements of its customers increases and Air Liquide's commitment to societal responsibility  is  strengthened,  new  challenges and  opportunities arise.  Thus,  building  on the  experience acquired,  a  project  was carried out to adapt the IMS. While maintaining the strong fundamentals established since 2005, the framework was simplified, roles and responsibilities made clearer and governance strengthened, making the IMS easier to apply to daily operations and therefore even more effective.\n\nThe Safety and Industrial System Department and the Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines, under the supervision of  a  member of the Executive Committee, supervise and control the implementation of the IMS, by notably relying on:\n\n- \u25a0 various dashboards designed to monitor performance in terms of safety;\n- \u25a0 process audits to verify the implementation conditions and compliance of operations with IMS requirements;\n- \u25a0 thorough safety reviews prior to the start-up of any new production unit to prevent any accidents due to a construction defect;\n- \u25a0 technical  audits  to  ensure the  compliance  of  operations  with Group rules.\n\nA regular assessment of industrial risks that may affect individuals covers  all Group activities  in  all geographies.  The  frequency  of these assessments is adapted to each subject: for example, monthly safety performance reviews or an annual review of technical audits. Other topics require evaluations at ad hoc intervals, such as for the covid-19 pandemic, where after several months of very frequent monitoring in 2020 and 2021, the frequency of monitoring meetings was reduced, thus being consistent with the evolution of the health context, which has become less critical.\n\nThe Industrial Management System, IMS, institutionalizes the methodical 'Plan - Do - Check - Act' approach which is essential for process safety.\n\nThe efforts made to carry out risk assessments are bearing fruit and the lessons learned from incidents are being used to strengthen the safety barriers of the installations, thus preventing the recurrence of incidents.\n\nSubsidiaries regularly report all safety and security events in the Group's reporting tool. This tool was replaced at the beginning of 2021 to improve both the quality of the information reported and the monitoring of corrective action plans.\n\nEach month, every event reported is reviewed by a team of experts. The most serious events are analyzed in detail and lessons learned are shared with Group entities that could be potentially affected by similar situations.\n\nThe Industrial and Safety Committee is composed of the heads of the five Industrial Departments of the World Business Lines, the Group Head of Safety, as well as a representative of the Engineering &  Construction  and Global Markets  & Technologies World  Business  Units. Its  purpose  is  to  examine  industrial risks and safety  performance,  as  well  as monitor  the  progress  of  the main  improvement measures, in particular those  relating to the greatest  risks and/or  cross-divisional  measures.  The  Committee meets six to eight times a year and is chaired by a member of the Group's Executive Committee.",

RISKS RELATED TO WORKER SAFETY\n\n## 3.2.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nOver and above the usual risks inherent in all industrial activities, Air Liquide's businesses entail more specific risks that may affect individuals. Industrial processes notably expose  employees and subcontractors to the corresponding risks, which are described in paragraph 3.3. Road transport, a major activity for transporting products to customers, results in the exposure of drivers (employees or subcontractors) and third parties to the risk of road accidents described in paragraph 3.4.\n\nIn addition, industrial sites use numerous  motorized  lifting  gear which present specific risks in connection with handling (collision, falling packages, etc.). Training and qualification are thus required to operate them.\n\n## 3.2.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nJob Hazard Analysis ensures  a safe  workplace  for all,  with the implementation of prevention measures adapted to the configuration of the work environment and the needs of employees. Thus, each job was subject to risk analysis in accordance with the following steps:\n\n- \u25a0 identification of risks related to the tasks to be performed;\n- \u25a0 assessment of their severity and the probability of occurrence;\n- \u25a0 identification of critical points; and finally,\n- \u25a0 identification and implementation of prevention measures.\n\nWork habits, poor postures, access routes, etc. are also taken into account in these analyses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the course of its activities, Air Liquide may use subcontractors. In this event, the Group ensures that the level of safety requirements and rigor applicable to subcontractors is equivalent to that expected of the Group's employees. To this end, the Group includes a description of its security requirements in the contracts it signs with subcontractors. New suppliers are subject to a technical assessment covering, in particular, safety and reliability issues.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nAir Liquide relies on continuous actions to raise the awareness of its teams through specific training related  to  the  knowledge  and the mitigation of industrial risks that may affect individuals. Each employee working on an industrial site receives training and qualification courses specific to their job and is equipped with personal protective equipment allowing them to perform their tasks in the  best conditions.  Collective protective equipment is also installed in the various workshops, if necessary.\n\nSafety  is  a  collective commitment and  everyone's  responsibility. Since their creation in 2013, Air Liquide is committed to ensuring that its Life-Saving Rules are complied with at each site and at all times. Each individual working for Air Liquide, whether employee or subcontractor, is expected to know the rules, follow the rules  and always  intervene  if there  is  a  potential for  unsafe behavior  or conditions.  The  interpretation and  meaning of each rule  is  widely  shared within  the  Group and  with  subcontractors. The Safety and Industrial System Department provides entities with various communication, awareness-raising and training materials on Life-Saving Rules. Non-compliance with these rules is a serious act which may lead to appropriate disciplinary measures. The Life-Saving Rules are as follows:\n\n- 1. I do not work under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.\n- 2. I do not smoke outside designated smoking areas.\n- 3. I wear the Personal Protective Equipment required for the job.\n- 4. I wear an ambient gas detector when required.\n- 5. I never enter a confined space without authorization.\n- 6. I work with a valid Safe Work Permit.\n- 7. I apply isolation procedures before working on potentially energized systems.\n- 8. I do not disable an Element Important for Safety (EIS) without authorization and compensatory measures.\n- 9. I wear fall-prevention equipment when working at heights.\n- 10. I do not walk under suspended loads.\n- 11. I secure the load on vehicles.\n- 12. I always wear a seat belt when I am in a moving vehicle.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This 2022 edition was devoted to the theme 'Care for others' and  highlighted several initiatives  rolled  out by European  entities to strengthen  the safety culture among  customers and  patients, subcontractors and employees.\n\nWhen the Group uses subcontractors as part of its activities, the contracts include safety clauses and the Group communicates to the subcontractors  the safety  values,  standards  and regulations in  force  that must  be respected. Safety instructions are widely shared, understandable and detailed in the organization of work with subcontractors, who are supervised during the execution of services. Finally, Air Liquide assesses the safety performance of subcontractors once the task has been completed and encourages sharing in the form of feedback.\n\n## ENGINEERING & CONSTRUCTION LISTENS TO THE VOICE OF ITS CONTRACTORS IN CHINA\n\nTo better  identify  ways  to  improve  subcontractor safety,  the  Engineering  &  Construction  World  Business  Unit  decided  to  listen  to  the 'Voice of the front line contracted workers'. A questionnaire on key safety culture aspects has been designed and shared anonymously with more than 350 workers, from a sample of three construction sites in China, covering 75% of the front line population. This survey highlighted several key points of attention:\n\n- \u25a0 The construction site environment and working conditions have a significant impact on the safety perception. These conditions can be anticipated from the initial phase of the project.\n- \u25a0 Subcontractor field supervisors need to be role models, following the rules and valuing workers' contributions to safety.\n- \u25a0 Workers focus on their own safety to the detriment of collective behavior.\n\nTo  address these  issues,  E&C's  safety training  materials  for  subcontractors are being revised  to better  address behavioral  aspects (collective/individual), as well as the safety roles and responsibilities of site front line managers. The survey will be extended to sites in Europe as well.\n\n## 3.2.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nThe lost-time accident frequency rate is one of the safety performance review indicators. As illustrated in the chart below, this frequency rate has steadily improved over the years for Air Liquide employees and subcontractors.\n\n## LOST-TIME ACCIDENT FREQUENCY RATE OF AIR LIQUIDE EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACTORS (a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLost-time accident frequency rate of Air Liquide employees and temporary workers\n\nLost-time accident frequency rate of subcontractors\n\n- (a) Number of accidents with at least one day's absence per million hours worked.\n\nThe lost-time accident frequency rate of Air Liquide employees decreased to 0.9 at the end of 2022, compared to 1.1 at the end of 2021. Continued implementation of awareness-raising and prevention actions will  further improve  safety and significantly and sustainably reduce this lost-time accident frequency rate.\n\nThe Group has made and will continue to make every effort to analyze the accidents that have occurred in order to learn from them and thus prevent them from happening again. The evolution of this frequency rate highlights the steady progress in the maturity of teams on the subject of safety as the well as the development of a safety culture within the Group.",

        "page_content": "With regard to subcontractors,  over  the  long term,  the  lost-time accident frequency rate has improved. However, efforts still need to be made to reduce the number of accidents for subcontracted operators and drivers and thus achieve the same level of safety performance for subcontractors as for Air Liquide employees.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  aware  that managing risks for  subcontractors  is  a challenge: the subcontractor management process includes several phases involving different stakeholders and their 'market profile' may create unfavorable conditions (e.g. a high driver turnover rate, a limited choice of subcontractors, a weak local safety culture). In order to improve the safety performance of its subcontractors, Air  Liquide identified the  main  areas  of  work in 2020 (types  of contracts,  business  lines, geographies,  etc.) and best practices (internally and thanks to external benchmarks) and improvement actions are gradually being implemented (paragraph 3.2.3).\n\n## 3.3. RISKS RELATED TO PROCESS SAFETY\n\n## 3.3.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nIndustrial risks must be factored in at the design phase of future installations. During the  construction  phase,  the lack of a  strict accident prevention framework would affect the coordination among the various stakeholders and expose  teams to risks of accidents.\n\nBased on the risk prevention work carried out by Air Liquide for many years, the salient risks related to industrial processes are:\n\n- \u25a0 exposure to hazardous energy sources, fluids and emissions, such as electricity, pressure, steam, hot water, high or very low temperatures;\n- \u25a0 fires resulting in particular from flammable products and materials or electrical installations; and\n- \u25a0 exposure of people to dust and hazardous chemicals through inhalation, ingestion or skin contact.\n\n## 3.3.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nLike all production (primary production and packaging), distribution and research activities, the Group and its subcontractors are exposed to risks related to process safety.\n\nRisks related to process safety are analyzed using various methods, in particular the HAZOP (HAZard and OPerability analysis) methodology. A multidisciplinary team contributes to the comprehensiveness of the identification of credible scenarios that could lead to a critical situation, taking into account the unwanted events identified through the analyses of process and HSE (Health Safety Environment) risks. On this basis, each Group subsidiary is required to implement measures to prevent the risks identified at each of its industrial sites.\n\nIn addition to generic risks, each subsidiary, under the supervision of its Managing Director, regularly identifies specific risks related to its production and packaging activities. The objective is to identify the hazards globally and for each facility, in order to assess the risks and implement the necessary preventive measures.\n\n## 3.3.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nProcess safety is a complex issue as, although rare, incidents can lead to very serious consequences with multiple fatalities. In order to ensure that operations efficiently take this risk into account, Air Liquide has introduced specific action plans, the purpose of which is to control the most severe risks relating to industrial processes. They have been assigned the necessary resources (expertise and budgets) and follow a roadmap.\n\n## Management of industrial emergencies\n\nIn the  event  of  an emergency, the  primary responsibility of the entity's  Managing  Director is  to  analyze its nature, assess both the severity of the situation and the potential impacts on the basis of the risks previously identified, and take all necessary measures to ensure  the safety of people.  A  24/7  on-call  system receives emergency calls and contacts the people responsible for setting up an appropriate response at local level.\n\nA business  continuity  plan  adapted  to  each  entity  describes  the previously defined sequence of actions that will allow the continuation or restoration of operational functions, IT resources, networks and facilities in the event of an unexpected disruption to the service. The aim of this plan is to protect people and property and to limit the impact of the disruption on the entity's activities.\n\nExercises are regularly carried out on a variety of scenarios, and the results  and  lessons  learned  are  documented, thus informing the business continuity plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAIR LIQUIDE FAR EASTERN (ALFE) PARTICIPATES IN AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE EXERCISE IN TAIWAN ISLAND\n\nTo ensure the safety of industrial operations and neighboring communities, the Nanzih Industrial Technology Park (NTIP) in Kaohsiung, Taiwan Island, organizes an annual Emergency Response  Drill in which the  subsidiary  Air  Liquide  Far Eastern (ALFE) participates. In 2022, the drill  scenario chosen  was the simulation  of  an earthquake causing  toxic chemical  substances leakage and fires in the area. 12 response units from government entities and companies combined their efforts at regional level to mitigate the consequences of the simulated natural disaster. During this exercise, ALFE successfully responded to this scenario of industrial  gas  leaks  caused by a strong earthquake and also displayed the use of the ERCV (Emergency Response Containment Vessel), a special response equipment. This drill highlighted ALFE's expertise, which is based on a comprehensive incident reporting system, effective organizational capabilities and professional  on-site  handling.  This  demonstration  enabled it  not only to gain the trust of customers, but also to prove its sustainable operation capability in the NTIP.\n\n## 3.3.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nAs with worker safety, the subsidiaries regularly report all events related to process safety in the Group's reporting tool. Each month, every event reported is  reviewed  by  a  team  of  industrial processes experts. The most serious events are analyzed in detail, presented to the Industrial and Safety Committee (paragraph 3.1), and lessons learned are shared with Group entities that could be potentially affected by similar situations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

RISKS RELATED TO ROAD SAFETY\n\n## 3.4.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir Liquide delivers products to its customers and patients by road in  73  countries (1) .  Each year,  delivery vehicles, sales  staff and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Noncompliance with traffic regulations or the lack of regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents.\n\n## 3.4.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nAir Liquide relies on a structured program to mitigate risks on the road. This program was strengthened in 2020 by the update of the internal requirements standard. Operations are assessed and audited regularly to ensure compliance with this standard.\n\n## 3.4.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nThe road safety program is based on several mitigation and prevention actions, the main ones being:\n\n- \u25a0 equipping vehicles with technologies to assist drivers, to warn them in the event of danger or to protect them in the event of an accident. This is a rapidly changing field and Air Liquide is committed to providing  the best technologies possible to its own fleet of vehicles, as well as those of transport professionals working on its behalf. Around half of the vehicles are already equipped, and the aim is to reach 80% in the coming years;\n- \u25a0 regularly raising awareness among professional and occasional drivers on safe behavior on the road;\n- \u25a0 developing the role of master drivers (in driving  and  loading/ unloading  operations)  who  mentor  new drivers and  serve  as role models within their organization. Identified on the basis of technical  criteria, these master drivers actively contribute to forging the driver's safety mindset and participate in improving training and qualification processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IN THAILAND, AIR LIQUIDE OPERATES INFRARED DETECTION SYSTEMS AND ON-BOARD CAMERAS ON ITS TRUCKS\n\nSince 2020, Air Liquide Thailand has been operating a detection system on its entire truck fleet using infrared recognition and onboard cameras to help drivers correct any lack of vigilance (fatigue, drowsiness). Safety performance on the road has improved significantly thanks to the detection but also the effective support of drivers, creating a climate of trust that encourages them to  adopt  the right behaviors  and enables the subsidiary to improve its operating methods.\n\n(1)\n\n## IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AIR LIQUIDE DEVELOPS DRIVER TRAINING AND COACHING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTraining and support for drivers is an essential element in achieving 'zero accidents' ambition on the road. It is key for master drivers to  adopt best driving practices and acquire the language to communicate them and influence other drivers to adopt them. In 2022, theoretical and practical training for master drivers, including through driving simulators, was rolled out in Southern Africa. This  program  will be  extended to other  master drivers in 2023.\n\n## 3.4.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nWith regard to risks related to road safety, the year 2022 showed a deterioration in performance compared to the previous year.\n\nIn 2022, the Group faced the death of a subcontracted driver in a road accident. In addition, several accidents involving an Air Liquide vehicle, some of which could have been avoided, unfortunately resulted in the death of third parties.\n\nThe analysis of road accidents  in  recent years has highlighted certain recurring causes, such as fatigue or distraction while driving. For this reason, Air Liquide has launched some key initiatives to support changes in driver behavior and promote the use of digital driver-assistance technologies, which will gradually lead to improvements in road safety (paragraph 3.4.3).\n\nROAD SAFETY: FREQUENCY OF PREVENTABLE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS WITH INJURIES (a)\n\n(a) Per million km driven by trucks of over 3.5 metric tonnes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 3.5. RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT SAFETY\n\n## 3.5.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nThe intrinsic properties of industrial and medical gases manufactured, transformed or packaged by the Group classify them in the hazardous materials category. Their use is safe provided that good practices and recommendations are complied with.\n\nBeyond the risks inherent to the intrinsic properties of gases, other risks must also be considered, such as:\n\n- \u25a0 the  risk  of  faults  in  the systems supplying gas to customers, which could lead to a disruption to supply, in terms of quality or volumes,  which  could  notably have  an  impact on  a patient's health;\n- \u25a0 the  risk of  possible  failure  to  comply  with specific  standards and regulations, in particular in  Healthcare, with the risk of non-compliance of products and services provided to patients.\n\n## 3.5.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe Industrial Management System (IMS) regulatory watch process in place in each Air Liquide Group subsidiary (paragraph 3.1) ensures product compliance with any regulatory changes applicable to them.\n\nLikewise, the IMS procedure on the management of product development includes the  analysis  of  associated  risks, from the moment the products are designed, including the need for them to be used safely.\n\n## 3.5.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nIn compliance with regulations in force, each gas storage device is equipped with a label showing, among other things, the name of the product and the associated risks.\n\nIn the particular case of gas cylinders, the color of the shoulder is different  depending on the  main  risk of  the gas it  contains.  The safety data sheets present the risks of each of these gases. The cylinders are fitted with a cap protecting the valve which must be operated by hand and whose connections differ depending on the gas  in  order to avoid any incorrect  connection.  Their storage  is regulated and must be done in a dedicated place.\n\n## 3.5.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nAir Liquide customers are invited to report to Air Liquide Customer Service any incidents related to the use of the Group's products.\n\nIn the context of Healthcare activities, specific processes such as pharmacovigilance (for products with drug status) and materiovigilance (for products with Medical Device status) are defined to ensure the reporting of incidents concerning these products from healthcare professionals or patients:\n\n- \u25a0 the purpose of pharmacovigilance is to monitor, assess, prevent and manage the risk of adverse effects resulting from the use of drugs. The system set up within Air Liquide Sant\u00e9 International has global coverage and thus makes it possible to constantly monitor and assess the benefit/risk ratio of medical gases. As pharmacovigilance is a science that is highly regulated  by the  health  authorities,  Air  Liquide  Sant\u00e9 International also conducts  a regulatory watch. This activity aims to identify  and analyze  the  applicable  texts  (laws,  best practices, etc.) in order to ensure these operations are conducted in compliance with the defined standards;\n- \u25a0 the purpose of materiovigilance is to avoid the (re)occurrence of incidents and risks of serious incidents involving medical devices, by taking appropriate preventive and/or corrective measures. Air Liquide has specialized teams in its subsidiaries to analyze and deal with any event or risk of incident occurring during the use of medical devices or reported by manufacturers or health authorities. These specialists assess the risk and systematically inform the supplier and health authorities when necessary, while remaining in contact with the various stakeholders until the closure of the alert.\n\n## 3.6. RISKS RELATED TO THE SECURITY OF INDIVIDUALS\n\nThe security of individuals is one of the Group's priorities. It embodies the Group's fundamental principle of responsibility. The security teams have a duty to relay this principle. This is an alignment with the Group's values that promote the overall integration of employees, and external stakeholders such as customers, suppliers and subcontractors, visitors, as well as neighboring communities or Shareholders.\n\n## 3.6.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nIn  addition  to  endogenous risks, i.e. those generated by its own activity (occupational accidents, industrial accidents, etc.), the Group may also be faced with widespread exogenous risks (not generated by its own activity and which come from outside).\n\nThe exposure of employees and the external stakeholders mentioned above to these threats may take the form of verbal or physical assault, theft, or even minor or major crises (e.g. covid-19 pandemic, the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine). It is therefore essential for Air Liquide to properly identify these risks and threats, to analyze and understand them and to put in place security systems that protect employees, whether they are at their usual workplace or they are traveling to a highrisk country.\n\nThe generic mapping of risks related to the security of individuals is based on three types:\n\n- \u25a0 political and security risk;\n- \u25a0 risk related to terrorism;\n- \u25a0 risk related to criminality.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regular assessment procedures\n\nThe Group is attentive to the geopolitical environment of the countries in which it operates. This  is an important criterion in investment decisions. A good understanding of the environments in which the Group operates enables it to adopt a security posture in accordance with its requirements and its duty to protect.\n\nThe Group Security Department establishes a classification of security risks  for  the  countries  in which its  employees work and travel. It is based in particular on the official rating of five countries (France, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and Australia), coupled with an assessment by the global security service  provider  for the  Group.  On a  scale  of  four risk  levels, it enables  the Group to determine  and  implement  the  appropriate level  of security measures corresponding to the  level  of threat identified. The occurrence of serious or repetitive events results in the review  of  a  country's risk  level.  The  country  manager must approve the level of security risk determined for the country.\n\nIn 2022, for the countries in which Air Liquide is present, four are classified  as  very high  risk  (Ukraine, Nigeria,  Mali  and  Burkina Faso) and 11 are high risk. The others are split between moderate and low risk.\n\nIn parallel with this classification,  Air Liquide sets up a threat monitoring. The ability to collect, sort and analyze information makes it possible to understand the specific environments in which employees work by identifying threats and anticipating possible incidents, crises or changes in the structural or economic environment of the countries in which the Group operates. Where necessary, Air Liquide updates the security and travel rules to limit the exposure of its employees and adopts conservative security postures to protect those most exposed.\n\nIn certain unavoidable circumstances, employees may face illegal or criminal acts. It is important to detect, analyze and understand these in order to better protect employees and reduce the risk of occurrence.\n\nIn all its subsidiaries, the Group  has security officers who are regularly trained to adopt the appropriate security posture and implement the security measures that protect employees.\n\n## 3.6.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\nBased  on the  risk assessment,  the Group  Security Department defines and coordinates the implementation of appropriate measures to limit employee exposure to potential negative impacts during a crisis or incident. It has a range of measures that can be deployed, depending on the level of risk identified, in all subsidiaries  to  protect  employees  and  the  external  stakeholders listed above:\n\n- \u25a0 active and passive security systems across all sites. The fundamentals of our site protection policy include secure fencing, a controlled access process, an adapted security and surveillance  system, and  finally, the  means  to  intervene and respond in the event of an intrusion;\n- \u25a0 security reviews are systematically carried out by the Security Officers to ensure the proper level of protection of employees and sites;\n- \u25a0 crisis management and business continuity processes to deal with crisis environments and limit the impact on both employees and organizations;\n- \u25a0 an analysis of the most serious incidents is carried out by the Group Security Department in collaboration with the local entities to adapt the security rules. Surveillance camera systems are set up to record the most critical points of a site and the recordings are viewed after the event in order to understand the origin of potential intrusions;\n- \u25a0 a series of measures intended to protect people who are traveling, throughout their travel:\n- -security awareness training for employees traveling to the most high-risk countries in order to inform them of potential threats and the measures to be applied,\n- -all travel reservations to very high-risk or high-risk country are subject to a validation process by an employee's manager, then by the Security Officer of the geography in question, who may even prohibit the trip,\n- -sending  of  alerts  to  travelers  to make them aware of the most important incidents when they are away,\n- -a dedicated application available to travelers to inform them of imminent threats and thus be rescued as quickly as possible;\n- \u25a0 e-learning  training  in  collaboration  with  Human Resources to familiarize employees with  new environments. Socio-cultural differences are important elements of integration that must be understood and assimilated and which allow for better multicultural integration.\n\nIn very high-risk countries, these security measures will be strengthened.\n\nMore generally and as part of a responsible approach, the Group interacts with some of the most disadvantaged surrounding communities by implementing  actions to benefit them.  In some townships, such as in Brazil or South Africa, local jobs are offered to  integrate  these  communities  and  reduce  the  risk  of  malicious acts, while promoting their integration.\n\nThe security function at Air Liquide is fundamentally part of a logic of goodwill through its positioning of anticipation, prevention and protection. The Group Security Department acts as a player aware of the duty of vigilance and respect for the Group's values in its day-to-day work.\n\n## 3.6.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nThe Group has an incident reporting system which, depending on the level of severity, triggers a review process for these incidents. In a singular way, this system makes it possible to understand the origin of malicious acts and to act locally on the security rules in place to protect employees and third parties.\n\nA security review system enables assessment of the level of protection of a subsidiary in terms of  security according to the level of threat in a country and its sensitivity level. This classification makes it possible to assess whether the security systems are properly deployed in the subsidiaries in order to guarantee the appropriate level of protection for employees and subcontractors.\n\nThese systems are  monitored  by  the  Regional  Security  Officers and the Group Security Director. They make it possible to adapt the security posture according to specific events or crises.",

Environment\n\nThe Group Sustainable Development Department, under the direct supervision of an Executive Vice President, defines the Group's strategy on environmental issues. It ensures the roll-out of  the latter  and  the  definition  and  monitoring  of  the  associated key performance indicators. It is also responsible for internal and external sustainable development communication in order to highlight the Group's achievements, as well as regulatory communication for extra-financial information.\n\nIn addition to the Group's global Sustainable Development approach, employees have volunteered to implement local initiatives within their entities. Known as the 'Sustainability Ambassadors' (1) , the 600 members present in the Group's various  geographies contribute to  raising  employee awareness, finding solutions to protect the environment and sharing best practices.\n\n## 4.1. RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.1.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nIn order to address climate change, Air Liquide takes into account the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as expressed in assessment reports and special reports. The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets set  out in the Paris Agreement, which defines a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C. The IPCC Special Report 'Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C' published in 2018 indicates that achieving the Paris Agreement's objective of keeping the average temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C requires reaching carbon neutrality, on a global scale, by 2050.\n\nIn this context, as a responsible company, Air Liquide recognizes the importance and urgency of addressing climate issues. Based on these scientific facts, Air Liquide intends to contribute to carbon neutrality by addressing the entire value chain, therefore covering direct  greenhouse  gas emissions  (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to electricity and steam procurement (Scope 2) as well as the main indirect emission categories of Scope 3.\n\n## Climate risks related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions\n\nThese risks can have the following consequences on people and the environment:\n\n- \u25a0 new competencies may be required of employees in order to maintain their employability, in particular given the implementation  of  new  technologies  and the  development  of new markets;\n- \u25a0 the massive development of renewable energies used to reduce GHG emissions may have an impact on local communities;\n- \u25a0 due to their consequences on global warming, GHG emissions may have an impact on the environment, in particular on water resources or crop yields.\n\n## Climate risks related to the physical impact\n\nAir Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the world  exposed  to changes (in amplitude and/or frequency) in exceptional meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can have a negative impact on people, which can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters (storms, hurricanes, floods, etc.), whose frequency and severity are increasing, and which could endanger employees or neighboring communities when sites are damaged, particularly those located near the coast or in areas that may be affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, North America, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to longer-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures that could lead to a deterioration in the working conditions of employees in certain geographies (chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and increase in their variability, etc.).\n\n## 4.1.2.  Regular assessment procedures\n\n## Climate risks related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions\n\nThe data relating to GHG emissions reported by the entities are consolidated using a centralization tool at Group level to determine Air Liquide's quarterly and annual carbon footprint.\n\nThe greenhouse gas emissions associated with its activities and exceptional weather-related phenomena due to  climate change can impact the environment and people.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air Liquide follows this classification for the management of its carbon footprint.\n\nAir Liquide's GHG emissions balance sheet takes into account the 6 greenhouse gases highlighted by the Kyoto Protocol and is carried out in accordance with the GHG Protocol's carbon accounting method proposed by the World Resource Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.\n\nSCOPE 1\n\nDirect emissions\n\nemission sources\n\ngenerated by all\n\nowned or controlled by Air Liquide.\n\nIndirect emissions related to the production of electricity or steam purchased outside the Group.

        "page_content": "## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Scope 1\n\nAir Liquide's direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are mainly carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, all expressed in metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent.  Hydrogen production and cogeneration of steam and electricity account for nearly 15% of large production units and use combustion processes emitting CO2. Scope 1 emissions correspond to the difference  in  carbon content between the natural gas consumed by these units and the carbon content of  their products. Air Liquide  also  records direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in its truck fleet. Reporting takes into account a  minimum  of 95% of  the Group's  Scope  1 emissions. Reporting is subject to a continuous improvement process.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nAlmost 85% of Air Liquide's large production units are Air Separation Units,  which do not  use  any combustion  processes, hence do not generate any direct greenhouse gas emissions and consume almost exclusively electrical energy. Electricity used by the Group to power these units generates greenhouse gas emissions at electricity suppliers. Scope 2 totals the indirect GHG emissions generated by the  production  of electricity and  steam purchased outside the Group. These emissions are related to the production of electricity and steam in the various countries where it operates. Reporting takes into account a minimum of 95% of the Group's  Scope  2  emissions. The methodology and reporting  of the sources of  indirect emissions linked  to  electricity  and  steam purchases from third parties are subject to a continuous improvement process; in 2021, the Group adopted a \"marketbased\" reporting for its Scope 2.\n\nAir Liquide has improved the way in which indirect emissions from electricity and steam purchases are recorded, moving from a location-based approach based on the average emission factors of the national network, to a much more precise and specific approach, directly related  to  supply  contracts, called a \"marketbased\" method. By using this method, the Group is adopting the Scope 2 emissions accounting method recommended by the GHG Protocol (2) . From now on, Air Liquide's initiatives in terms of electricity procurement, in particular the voluntary procurement of renewable electricity, are directly reflected in the reported Scope 2 emissions figures.\n\n## Scope 3\n\nThe Group reports other indirect GHG emissions under Scope 3 (categories  1,  2,  3,  4,  6,  7,  11 and  13  of  the GHG Protocol (3) ) which  concern the  Gas  &  Services businesses.  The categories not reported represent emissions that are not applicable in Air  Liquide's business  model (8  and 14), or  negligible  (5,  9,  12 and  15),  or  for  which  the methodology and  reporting are  in  the process of being developed (10).\n\n## Assessing employee competencies to maintain employability\n\nIn response to the climate risks related to greenhouse gas emissions, and the emerging need for employees to have additional competencies to maintain their employability, the assessment focused on the most exposed activities, which are in Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Large Industries:\n\n- \u25a0 within E&C, the engineering and product line teams are those facing the greatest changes in competencies. They involve\n\nemerging disciplines (electrolysis) or  expertise that  needs  to be  strengthened  to  meet  the challenges of energy  transition (CO2  capture  and  liquefaction, hydrogen liquefaction).  These new businesses, combined with the current growth in activity for  E&C,  represent  opportunities  for employees positioned in less buoyant business segments.\n\nE&C renewed its 'SPRING' technical competencies assessment exercise in 2022. It consists in assessing the skills of employees in the technical fields, put into perspective with the needs identified to support E&C's projected activity, in particular with the development of technologies supporting the Group's energy  transition strategy. The assessment  in  2022 focused more specifically on the Electrolysis product line and execution skills (engineering and site activities). Following this SPRING assessment campaign, E&C determined action plans by area of  expertise and by operations center to  meet the development needs of key competencies;\n\n- \u25a0 three Large Industries professions are particularly exposed to a substantial change in their competencies:\n- -production  and  maintenance  teams  on  sites, impacted by the digitization and automation of industrial processes and by the setting up of Smart and Innovative Operations (SIO) centers in charge of remote control of production sites,\n- -sales teams affected by the challenges of the energy transition, which are reflected in the development  of the Group's offerings,\n- -moreover, for the teams in charge of energy management, a 2021-2023 plan has been drawn up to support the development of competencies in a context of increased purchases of renewable  energy.  The  first  two steps were carried out: (i) competency mapping in six key areas of competencies; (ii) identification of competency development and reinforcement needs in each geography.\n\n## Climate risks related to the physical impact\n\nClimate risks related to the physical impact (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.) are assessed during the review of  investment  requests,  in  the  same  way  as  financial  criteria,  to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example, in the design of equipment.\n\nThese risks  are  already  taken  into  account,  especially  in  (i)  the Water Management  Policy (paragraph 4.2.3), which addresses, among other things, water-related risks for production  units for which this risk is proven, and (ii) Business Continuity Plans that ensure the resilience of operations in the event of disruption, including extreme climatic events.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide launched an initiative to consolidate and further improve the risk management  process for climate risks related to the physical impact. The objective is to consolidate and structure  a  procedure for  the Group  in  2023,  to  be deployed in 2024. With the implementation of this procedure, Air Liquide will:\n\n- \u25a0 identify the perils linked to the physical impacts of climate change,  according to  one  or more scenarios with high CO2 emissions;\n- \u25a0 evaluate the importance of these risks for the Group's activities;\n- \u25a0 develop, if necessary, adaptation plans.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In parallel, a first assessment of available climate modeling tools has been conducted.\n\nFor this first step, the Group also relied on the work performed in 2021. A group  of  internal experts, in collaboration  with external stakeholders,  analyzed  risks  triggered by  climate  change  based on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This analysis focused on specific assets to strengthen the understanding of key parameters.\n\n## 4.1.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent severe impacts\n\n## Climate policy and procedures\n\nA Climate  Policy was published in the BlueBook (4) in 2022 to consolidate the principles governing the Group's climate risk management, covering the entire value chain.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of the Group's climate objectives are based on:\n\n- \u25a0 the  internal greenhouse gas emission  monitoring  procedure, which sets out the monitoring of current greenhouse gas emission regulatory obligations with which the Group must comply, the methodology for calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 integration of the monitoring of the CO2 trajectory in the Group's management process, in particular the budget process, which now includes the allocation of a carbon budget to the various geographies, as well as quarterly monitoring per geography and per business line at the Executive Committee level;\n- \u25a0 a review  of  investment decisions,  taking climate factors  into consideration, in particular a CO2 price, along with an analysis of the risks and opportunities related to the climate transition. For  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  those  without  a current official price for CO2, Air Liquide integrates a CO2 price sensitivity study into its investment decision process. Different values are used, including  a  baseline price of 50  euros  per\n\nmetric tonne of CO2, the current local price, as well as a high value of at least 100 euros per metric tonne depending on the geography and the context;\n\n- \u25a0 the roll-out of the Climate Champions network and the regular review of the clusters' (group of countries) decarbonization plans. The Climate Champions, contact points of the Sustainable Development Department, are responsible for managing the Group's CO2 emissions reduction objectives in the various clusters (group of countries). They coordinate the development of a roadmap that defines all the operational measures required to achieve the objectives below. They are responsible for monitoring the indicators, the roll-out of projects and reporting on progress.\n- \u25a0 the  assumption of the  implementation,  in  the  geographies in which the Group operates, of public policies aimed at stepping up the transition toward a low-carbon economy that are in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory.\n\nThe potential impact on local communities due to  the massive development of renewable energies (paragraph 4.1.1) is reviewed on a case by case and ad hoc bases, depending on sources and contractual structures of renewable energy sourcing. As Air  Liquide scales its sourcing of renewable energy, the process will be  further  embedded in  the relevant sourcing guidelines, in particular when sourcing from new built assets.\n\n## Group's Climate Objectives\n\nAs part of the sustainability objectives announced in 2021 and the new strategic plan ADVANCE for the 2022-2025 period, announced in March 2022, Air Liquide's  ambition  is  to  act  for  a low-carbon society. This approach integrates the Group's activities through three complementary axes:\n\n- \u25a0 taking  action on  assets  by  committing to reduce  the carbon impact of production, distribution and service activities;\n- \u25a0 taking action with customers by innovating for a cleaner industry;\n- \u25a0 taking action for ecosystems by contributing to the emergence of a low-carbon society.\n\nASSETS: REDUCING THE CARBON IMPACT OF ITS PRODUCTION, DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE ACTIVITIES\n\n## CLIMATE OBJECTIVES: SCOPES 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS\n\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, and to address the urgency of taking climate change and the energy transition into account, Air Liquide sets itself the ambition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 , with two major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions (5) around 2025;\n- \u25a0 a -33% reduction in its Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions by 2035, compared to the 2020 baseline (6) .\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated Air Liquide's target to reduce its Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 2035 in May 2022 as compliant with a well below 2\u00b0C trajectory (7) . The Group was the first in its industry to obtain validation from the SBTi.\n\nFurthermore, the Group also maintains its existing objective, announced in 2018, to reduce by -30% its carbon intensity (8) by 2025, on the basis of 2015 emissions.",

        "page_content": "## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Vigilance Plan\n\nTo achieve these objectives, the Group has notably identified three key levers to reduce the carbon footprint of its assets, detailed below. These levers are based on the Group's technological and operational expertise, as well as on the implementation of public policies and regulatory frameworks allowing in particular the rapid and massive development of decarbonized energies, which determine the speed at which they can be mobilized.\n\n## Lever 1: sourcing low-carbon energy.\n\nAir Liquide's  ambition  to achieving  carbon neutrality  associated with its assets is usually supported by the sourcing of low-carbon electricity to power the Air Separation Units. Hydrogen production units can be adapted to operate on renewable natural gas.\n\nTo reduce its indirect emissions related to energy purchases (Scope 2 emissions), Air Liquide adopts a proactive approach to purchase renewable and low-carbon electricity using several approaches depending on local conditions allowing access to renewable  energy. The main one  is  the conclusion  of  long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). The share of renewable electricity  should increase  in  the  coming years  as new PPA are expected to be signed regularly.\n\nNevertheless, the Group may rely on the purchase of certificates such  as  Guarantees  of  Origin that  may or  may  not be bundled with power delivery especially when integration of a PPA into the sourcing portfolio is difficult or, on 'green tariffs' in areas supplied by regulated utilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide notably signed the following contracts:\n\n- \u25a0 its biggest long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to date with approximately 115 MW of new offshore wind electricity, for 15 years starting in 2025, purchased to Vattenfall in the Netherlands. This PPA comes in addition to a previous agreement announced with Vattenfall in March 2021. Over the contract duration, this will avoid the emission of up to 3.5 million tonnes of CO2;\n- \u25a0 a  10-year  contract  with Shell  Energy  Europe  Limited  (SEEL) for the purchase of renewable energy to power industrial and medical  gas  production  operations in  the  North  East  of Italy. From 2023, and for 10 years, Air Liquide will purchase 52 GWh per year of solar photovoltaic renewable energy. This agreement will result in around 24,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions being saved a year;\n- \u25a0 two PPA with Enel Green Power for the long-term supply of a total capacity of 220 MW of renewable power to the Secunda sites of Air Liquide and Sasol, in South Africa. These two wind projects will  significantly  contribute to  the  decarbonization  of the Secunda site. This agreement is subject to regulatory and financial approvals.\n\n## Lever 2: improving the efficiency of assets.\n\nAir Liquide constantly improves the design of its production units and modernizes them thanks to the innovation efforts of Research & Development and Engineering & Construction teams in order to improve their energy efficiency and reduce their energy consumption. The Group continues to roll out the Smart Innovative Operations (SIO) program which optimizes energy consumption and procurement through centralized operation centers.\n\nAir Liquide uses a large fleet of trucks for the supply of industrial gases to its customers. These vehicles contribute to the Group's greenhouse  gas  emissions. Air  Liquide  therefore  takes  targeted actions to reduce logistics-related emissions by leveraging digital resources to optimize deliveries, and by progressively converting its fleet to alternate fuels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nTwo major semiconductor market leaders have awarded Air  Liquide long-term contracts for the supply of ultra-high purity industrial gases in Japan. Air Liquide will build, own and operate production plants. Compared to previous generation units, the four energy efficient plants will  enable the Group to avoid the emission of an estimated 35,000 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\nAirgas,  an Air  Liquide  company, has  signed an  agreement with Hyzon Motors, a global supplier of zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell powered commercial vehicles, to pilot two heavy duty hydrogen fuel cell trucks, including one 100 kW fuel cell truck and the first  Hyzon 200  kW  hydrogen  fuel cell powered  truck to  be tested commercially. These two trucks will be the first heavy duty hydrogen fuel  cell powered  trucks within the  Air  Liquide Group globally  and  are slated  to  be  tested  in various  cylinder  delivery routes in the Los Angeles, California area.\n\n## Lever 3: rolling-out innovative technologies.\n\nAir  Liquide  has  developed a portfolio of proprietary technologies such as Cryocap\u2122, which allow CO2 to be captured and reused or stored on Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) units for the production of hydrogen. Capture for CO2 valorization and storage is thus set to play a major role in reducing direct emissions from hydrogen production.\n\nAir Liquide is committed to producing low-carbon hydrogen on an industrial  scale  and  in  a  sustainable  manner. The  electrolysis  of water is one  of the key solutions to produce hydrogen with a minimal carbon footprint, when powered by low-carbon electricity. The installation of electrolyzer units therefore plays a critical role to enable the production of low-carbon hydrogen on a large scale for industry and mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These units are designed to replace current supply from a third party coal-based gasification unit. They will also be equipped with CO2 capture and recycle technology. This project will avoid the emission of 350,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. These units will produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide for the supply to Covestro China and Shanghai Lianheng Isocyanate Company in the Park.\n\nAir  Liquide  received  support  from  the  French  State  to  launch  its Air Liquide  Normand'Hy large scale renewable hydrogen production project. This  electrolyzer of  an initial  200 MW capacity  will use  Siemens  Energy's  Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology. Air Liquide has signed a Memorandum of Understanding  with TotalEnergies aiming at the  signing of  a  long term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for part of the needs of the Air Liquide Normand'Hy electrolyzer. The latter should notably provide renewable hydrogen to TotalEnergies' Normandy refinery and to industrial companies of the Normandy basin.\n\nAir Liquide and Siemens Energy announced the creation of a joint venture dedicated to the series production of industrial scale renewable hydrogen electrolyzers in Europe. The factory will supply electrolysis modules ('stacks') to both Groups for their respective broad range of customers and to serve the rapidly growing market. Based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis technology, these stacks will feature a high degree of efficiency and are ideally suited to harvest volatile renewable energy.\n\n## CUSTOMERS: INNOVATING WITH CUSTOMERS FOR A CLEANER INDUSTRY\n\nAir Liquide also continues to provide its customers with low-carbon solutions to help them reduce their carbon footprint. Drawing on its technological expertise and its capacity for innovation, the Group offers them cleaner and more sustainable solutions to reduce their CO2 emissions.\n\n## SCOPE 3 COMMITMENT\n\nAware of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategy. The importance of the relationship with its customers has led the Group to pledge to have 75% of its 50 largest customers committed to carbon neutrality by 2025 and 100% by 2035.\n\nTo achieve this ambition, the following levers have been identified:\n\n## Lever 1: reducing Air Liquide products' carbon footprint.\n\nAir Liquide relies on its expertise to offer its customers innovative solutions to support them by outsourcing their needs to pool production assets and thus aim for greater energy efficiency. Air Liquide proposes to install units directly on its customers' sites in order to save on transportation or to provide a new generation of lighter cylinders, and thus reduce transport-related CO2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 ILLUSTRATION\n\nAir Liquide will invest in a new Air Separation Unit (ASU) dedicated to Industrial Merchant activities in Kosi, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Northern India, which is planned to start operating by the end of 2023. This plant has been designed to contribute to a successful energy transition by India. The new unit is indeed planned to fully operate on renewable energy by 2030 to accompany the development of India and its growing demand for sustainable solutions.\n\n## Lever 2: co-developing innovative processes with customers.\n\nAir Liquide supports its customers in the fundamental and essential transformation of their industrial processes, in particular in industrial sectors such as metallurgy and chemicals. The Group provides technical innovations to reduce the CO2 emissions associated with the conventional processes used in these sectors by employing new production processes, such as oxy-combustion for cement coupled with CO2 capture, direct reduced iron (DRI unit) combined with submerged arc furnace for steel production, or new uses of materials such as hydrogen.",

Air Liquide will  support this  initiative  by  supplying oxygen  to EQIOM's production process and by leveraging its proprietary technology Cryocap\u2122 Oxy to capture and liquefy the CO2 emissions. The project aims to capture around 8 million tonnes of CO2 over the first ten years of operation.\n\nAir Liquide and TotalEnergies are innovating, in the context of the conversion to a biorefinery of the TotalEnergies' Grandpuits site, to produce and valorize renewable and low-carbon hydrogen. Air Liquide will  build  and  operate  at  the  Grandpuits site  a  new  hydrogen production unit with an annual capacity of more than 20,000 tonnes. By recycling, in part, residual biogases from Grandpuits' biorefinery as a substitute for the natural gas traditionally used, the hydrogen produced by this unit will be partly renewable. In addition, this unit will include, from its start-up, an Air Liquide Cryocap\u2122 H2 carbon capture unit. This will enable to capture, for reuse in agri-food and industrial applications,  over 110,000 tonnes of CO2 per  year  contributing  to  reducing  the  site's  carbon  footprint.  These  innovations will  prevent emissions amounting to 150,000 tonnes of CO2 a year compared to current processes.\n\n## Lever 3: developing innovative carbon capture technologies.\n\nAir Liquide's presence in major industrial basins, combined with its expertise in carbon capture and liquefaction technologies allows the Group to contribute to major global initiatives aimed at aggregating large streams of CO2 in order to capture them for valorization and storage.\n\n## 2022 ILLUSTRATIONS\n\nAir Liquide and Lhoist have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the aim to decarbonize Lhoist's lime production plant in Northern France, using Air Liquide's innovative and proprietary Cryocap\u2122 carbon capture technology. Air Liquide would build and operate a unit of its innovative and proprietary Cryocap\u2122 FG (Flue Gas) technology to capture and purify 95% of the CO2 arising from Lhoist's existing lime production unit.  Thanks  to  this  project, Lhoist would  be  able to  reduce the  CO2  emissions of the  plant by more  than 600,000 tonnes per year starting in 2028. Air Liquide's Cryocap\u2122 technology would thus be used for the first time to decarbonize lime production in France.\n\nAir  Liquide  and  Eni  have  entered  into  a collaboration  agreement  aimed at  assessing  decarbonization  solutions  in the  Mediterranean region of Europe, focused on hard-to-abate industrial sectors. The two companies join forces combining their well-established expertise and know-how to enable CO2 capture, aggregation, transport and permanent storage. Air Liquide will develop competitive CO2 abatement solutions,  leveraging  on its  ongoing  Carbon Capture  and Sequestration  (CCS)  in  Northern  Europe and  on its  innovative proprietary technology Cryocap\u2122 able to capture up to 95% of CO2 emissions from industrial facilities.\n\n## ECOSYSTEMS: CONTRIBUTING TO THE EMERGENCE OF A LOW-CARBON SOCIETY\n\nAir Liquide  contributes  to  the development  of  a  low-carbon  society.  To  this  end, the  Group develops hydrogen and  biomethane for industrial and mobility applications. These developments are expected to play a key role in the fight against climate change. The Group has therefore identified the following levers:\n\n## Lever 1: promoting hydrogen (H2) for energy transition.\n\nHydrogen is an essential solution for the energy transition. A competitive and low-carbon solution, it represents tremendous development potential thanks to its many applications in industry, energy and mobility. Deeply convinced that hydrogen will play a major role in the energy transition, the Group intends to be a key player in the emergence of a hydrogen society thanks to its assets, its technologies and its expertise. Air  Liquide  is  in  particular one of  the  founding  members  of  the  Hydrogen Council,  a  unique global  initiative  that brings together nearly 150 companies in 2022 and aims to define a common ambition for hydrogen as an accelerator for the energy transition. Around 8 billion euros will be invested by the Group in the low-carbon hydrogen value chain by 2035. Hydrogen sales are expected to triple to 6 billion euros by 2035.\n\n## 2022 ILLUSTRATION\n\nAir Liquide joins forces with Lotte, one of the largest groups in South Korea, to co-invest in a new generation of large scale hydrogen filling centers in South Korea. The first two units will be strategically located in the industrial basins of Dasean and Ulsan to notably serve the densely populated regions of Seoul metropolitan area. Air Liquide will bring its expertise in design, manufacturing and operation of key hydrogen technologies, including for hydrogen conditioning and distribution, and hydrogen refueling stations.\n\n## Lever 2: contributing to the development of clean mobility.\n\nAir  Liquide  is  investing  in  the production  of  low-carbon  hydrogen  from  the  electrolysis  of  water,  as well  as  in  H2  mobility  distribution networks. The Group is also developing the biomethane chain from production to filling stations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This will include infrastructure development and vehicle fleets,  to  accelerate  the expansion  of hydrogen mobility for both light and heavy-duty vehicles. The three companies will use their complementary expertise to address the entire value chain of hydrogen mobility, ranging from renewable or low-carbon hydrogen production, distribution and refueling infrastructure to the deployment of different vehicle segments.\n\nAir Liquide invested and operates its first biomethane production unit  in  China since  the  end  of 2022. This new unit  will  produce biogas  from agricultural and livestock waste coming from local farms and purify it into biomethane. With a total production capacity of 75 GWh per year, the unit will inject the biomethane into the city gas grid to be used for household consumption and also generate electricity for its own consumption and injection into the electrical grid.\n\n## Lever 3: contributing to the circular economy through the development and diversification of biomethane.\n\nAir Liquide is a committed stakeholder across the entire biomethane value chain for sustainable transportation and for the development of the circular economy, from biogas supply and purification for the production of biomethane (which can be directly  injected into  the gas network), to distribution to  the  final customers.  In 2022,  Air  Liquide  has 22 biomethane production units worldwide for a yearly production capacity of 1.6 TWh.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 ILLUSTRATION\n\nAir Liquide inaugurated its first biomethane production unit in Italy with its local partner Dentro il Sole (DIS). Located in Truccazzano, near Milan, the unit contributes to the decarbonization of the transport sector by valorizing agricultural and livestock waste from local farms to produce liquefied biomethane.\n\n## Employee engagement and training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTRODUCING REUSABLE PLASTIC CAPS ON GAS CYLINDERS\n\nIn Austria, a system of reusable plastic caps has been implemented by a 'Sustainability Ambassador' on gas cylinders to limit the use of plastic and its inadvertent dispersion by customers into  nature.  With  the  support of  the Ambassador's management, the use  of  reusable caps was  successfully tested  for  one year, which led to a reduction in environmental impact as well as savings in handling time and procurement. The concept has been extended to other cylinder types in Austria and could be deployed more widely in the Group.\n\nIn order to train employees on the sustainability objectives announced by the Group in March 2021, modules have been created by Air Liquide University on the themes of energy transition, innovation and circular economy. The Group has set up\n\na training course on the energy transition, including webinars on the causes and consequences of climate change and on Air  Liquide's  decarbonization  strategy. The  training  sessions are open to all employees. They can also access the recordings available on the  Air Liquide University digital platform.  Specific training courses were introduced for operational teams to inform employees of the Group's sustainability objectives and their operational rollout.\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE STRENGTHENS ITS TRAINING PROGRAM ON CLIMATE AND ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide University included a one-and-a-half-hour webinar on climate change, led by a Sustainability Ambassador, who took the initiative to organize regular awareness-raising sessions in his department. On a voluntary basis, Group employees were able to register for this interactive webinar detailing  in  a  simplified  and  educational way the science behind climate change, as well as the main findings of the IPCC report. Around 350 employees benefited from this training.\n\nIn response to the climate risks related to greenhouse gas emissions, and the emerging need for employees to have additional competencies to maintain their employability, initiatives have  been  launched, particularly in Engineering  & Construction (E&C) and Large Industries business lines, to support them in the transition to new technologies and the development of new markets:\n\n- \u25a0 in E&C, an Electrolysis product line integrating the entire value chain, from solution definition to project execution, was created in 2021. It has integrated nearly 30 employees from other organizations within E&C. Cross-functional mobility remains the preferred way to develop rich career paths and strengthen the flexibility and employability of teams;\n- \u25a0 in Large Industries, actions have been taken according to the type of profession concerned:\n- -for  operations and maintenance: a training curriculum has been offered to operations managers on-site since 2020 to support the digitization of industrial processes (maintenance,  reliability,  safety)  and the  evolution of their functions,\n- -for the sales teams: the training curriculum is updated several times a year and rolled out to strengthen the teams' skills. The implementation of individual development plans is underway,\n- -for the teams in charge of energy management, two priority actions are being rolled out: (i) the implementation of individual development plans; (ii) the construction of a training offer in the areas of six key competencies for 'Energy Managers' as a priority, as well as for Air Liquide's management, sales teams and all of  the Group's  teams exposed to these developments.\n\n## Climate risks related to the physical impact\n\nThe Group's operations regularly exposed to the acute risks (paragraph 4.1.1) have risk management systems aimed at adopting appropriate preventive operational measures and managing these crises by, first and foremost, protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.",

This reflects the Group's strong commitment to controlling its CO2 emissions trajectory and the measures implemented.\n\nReported emissions increased in 2022 due to the full-year inclusion of emissions related to the assets acquired from Sasol, which  only contributed to  reported  emissions in 2021  from the date of their integration on June 24, 2021. The implementation of emission reduction plans in the various regions where the Group operates have helped moderate the increase of emissions, despite its strong growth in activity.\n\nAs a result, the volumes of renewable electricity, in the electricity supply, have increased by approximately 10% in 2022. The growth in the volume of renewable electricity, in the Group's purchases,  is set to continue  and accelerate, as shown by the signing of several long-term contracts (PPAs) in 2022, namely with Vattenfall in the Netherlands, with Shell Energy Europe Limited  and  with  Enel  Green  Power,  jointly  with  Sasol,  in  South Africa.  In  addition, the  Group  continues  to  develop  CO2 capture projects to reduce emissions associated with hydrogen production, such as the Kairos@C and Antwerp@C projects.\n\n|                                                   |                                                           | 2015 baseline   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |     |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|-----|\n| Objective 2:  reduce carbon                       | Carbon intensity  (a)                                     | 7.3             | 5.2    | 5.5    | 5.5    | (b) |\n| intensity  (a)  by -30% by 2025  compared to 2015 | Change in carbon intensity  (a)  compared to 2015  (in %) | -               | -29 %  | -24 %  | -25 %  |     |\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Sasol Air Separation Units in South Africa  on  June  24,  2021,  the  Group's  carbon  intensity (11) increased in 2021, reflecting only half-year impact, from the date of acquisition. The 2022 emissions include a full year of operation of these acquired units. Nevertheless, the control of the CO2 emissions trajectory and the Group's financial results have allowed the carbon intensity to stabilize from 2022.\n\nIn order  to  complete the  measurement  of  progress  towards  the CO2 emissions reduction objectives, the Group has identified the following key  indicators. They track  the progress resulting  from the actions implemented and described in paragraph 4.1.3.\n\n2050, and  in the  medium  term, to reducing  its  greenhouse  gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) (9) in absolute value by 2035 by -33% compared to the 2020 baseline, with an inflexion point in around 2025. The Group also maintains its previously announced objective of -30% reduction in carbon intensity by 2025 compared to 2015.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since the creation of this collective, their initiatives have been recorded and communicated at the Group level in order to be replicated.\n\n## TYPES OF INITIATIVES IN 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued to raise employee awareness of the various  actions undertaken  in favor of  sustainable  development (presentation of the sustainability objectives, challenges of the energy transition, actions available to employees to contribute to sustainability, etc.).\n\n## TRAINING IN 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2. RISKS RELATED TO WATER MANAGEMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2.1.  Description of salient risks\n\nAir Liquide respects the human right to water and sanitation. Water  management  in  its  activities can have  two main  types  of impact on people, related to the withdrawal and consumption of water  on  the sites  where  the Group operates, or  related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems after usage.\n\n## Risks related to the withdrawal and use of water\n\nImpacts associated with water withdrawal may vary depending on the location. Areas where it is difficult to meet human and environmental needs for water due to poor availability, quality or accessibility are called water stress areas. In these areas, conflicts for water between different usages and users may arise.\n\n## Risks related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems\n\nThe quality and specifications of the water returned to ecosystems are important in assessing the impact of the Group's operations, either because of the presence of pollutants, contaminants content, or  the temperature,  which can  induce  direct  or indirect pollution and damages to ecosystems.\n\n## 4.2.2. Regular assessment procedures\n\n## Risks related to the withdrawal and use of water\n\nWater consumption is measured by subtracting water return from water withdrawal by the Group in the course of its business. The difference is due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the loss of water through evaporation in the cooling process of rotating machines, particularly for the production of air gases; and\n- \u25a0 its use as a raw material for the manufacture of products such as hydrogen.\n\nWith regard to Air Separation Units (ASU), there are several types of cooling systems:\n\n- \u25a0 54% of these units have semi-open water circuits, where some of the water evaporates during cooling;\n- \u25a0 39% of these units have open circuits. Water runs through the plant for cooling purposes and all water withdrawn is returned. Both types of units require continuous water top-ups for cooling;",

    {
        "page_content": "- \u25a0 finally, the other units have closed systems, which do not withdraw water from their surrounding environment. The latter no longer consume water after the initial filling.\n\nAs water is a limited resource and not equally available across all regions, Air Liquide has assessed the risks associated with water consumption at its sites by referring to the 'Aqueduct 3.0 Water Risk Atlas', the latest map of the World Resource Institute (WRI) published in August 2019. This assessment takes into account the specific data for each site according to its location in relation to a watershed, groundwater and an administrative boundary.\n\nTo  carry  out  this assessment, the  Group  used  the 'business  as usual'  scenario  (SSP2 RCP8.5 of the  IPCC).  Each site is thus identified as belonging to water stress area or not (area defined according to the  intensity of water conflict). This mapping  also includes new units.\n\nAn analysis conducted in 2022 and targeting operations with high water consumption (identified as facilities with water withdrawal in excess of 50 000 m 3 per year) shows that 78 sites are located in high or extremely high water stress areas. By 2025, 100% of these sites  aim  to  implement  a  documented  water  management plan to reduce the risks related to water withdrawal and use.\n\n## Risks related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems\n\nMeasurements and  analyses of discharged  water, to  assess its quality, are carried out at a frequency consistent with and according to the requirements laid down in local regulations.\n\n## 4.2.3.  Appropriate actions to mitigate risks and prevent serious impacts\n\n## Water management policy\n\nTo manage the risks associated with water withdrawal and use as well as the quality of the water returned to ecosystems, a water management policy was published in  the  BlueBook (12) in  2021. This policy identifies the impacts of  Air Liquide's activities on water availability and quality. The policy defines the principles of risk management based on a thorough assessment of the situation at each site. Finally, it describes the actions to be implemented to ensure appropriate water management.\n\n## WATER MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide launched the roll-out of this policy by focusing on the following objectives, defined for the Group in 2021:\n\n- \u25a0 implementing a documented water management plan by 2025 in  100% of the  sites  concerned,  aimed  at  reducing  the risks related to water withdrawal and use for water-intensive operations in high water stress areas;\n- \u25a0 defining and implementing a Group-wide standard for all operations, that goes beyond existing local processes and procedures, to ensure that the quality of discharged water meets or exceeds applicable local criteria.\n\n## Organizational structure and reporting tool\n\nAir Liquide has a network of water experts across all regions. They are the dedicated contact points for all questions relating to water and its use and are responsible for verifying data (withdrawal, discharge,  quality).  In  2022,  a  work  group bringing together several of these experts drew up the foundation necessary for the roll-out of the Group's water management policy. This consisted, on the one hand, in assessing sites\n\naccording to their level of water use and their location in a water stress area, and on the other hand, in creating guidelines, standards and tools to support the field application, planned from 2023. In this context, the Group now has:\n\n- \u25a0 guidelines and tools for the implementation of a water management plan for high  water  consumption  operations in high water stress areas;\n- \u25a0 new technical standards for the monitoring and control of discharged water, which will be issued to all operations in 2023.\n\nIn  addition,  in  2022,  the  Group  continued  to  improve  water  data collection  and reporting  accuracy. The  technical  procedure  used for the reporting of environmental data has been updated. Training webinars were organized for operational teams in charge of environmental data reporting.\n\n## Water treatment solutions\n\nAir Liquide provides its customers with efficient and easy-toimplement solutions for water treatment to face environmental challenges especially in the fight against water stress and scarcity.\n\nOxygen (O2), ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) play a fundamental role in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes. These gases are key to balance mineral levels in desalination water plants, or to eliminate pollutants from surface drinking water. For industrial players seeking technologies to treat and recycle water, these molecules help boost the  removal of organic pollution from wastewater and to avoid corrosion or clogging in cooling systems.\n\n## 4.2.4.  Monitoring scheme of measures implemented and the assessment of their effectiveness\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide withdrew  973 millions of m 3 of  water from various sources. 87% was provided by customers, 6% came from freshwater sources such as rivers or  lakes,  2%  from municipal sources  and the  remaining  5%  from  various other sources. The Group returned 90.6% of this water and the Group's actual consumption was 91 million m 3 .\n\nIn 2022, more  than 40% the  water  discharged from Air Liquide facilities  has  been  reused  by  third  parties  (generally,  customers) for their own usage, after treatment, if necessary. This use allowed the third party not to withdraw the corresponding amount of water from the environment.\n\n|                                                              |   2020 |   2021 |     |   2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----|--------|\n| Annual water withdrawal  (estimate in millions of m 3 ) (a)  |    257 |    950 | (b) |    973 |\n| Annual water consumption  (estimate in millions of m 3 ) (c) |     90 |     82 |     |     91 |\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide consumed 91 millions of m\u00b3 of water, a 11% increase compared with 2021, which is mainly related to acquisitions, and in particular to the acquisition of the Sasol production units in South Africa.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's largest procurement categories are  energy, technical services, welding hardgoods and equipment.\n\nTwo levels of the organization are involved in procurement activities in the Air Liquide Group. The Group Procurement Department and the corresponding functions in the hubs and World Business Units are responsible for  the main procurement categories, with the exception of energy purchases. The latter are managed by departments specialized in energy management. The Group Procurement Department drew up a Sustainable Procurement procedure in 2012, and updates it regularly (1) to take into account any regulatory changes and the Group's ambitions (2) .\n\n## 5.1. RISK MAPPING\n\n## 5.1.1.  Methodology\n\nThe duty  of  vigilance  risk mapping methodology for suppliers  is based on identifying the suppliers most exposed to sustainability risks (Sustainability-Critical Suppliers). For this purpose, four criteria are used:\n\n- 1\u00b0 annual spend;\n- 2\u00b0 the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity;\n- 3\u00b0 the risk relating to the supplier's country of operation; and\n- 4\u00b0 the supplier's dependency on Air Liquide.\n\nThe amount of annual spend is used to prioritize the suppliers and systematically include in the identification of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers those on whom the Group spends more than 200,000 euros per year.\n\n## Identification criteria\n\n| 1\u00b0 Annual spend   | 2\u00b0 Risk relating to the nature of the activity   | 3\u00b0 Risk relating to the  country of operation   | 4\u00b0 Dependency                                |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| >\u20ac200K            | Severe                                           | Regardless of the risk  level                   | Regardless of the supplier  dependency ratio |\n| >\u20ac200K            | High and medium high                             | High and medium                                 | Regardless of the supplier  dependency ratio |\n| >\u20ac200K            | High and medium high                             | Low                                             | Regardless of the supplier  dependency ratio |\n| >\u20ac200K            | Medium low, low and very low                     | Regardless of the risk  level                   | >25%                                         |\n\nIn addition to the criteria set out  above, the  local Procurement functions are free to determine more stringent criteria, in particular due to specific risks identified, so that other suppliers are selected as Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\n## 5.1.2.  Results in 2022\n\nThe mapping  of supplier-related  risks is  updated  on an  annual basis by a work group composed of the Sustainable Procurement Department at  Group level and buyers who are specialized  by category.\n\nIn 2022, based on the methodology described above, 1,177 suppliers were identified as Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\nThe three most exposed procurement categories in number of suppliers identified are transport services, installation and erection services  as  well  as waste  management and treatment  services. The  1,177  Sustainability-Critical  Suppliers  are  spread  across  all the geographies  where  the  Group operates, as indicated  in  the table below.\n\n|                        | Sustainable Critical Suppliers   | Sustainable Critical Suppliers   |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Geographies            | Number                           | %                                |\n| Asia Pacific           | 662                              | 56%                              |\n| Europe                 | 343                              | 29%                              |\n| Middle East and Africa | 130                              | 11%                              |\n| Americas               | 42                               | 4%                               |\n| Total                  | 1,177                            | 100%                             |\n\nThe nature of a supplier's activity depends on its allocation to one of 17 procurement categories, which are subdivided into more than 400 procurement sub-categories. For a more precise methodology, each procurement sub-category is allocated a global sustainability risk level, which includes in particular the environment, human rights and working conditions, on a six-level scale (severe, high, medium high, medium low, low, very low).\n\nThe risk relating to the supplier's country of operation is assessed based on a weighting of recognized public indicators on the environment (e.g. Environmental Performance Index, EPI), the health and social situation (e.g. Human Development Index, HDI) and human rights (e.g. Global Slavery Index, ITUC Global Rights Index), on a three-level scale (high, medium, low).\n\nThe dependency of suppliers on Air Liquide is also an important criterion. For example, a decrease in Air Liquide's activity with a supplier could have a social impact on the jobs of its employees. The dependency ratio calculated corresponds to the supplier's actual sales with Air Liquide divided by the supplier's total sales for the year under consideration.\n\nSuppliers are analyzed through a grid with these four criteria. If a supplier, beyond 200,000 euros of annual spend, presents a combination  of risks as indicated  in  the table below, it is then identified as Sustainability-Critical Supplier and requires the implementation of additional assessment measures or action plans.",

Supplier qualification\n\nIn addition to the Sustainable Procurement procedure, the Group Procurement Department has defined a procedure for supplier relationship and  risk management (3) which applies to all  Group entities. This procedure aims to maximize the value and minimize the risks of Air Liquide's interactions with its suppliers while optimizing the use of Group resources. It defines the supplier qualification process, which ensures that it is able to meet Air  Liquide's requirements, including  compliance  with applicable laws and regulations and integrity (fight against fraud and corruption, respect  for  human  rights  and  international sanctions, etc.).\n\nThis  procedure  requires  that  a  new  supplier be subject to  basic checks prior to qualification. These checks are based on the use of Dow Jones databases including in particular international sanction lists and any existing negative press articles on a supplier. In 2021, Air Liquide specified its method for analyzing the results of these checks in order to make a decision on the qualification  of a supplier. In 2022,  100%  of the  new  suppliers created  in the information system were subject to these  basic checks.\n\n## 5.2.2.  Assessment methodology\n\nThe evaluation of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers is mainly carried out using two kinds of questionnaire:\n\n- \u25a0 by an external platform (in 2022, EcoVadis) specialized in the assessment of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) performance which deploys an online questionnaire based on the  ISO  26000 standard to  assess  the CSR commitment  of suppliers. The main themes covered in this questionnaire include the environment, ethics, human rights and working conditions, and the sustainable procurement procedures implemented by suppliers; or\n- \u25a0 by Air Liquide, which created an internal  questionnaire in 2019, as an alternative to the solution offered by the external platform. This questionnaire is sent to Sustainability-Critical Suppliers selected for the assessment campaign who refused to reply to the questionnaire sent by the external platform.\n\n## 5.2.3.  Assessment results\n\nAnswers provided in the questionnaires and supporting documentation produced by the suppliers are assessed by the experts from the EcoVadis external platform or by Air Liquide buyers, on a scale of 100 points. The score obtained reflects the supplier's CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) performance.\n\nAccording to the results of the assessment, suppliers can be considered as a:\n\n- \u25a0 Responsible supplier: if the global score is equal to or greater than 45/100 and no theme is rated less than or equal to 20/100, the supplier meets Air Liquide Sustainable\n- Procurement procedure requirements. Validity of the score: five years or upon renewal of its contract (whichever comes first);\n- \u25a0 Supplier needing improvement: global score between 25/100  and  44/100 or when the global  score  is equal  to or greater than 45/100 but one theme is rated less than or equal to 20/100.\n- Validity of the score: three years, during which the supplier will implement a corrective action plan. An on-site environmental/ social audit may be decided to help define the action plan;\n- \u25a0 Non-compliant  supplier: global score  less  than  or equal  to 24/100.\n- Validity of the score: one year. A corrective action plan is required in the month following its rating and must be implemented  before  the supplier's reassessment 12 months after its rating.\n\n| Assessment of a  Sustainability-Critical   | Supplier score for each  (a)                                      | Overall supplier score   | Overall supplier score   | Overall supplier score   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Assessment of a  Sustainability-Critical   | of the 4 themes   assessed                                        | \u226545                      | between 25 and 44        | \u226424                      |\n| Assessment of a  Sustainability-Critical   | If all themes obtain a score >20 If one theme obtains a score \u226420 |                          |                          |                          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe environment, ethics, human rights and working conditions, and the sustainable procurement procedures implemented by suppliers.\n\nResponsible supplier.\n\nSupplier needing improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-compliant supplier.\n\n## 5.3. APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO MITIGATE RISKS AND PREVENT SEVERE IMPACTS\n\n## 5.3.1.  Procedures\n\nIn order to mitigate risks or prevent severe impacts relating to the duty of vigilance, Air Liquide rolls out all elements of the Sustainable Procurement procedure, including in particular the following prevention measures:\n\n- \u25a0 application of the Procurement Code of Conduct ,  which is available in 11 languages, is mandatory for all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n\n- \u25a0 the Supplier's  Code of  Conduct , which is available in 14 languages, aims, in particular, to promote and ensure that all suppliers respect practices relating to human rights, the protection of the environment and safety. This code is publicly available on the Air Liquide website ( It is based on the Group's Code of Conduct and https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/sustainableprocurement).\n- all suppliers have to adhere to it / sign it;\n- \u25a0 a sustainability contractual clause (covering compliance with the Supplier's Code of Conduct, safety, and the environment) is included in the contract templates with suppliers, including those for framework agreements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Corrective action plans\n\nThe Sustainable Procurement function, within the Procurement Department, coordinates  the implementation  of corrective  action plans through a network of Sustainable Procurement correspondents present in each hub and World Business Unit.\n\nIn  accordance with the assessment procedure for SustainabilityCritical Suppliers described  in paragraph 5.2,  suppliers  needing improvement and non-compliant suppliers must establish a corrective action plan.\n\nDepending on the size of the company or the type of actions to be rolled  out,  these  plans  can  be  established  in different  ways, for example:\n\n- \u25a0 on  the basis of the  improvement  areas identified  during the assessment on the external platform or in the internal questionnaire;\n- \u25a0 through participation of the suppliers in training sessions organized by the Sustainable Procurement correspondents on sustainability-related topics.\n\n## 5.3.3.  Training\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide organized training sessions in French, English and Chinese to raise awareness among buyers and suppliers of the Group's Sustainable Procurement approach and thus strengthen its roll out throughout the organization. Training courses are organized by subject and by geography.\n\nSome training courses cover, in particular,  the commitments of new suppliers, the implementation of corrective action plans, the internal assessment questionnaire, as well as inclusive procurement. For buyers, these training modules also present the consistency between the Sustainable Procurement approach and Group strategy, explain the stakes of this approach and position it as a source of value creation.\n\nA total of  279  buyers and 82 suppliers were trained  in  2022  on topics related to sustainability and the duty of vigilance.\n\n## 5.3.4.  'Procure to Neutrality', the Procurement climate roadmap\n\nIn its new strategic plan ADVANCE for the 2022-2025 period, announced in March 2022, Air Liquide reaffirmed its ambition to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Procurement has a key role to play in supporting this objective throughout the supply chain of the Group's businesses, in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 by supporting its suppliers in the decarbonization of the goods and services that the Group purchases;\n- \u25a0 by helping to reduce the Group's emissions; and\n- \u25a0 by contributing to the development of low-carbon solutions offered to its customers.\n\nIn 2021, the  Group  Procurement  Department initiated  a  climate roadmap, 'Procure to Neutrality' based on four pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 Measure :  improve the greenhouse gas  emission calculation methodology (Scope 3), where relevant and feasible;\n- \u25a0 Engage buyers, with the training of the procurement community; engage our suppliers identified on the basis of a mapping as the most significant in terms of emissions;\n- \u25a0 Leverage to value  contributions  of  Procurement to reducing Air Liquide's Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions;\n- \u25a0 Reduce : define an objective, with the aim of aligning with the Group's carbon neutrality ambition.\n\nIn 2022, around 30% of the Procurement community took part in training sessions on key concepts for understanding climate issues, carbon accounting methodologies and greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives. In addition,  75 suppliers, among those most exposed to risks related to greenhouse gas emissions, were asked to answer a dedicated questionnaire to evaluate their level of maturity in this area.\n\nIn June 2022, Air Liquide was awarded one of the two Gold Medals in the 'Procurement Team of the Year Challenge' category at the Procurement Awards in France ( for the creation of a module integrating the assessment of suppliers' climate maturity and CO2 emissions linked to manufacturing, transport and equipment use. This module is integrated into the selection criteria for suppliers of strategic equipment. https://www.republikgroupachats.fr/laureats-trophees-des-achats-2022)\n\n## 5.3.5.  The Observatory for Sustainable Procurement\n\nAir Liquide also takes part in collaborative and multi-sector initiatives for sustainable procurement, in particular as a member of ObsAR (the French Observatory for Sustainable Procurement, In 2018, the association created a working  group around the  issues presented  by  the Law on the Duty of Vigilance for procurement functions, following which a White Paper entitled 'Implementing adapted measures to manage the duty of vigilance  for  suppliers  and  subcontractors', offering best practices, methods and tools was published. Since 2021, Air  Liquide  has  been part of  the work group  on  climate  change launched by ObsAR. https://www.obsar.asso.fr/).",

MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe implementation  of  the Sustainable  Procurement  procedure, and in particular the results of the Sustainability-Critical Suppliers' assessments, is monitored by the Procurement Department.\n\nIn 2022, of the 1,177 Sustainability-Critical Suppliers, the assessment and action plans campaign addressed 561 of them:\n\n- \u25a0 476 suppliers were invited to answer a questionnaire (4) . 341 of them (72%) were assessed (63% by the external platform and 37% by Air Liquide using an internal questionnaire);\n- \u25a0 20  non-compliant suppliers were  invited  to set up corrective action plans. 19 of them prepared and completed action plans.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 assessment campaign, 78% of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers had a valid score (i.e. not requiring a reassessment as per paragraph 5.2.2). Other suppliers are being monitored.\n\nThe results of the assessment by the external platform show that the average of the current score is 47/100 for SustainabilityCritical Suppliers.  The  highest scores  are  on human  rights and working conditions, with an average of 51/100. The lowest rating concerns the sustainable procurement  procedures  implemented by suppliers with an average of 39/100.\n\n- \u25a0 65 suppliers needing improvement were invited to set up corrective action plans. 56 of them have prepared action plans;\n\n| Key indicators                                                                                             | 2022 Objectives   | 2022 Results   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| Share of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers addressed by the annual assessment campaign  who responded      | 65%               | 72%            |\n| Share of suppliers needing improvement who prepared a corrective action plan  (annual assessment campaign) | 82%               | 86%            |\n| Share of non-compliant suppliers who prepared and implemented a corrective action plan                     | 100%              | 95%            |\n\nIn 2022, the number of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers amounts to 1,177, compared to 1,007 in 2021, an increase of 17%. This base of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers has been expanded by improving the tools allowing their identification. The objectives and results  for the year 2022, expressed as a  percentage,  show  a decrease compared to 2021. However, the results in absolute terms are increasing. Indeed, if the share of Sustainability-Critical Suppliers addressed by the assessment campaign who responded is 72% in 2022 against 83% in 2021, their number was 341 in 2022 against 249 in 2021, which is 37% more.\n\n## 6. Whistleblowing system\n\n## 6.1. COLLECTION AND TREATMENT OF ALERTS\n\n## 6.1.1.  Ethics whistleblowing system\n\nAir Liquide's Whistleblowing Policy defines the different channels a whistleblower may use to lodge an alert on any potential violation of the Group's ethics commitments and rules. It also describes how these alerts are handled by Air Liquide. This policy was updated at  the  end  of  2022 to  ensure compliance with  the new applicable regulations on whistleblower protection. It is available for all employees in the BlueBook (5) and is available on the Group's Website for external stakeholders ( https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics).\n\nSince 2015, the Group has had in all its entities a whistleblowing system, EthiCall (https://www.safecall.co.uk/en/clients/ethicall/) for all Group companies. Access to this system was extended at the end of 2021, after consultation with employee representative bodies  in  France.  It  is  now  available to  all internal and external\n\nFollowing the assessment results and a review of corrective action plans, Air Liquide suspended its sales relationship with five suppliers during 2022.\n\nThese performance indicators and their progress report are regularly presented the the Group Procurement Management Committee, which bring together the Hubs and the World Business Units Procurement directors.\n\nstakeholders (customers, patients, suppliers, subcontractors and their staff, local communities, facilitators, etc.) of the Group. Airgas and its subsidiaries also have a similar platform, EthicsPoint ( Anyone can lodge an alert in their own language by telephone or via dedicated websites (alerts are collected by service providers). https://secure.ethicspoints.com/domain/media/en/ gui/28723/index.html).\n\nThe alerts may relate to allegations of existing or reasonably suspected ethical breaches or misconduct that may be very likely to  occur  in  relation to  the  Group's  activities.  For  example,  alerts may relate to  any breach of the Group Code of Conduct and internal procedures, to any violation of applicable laws and in particular to any conduct or situation contrary to the Group's commitments in terms of:\n\n- \u25a0 human rights;\n- \u25a0 health and safety of persons;\n- \u25a0 environment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Vigilance Plan\n\nFor employees, this system is complementary to the usual channels  for reporting  possible  incidents  within the  entities  (line management, Human Resources Department, Ethics Correspondent, Group Ethics Officer). Third parties can also raise their concerns to their contact person within the Group. The whistleblowing  system enables  rapid  and structured  handling  of reports received. Air Liquide communicates regularly to its employees (e.g. via posters, Intranet, reminder in the annual and mandatory e-learning relating to the Code of Conduct, managerial communication, induction training for new hires).\n\nOnce an alert is collected, it is processed confidentially and objectively by the competent person within Air Liquide, depending on the category and geographical origin of the report. After reviewing the admissibility of an alert in accordance with internal procedures, the person responsible for the alert treatment conducts an investigation to determine whether the reported facts are true, and may call on external resources for this investigation. When appropriate, the investigator proposes the associated corrective and/or remediation measures. Follow-up and feedback should be provided to the whistleblower no later than three months (but  to the  extent possible within  two  months) from the acknowledgment of receipt of the alert. In certain justified cases (for example, due to the nature or complexity of the alert), a longer period may be necessary (but this period should not exceed three additional months).\n\nAppropriate corrective and remedial measures may include:\n\n- \u25a0 the strengthening of Group policies, controls and processes;\n- \u25a0 Human Resources or other type of assistance to the whistleblower;\n- \u25a0 individual or collective awareness-raising;\n- \u25a0 sanctions.\n\nThe most serious cases are reviewed by an Ethics Committee at the relevant hub or World Business Unit level, or by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe principles concerning the protection granted to whistleblowers (anonymity of the whistleblower, respect for the confidentiality of the alert treatment, prohibition of any form of retaliation) are affirmed  in the  Code  of  Conduct and  the  Group Whistleblowing Policy. The Group guarantees that any whistleblower who has in good  faith reported  an  ethical  breach or  misconduct  will not  be subject to any disciplinary or discriminatory measures or retaliation of any kind.\n\n## 6.1.2.  Safety and security event reporting process\n\nUrgent situations in terms of health, safety or security, or the most serious accidents cannot be processed by the ethics whistleblowing system. The Safety and Industrial System Department has an internal reporting process for security or safety incidents, which makes it possible to inform the management chain and the relevant security or safety managers of the subsidiary, cluster, hub and Group very quickly, depending on the severity. A crisis management and incident monitoring process is therefore implemented to ensure the best care of any victims,  secure  the  situation  and  establish  an  investigation  team which is both qualified and adapted to the incident. Subsidiaries regularly report all safety and security events in the Group's reporting tool. This tool was replaced at the beginning of 2021 by a new tool that improves both the quality of the information reported and the monitoring of corrective action plans.\n\n## 6.1.3.  Process for the protection of personal data\n\nFor personal data, Air Liquide has deployed specific tools to collect  requests  for the  exercise  of  rights  and to  report  possible violations of personal data. A form is available on the Air Liquide website ( to be put in contact with the services in charge of the protection of DCP. In addition, Air Liquide has signed a contract with a company responsible for finding and reporting personal data that is illegitimately accessible via  the Internet.  These  requests  and reports are recorded in  a dedicated register. https://contactprivacy.airliquide.com/)\n\n## 6.2. MONITORING SCHEME OF MEASURES IMPLEMENTED AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS\n\nThe whistleblowing system is supervised by the Group Ethics Officer, who ensures a compliant implementation, and in particular that it  is  properly disseminated throughout the Group, that alerts are processed appropriately, and whistleblowers are protected. The  Group Ethics  Officer reports  back  to  the Group  Ethics and Compliance Committee and to the Audit and Accounts Committee of the Board of Directors on the main indicators and lessons learned from this system.\n\nIn 2022, 287 alerts were reported in the whistleblowing system.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF ALERTS PER GEOGRAPHY (number / %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF ALERTS PER NATURE (number / %)\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 66 alerts were still in process of treatment. 27% of alerts received in 2022 were found to be justified  following  investigation  and  led  to  corrective  remediation measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA presentation of the whistleblowing system and its main results is shared each year with the employee representatives of L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\nIn addition, in 2022, Air Liquide recorded 50 requests throughout the Group for the exercise of rights or reports of violations of personal data.",

        "page_content": "## GOVERNANCE - COMPOSITION, FUNCTIONING AND WORK OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES\n\n## 1. Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed that, in keeping with the Group's previous practices, the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance for listed companies is the Code to which the Company voluntarily  refers.  This Code in  its updated  version  is available on the website https://afep.com/wp-content/ uploads/2022/12/Code-AFEP-MEDEF-version-dedecembre-2022.pdf.\n\nThe Appointments and Governance Committee and the Remuneration Committee reviewed current practices in the Company with respect to the AFEP/MEDEF Code as amended in December 2022. The Company considers that its practices comply with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code and no points appear in the summary table (see below, paragraph \"Application of  the AFEP/MEDEF  Corporate Governance Code: summary table\" -page 159) established under the 'Apply or Explain' rule provided  for  by article  L. 22-10-10 of the  French Commercial Code,  and referred  to  in  article 28.1 of the  AFEP/ MEDEF Code of December 2022.\n\nThe Report of the Haut Comit\u00e9 de gouvernement d'entreprise (French High Committee on Corporate Governance) of November 2022 and the French financial market authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s  Financiers) Report on  Corporate Governance and the remuneration of Executive Officers of listed companies published in December 2022 were reviewed by each of the Committees concerned, which then made a report to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe principles governing the professional ethics of Directors, the diversity policy which applies to the Board of Directors, together with the composition, role and rules of operation of the Board and its  Committees are defined in the internal regulations. The latter was last amended by successive decisions of the Board of Directors in November 2022 and February 2023 in order in particular  to  further  specify  the  duties  of  the Audit  and Accounts Committee, the Environment and Society Committee, and the joint session between these two Committees, and to take into account the AFEP/MEDEF Code updates  (see details  in  paragraphs  9.3 and 10.1 - respectively pages 151 and 154 of this Document).\n\nThe internal regulation updated version is published in full on the Company's website: https://www.airliquide.com/sites/airliquide. com/files/2023-02/internal-regulations-of-the-board-of-directors\\_february-2023.pdf.\n\n## 2. Governance structure\n\nAir Liquide's governance is historically defined by an effort to remain relevant to the Group's challenges, to respect Shareholders' rights, to balance powers and to ensure best practices evolve.\n\n## 2.1. CURRENT METHOD OF GOVERNANCE: SEPARATION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nSince June 1, 2022,  the governance of L'Air Liquide S.A. is  a governance with a Board of Directors with separation of the functions of Chairman of the Board of  Directors from those of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board of Directors' meeting of May 4, 2022, at the close of the General Meeting, acting unanimously and in accordance with the recommendations of the Appointments and Governance Committee, chose to adopt this method of governance, effective June 1, 2022, and to appoint Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as new Chief Executive Officer and to renew the duties of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Chairman of  the Board of  Directors  (see  paragraph 2.2  in  this section, pages 137 to 138, for details of the succession). On this occasion, the Board of Directors also decided to maintain the position of Lead Director.\n\n## 2.1.1.  Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs  an Executive  Officer,  the Chief Executive  Officer who alone oversees and manages the operations of the Company, is invested with the broadest powers to act in all  circumstances in the Company's name subject to certain decisions to be submitted to  prior  authorization  of the Board of Directors as established in the articles of association and described in the internal regulations (see below).\n\n## Limits on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn accordance with  article 13  of the  articles of association, the decisions subject to the prior authorization of the Board of Directors  are  defined  in the  internal  regulations of the  Board  of Directors.",

Creation of pledges or security by the Company for an individual amount in excess of 80 million euros or for an annual cumulative amount in excess of 150 million euros.\n- d. Concerning the Group: (i) commitments to invest in or (ii) acquire equity investments or assets, consisting of immoveable or moveable property, tangible or intangible, which will be listed under 'Fixed Assets' on the balance sheet, or to subscribe to share capital increases for an individual amount in excess of 250 million euros or for an annual cumulative amount in excess of 400 million euros.\n- The Board will be informed of operations for an individual amount in excess of 250 million euros, involving (i) purchases relating to items that cannot be listed under 'Fixed Assets' on the balance sheet, such as electricity or natural gas purchases, and (ii) the sale to third parties of engineering or construction goods and services, such information being provided if possible ex ante, and in any case ex post.\n\nApprovals of programs for investments by successive 'tier' shall be requested from the Board of Directors.\n\n- e. Any financing operation concerning the Group for an amount likely to substantially alter the Group's financial structure.\n- f. Operations likely to substantially alter the Group strategy as determined by the Board of Directors.\n\nIt  is specified  that  when the  Board of  Directors' authorization  is required due to  one of  the overall annual ceilings set  in this paragraph being exceeded, the Board of Directors may, if it considers it appropriate, renew its authorization for all or part of the authorized amount initially granted.\n\nMoreover, in the event of a fundamental modification of the Group's information system leading to an investment exceeding an amount of 250 million euros, the Board of Directors will be given prior information.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, Chief Executive Officer, is also a Director of L'Air Liquide S.A. In this capacity, he participates in the discussions and deliberations of the Board of Directors.\n\n## 2.1.2.  Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors organizes and manages the work of the Board of Directors and reports on such work to the General Meeting. He is responsible for calling meetings of the Board of Directors. He sets the dates and agenda for Board meetings, manages the conduct of the meetings themselves and leads their discussions.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors is in charge of the smooth running of the Company's bodies. His role includes ensuring that Directors are able to accomplish their tasks. As part of this, he makes sure that they have all of the available information necessary to accomplish them effectively.\n\nWithin a context of continuity, given Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's long experience as head of Air Liquide and his in-depth knowledge of the Group, he has been entrusted by the  Board of Directors, for  the duration  of the  managerial  transition, which  is,  at this  stage,  expected  to correspond to the duration of his term of office, with specific tasks over and above those legally conferred on the Chairman of the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Governance - Composition, functioning and work of the Board of Directors and Committees\n\nThese duties, carried out in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, described in the internal regulations of the Board of Directors, are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the Chairman is involved in major decisions concerning the definition of the Group's overall strategy and organization;\n- \u25a0 the Chairman may, at the Chief Executive Officer's request, attend internal meetings with management on these topics in order to shed light on the strategic issues;\n- \u25a0 the Chairman may, in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer, represent the Group (pursuant to an institutional role) vis-\u00e0-vis the public authorities and some strategic partners and/or stakeholders;\n- \u25a0 the Chairman may, in close collaboration with the Chief Executive Officer, meet with the principal shareholders on governance matters, in addition to more specific matters, as agreed with the Chief Executive Officer. He shall keep the Chief Executive Officer informed. He monitors the Group's shareholder strategy and continues to chair the Shareholders' Communication Committee;\n- \u25a0 the Chairman makes his experience available to the Group and ensures that the Group's values and culture are upheld.\n\nThe Chairman attends the meetings of the Appointments and Governance Committee and the Remuneration Committee. He plays an  active  role  in  the  recruitment  of  Directors  led by  the Appointments  and  Governance  Committee.The Chairman reports to  the Board on the performance of his responsibilities.\n\n## 2.1.3.  Report on the activities of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nAs set out in the internal regulations, the Chairman reported to the Board on the performance of his duties during the past fiscal year, in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of Directors from June 1 to December 31, 2022.\n\nDuring  this  period and in  addition to the traditional  duties of  a Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier took part in numerous events organized by the public authorities  at  national and European levels to represent the Group (as part of his institutional representation missions), such as the Franco-German meetings in  Evian  and  the  meetings  in Aix en Provence (where Mr Beno\u00eet Potier gave a presentation on the subject 'Finding the decarbonization trajectory'). He also represents Air Liquide in organizations dealing with subjects relevant to the Group: he cochairs the  National Hydrogen Council, and regularly  participates as a member in the meetings of the Hydrogen Council, ERT (European Round Table) and the Asia Business Council.\n\nIn 2022, in addition to the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, which remains a privileged moment for exchange between the Chairman and the Shareholders, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier took part  in  events that enabled him to meet personally individual shareholders: in particular a 'Post-General Meeting' session held in Lille on May 12, 2022, and the inauguration of the Shareholder Lounge at the Company's head office with Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in November 2022. Furthermore, the Individual Shareholder Communication Committee, chaired  by the  Chairman  of the  Board  of  Directors, met three times in 2022.\n\nAs  part  of the  meetings  with  investors  that  are  organized every year, the Chairman also met with three major shareholders in 2022 to discuss governance issues.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier also took part in the recruitment of new Directors overseen by the Appointments and Governance Committee - see below paragraph 3.1 -pages 138 to 139. As the search for candidates is carried out  in  accordance with  Air Liquide's  own criteria, the Chairman of the Board of Directors shared his indepth knowledge of the  Group's  business  lines  and  culture  with the Committee.\n\n## 2.2. METHOD OF GOVERNANCE PRIOR TO JUNE 1, 2022 (COMBINATION OF THE ROLES OF CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER) - WORK RELATED TO THE SUCCESSION\n\nBetween May 2006 and May 2022, the Board of Directors had set up a mode of governance combining the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, exercised by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier.\n\nAt the  time  of the  successive renewals of  the term of office  of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier (the last one having taken place in May 2018), the Board of Directors considered this mode of governance  as being the most appropriate. The members of the Board, as part of the annual assessment of its operations, considered that the powers  in  place within  the existing  governance functioned in  a balanced manner, with in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 the presence of a Lead Director with specific prerogatives and powers;\n- \u25a0 the composition of the Board of Directors ensuring the preponderance of independent Directors and a balance of skills and nationalities;\n- \u25a0 the presence of specialized committees, including the Appointments and Governance Committee, responsible in particular for ensuring the proper functioning of the management bodies;\n- \u25a0 a balanced organization of interactions between the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  non-executive  Directors and the members of the Executive Committee.\n\n## Succession\n\nFollowing the work carried out from 2018, the Appointments and Governance Committee defined a succession plan including the choice of governance structure considered  most appropriate for the Company, and examined the selection of the candidate who would succeed Mr Beno\u00eet Potier to the Executive Management.\n\nAs part  of this  work,  the  Committee  reviewed  and  analyzed  the Group's main talent and selected candidates exhibiting the required skills and qualities most suited to the Group's future challenges.  A study of the evolution of the  chosen candidates' careers and their achievements in their managerial responsibilities was  conducted by the Committee  throughout  the process.  The Committee decided that, in light of the quality of profiles examined, an internal candidate should be prioritized. The Committee decided that the skills, depth of experience and personal qualities of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow made him the best candidate to succeed Mr Beno\u00eet Potier. As a result, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's appointment was recommended to the Board of Directors with the full consent of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier.",

The Board wished the Group to continue to benefit from Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's unparalleled experience following his 20 years at the Company's  helm, his commitment to promoting the Group's culture and values, his governance expertise founded on transparency and close ties with the Company's Shareholders. The term of office of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Director was renewed by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nWithin this context of continuity, given Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's long experience as head of Air Liquide and his in-depth knowledge of the Group, he has been entrusted for the duration of the managerial transition, which is, at this stage, expected to correspond to the duration of his term of office, with specific tasks over  and  above  those legally  conferred  on  the Chairman of the Board of Directors -see above, paragraphs 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, pages 136 and 137.\n\nThe Board,  having deemed the  qualities  of Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow in line with the Group's performance and development strategy, decided, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, to appoint him as Chief Executive Officer. Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow was also appointed as a Director by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nAt the close of this same Meeting, the Board of Directors appointed Mr Xavier Huillard as Lead Director and decided to retain him in this position in the context of the entry into force of the new separate governance on June 1, 2022. The Board, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, also appointed Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow as Chief Executive Officer and reappointed Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThis new governance came into force on June 1, 2022.\n\n## 3. Composition of the Board of Directors\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS as of 12/31/2022\n\n12 members\n\n| INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS  (a)   | DIRECTORS  REPRESENTING  THE EMPLOYEES   |   PARITY  (a) | NATIONALITIES   | AVERAGE LENGTH  OF PRESENCE  ON THE BOARD   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| 80 % 2                       | 50 %                                     |             4 |                 | 6 years                                     |\n\n(a) Directors representing the employees are not taken into account for the calculation of this percentage.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Board of Directors comprised twelve members: ten members appointed by the General Meeting, four of whom are foreign nationals (German, American and British) and five are women, and two Directors represent the employees.\n\nAs indicated in the table on pages 132 to 133, experience in the fields  of  industry,  services, research  and  innovation,  healthcare, chemicals and the  construction professions are represented on the Board. The Directors also bring cross-functional skills such as finance,  CSR and  digital,  as  well as  the vision of managers  of large international groups.\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors reviews its composition so that it  reflects a diversity of profiles, experience and skills adapted to the Group's challenges.\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code, the internal regulations  provide  for a maximum of four  other  terms  of  office held within French or foreign listed companies for non-Executive Directors. This number is reduced to two other terms of office for Executive Directors  of  the Company. Moreover,  an  obligation  to provide information on the terms of office held in other companies, including their participation on the Board Committees of such companies, is provided for non-Executive Directors. In this context, the Board of Directors was informed of the appointment of Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger as a member of the Curie Institute Supervisory Board.\n\nBesides, an obligation to ask for the opinion of the Board of Directors (which makes a decision on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee) before accepting a new corporate office in a listed company is also provided for the Company's Officers.\n\n## 3.1. DIVERSITY POLICY - SELECTION OF NEW MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'The members are chosen for their skills, their integrity, their independence  of mind  and their determination  to take into account the interests of all shareholders.'\n\n' Diversity policy concerning the Board of Directors: the composition of the Board of Directors, with regard to its members appointed by the General Meeting upon the proposal of the Board of Directors, shall reflect diversity and complementarity of experience, in particular international experience, nationalities, age, gender, cultures and expertise, including a significant number of executive managers or former executive managers; the Board of Directors shall look for persons possessing skills in the following areas: marketing,  services, industry,  finance,  healthcare,  research, technology and corporate social responsibility.'\n\nThe diversity policy which applies to the members of the Board is accompanied by guidelines, which are set  forth in the internal regulations  which,  although not  written in  stone,  also  guide the composition of the Board, in particular in terms of the number of Directors appointed by the General Meeting (in principle 10 and 12), the  duration  of  the terms  of office (four years, principle  of staggering renewals, the proportion of members appointed by the General Meeting in office for more than 12 years cannot exceed one-third), age or the proportion of members who qualify as independent, thus aiming to comply with the recommended principles in terms of good Corporate Governance practices.",

New independent Directors are appointed according to the steps described below (summarized in the internal regulations of the Board of Directors):\n\n## PROFILE\n\n## APPLICATIONS\n\n## SELECTION\n\n## DECISION\n\nDefinition of the profile sought by the Appointments and Governance Committee with regard to:\n\n- \u25a0 sought-after skills and experience in accordance with the Board's diversity policy;\n- \u25a0 sought-after professional and personal qualities; and\n- \u25a0 gender parity.\n\nThe Board of Directors considers that compliance with the criteria included in the diversity policy contributes to the quality of its discussions, and that the diversity of its members, particularly in terms  of  gender,  age, nationality  and experience, contributes  to optimizing results in terms of environmental and societal sustainability.\n\nIn  accordance with the criteria defined in the diversity policy set forth above, the Appointments and Governance Committee conducted a search for candidates with an excellent knowledge of the American and Asian markets and, in general, profiles with relevant and complementary experience: financial, CSR, digital and technological skills, experience as leading business executives, etc.\n\nThe CSR skill,  which  is  already  well  represented  on  the Board, notably by some members who are or have been in senior management positions in  large  groups,  with experience  of  CSR transformation plans, will be reinforced by the appointment of new members with this skill (see below).\n\nThis work led the Committee to recommend that the Board submit to  the  General  Meeting of  May  3,  2023  the  appointment  of  four new Directors : Ms Catherine Guillouard, Ms Christina Law, Mr  Alexis Perakis-Valat and Mr Michael H.  Thaman (see their individual profiles at pages 172 to 175 and the draft resolutions for these appointments at pages 454 to 455). Moreover, in light of Ms Anette Bronder's resignation (see  pages  132 to  133  and page 150), the Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors coopt a female candidate for the remaining period of Ms  Anette Bronder's term  of office.  The  Board of Directors thus  co-opted Ms Monica de Virgiliis  as Director  (see  Ms  Monica  de Virgiliis's individual profile at page 176 and the corresponding draft resolution for ratification of this co-option at pages 454 to 455).\n\nThe Board ensured that the number of mandates held by the new Directors, which complies with the law, the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance and  the internal  regulations would allow them to  have  the required availability  to  participate  actively and diligently to the work of the Board and the Committees. It is specified that  in order  to  take into account  the policy  of  certain investors limiting more strictly the number of offices held in listed companies by non-executive corporate officers, a candidate  has taken the necessary measures to reduce the number of her other mandates in listed companies (1) .\n\n- \u25a0 Discussions within the Committee concerning the candidates: adequacy with the needs identified, verification of the rules of the AFEP/MEDEF Code (multiple offices, independence, etc.).\n- \u25a0 Individual meeting with the Chairman of the Committee, the Chairman of the Board and with each member.\n- \u25a0 Conclusion and recommendation to the Board of Directors.\n\nIf the General Meeting of shareholders adopts the resolutions submitted to it, five new independent Directors will have seats on the Board of Directors at  the close of  that Meeting (for further information on the independence of the candidates, see paragraph 3.2, on pages 139 to 142 of this Document).\n\n## 3.2. INDEPENDENCE OF BOARD MEMBERS\n\nBased on the full definition of independence set out in the AFEP/ MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, the internal regulations define the criteria applied within the Company to assess the independence of a Board member.\n\n'A member of the Board of Directors is independent when he/ she has  no relationship of any  kind with  the Company, its Group or its management which may interfere with  his/her freedom to exercise his/her judgment.\n\nIn  this  spirit,  the  criteria  which  may  provide  guidance  to  the Board in order to classify a member as independent will be as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 he/she is not and has never been an employee or member of the Executive Management of the Company;\n- \u25a0 he/she does not hold office as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman or member of the Management Board of a company in which the Chairman of the Board of Directors,  the  Chief  Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President of Air Liquide is a Director or member of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u25a0 he/she must not have any business relations with the Air Liquide Group which represent a significant part of the business activities of (i) the company of which the Director is a member of the Executive Management or (ii) Air Liquide;\n- \u25a0 he/she does not have any close family links with the Chief Executive Officer or a Senior Executive Vice President;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must not  have been an  auditor of the  Company during the previous five years;\n- \u25a0 he/she  must not have  been a member  of the  Board of Directors (or Supervisory Board) of the Company for more than 12 years.'\n\n- \u25a0 Profile searches carried out by the Committee, as the case may be, with the help of a recruitment firm.\n- \u25a0 In-depth study by the Committee of the profiles identified.\n- \u25a0 Establishment of a list of potential candidates.\n- \u25a0 Approval by the Board of the draft resolution relating to the appointment of the new Director to be submitted to the General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In reliance on the work of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors  reviews  each  of the criteria contained in the Board's internal regulations and in the AFEP/MEDEF Code for assessing the independence of each Director.\n\nThe Air Liquide Group is particularly attentive to conflicts of interest and even potential conflicts of interest. To determine whether or not the business relationship is material, for each Director or candidate for these positions, criteria such as the following are examined:\n\n- \u25a0 the  percentage of  worldwide business volumes between the Air Liquide Group and each group in which an Air Liquide Director (or candidate for the position of Director) holds a corporate office or a management position. The percentage of business  volume is assessed  for both  the Air  Liquide  Group and each group concerned;\n- \u25a0 the economic dependence;\n- \u25a0 the exclusivity;\n- \u25a0 the participation of the Director in the business relationship.\n\nThe Board relies on a summary table of the flows (purchases and sales) that took place during the past fiscal year between the Air Liquide Group and the group within which an Air Liquide Director appointed by the  General  Meeting  (or  a candidate  proposed for these functions) also holds a corporate office or an executive function -on this point, see the information relating to the positions and functions held by the Directors on pages 160 to 176. Such figures are weighed against the total purchases and sales of each group to measure their significance.\n\nFor the 2022 fiscal  year, this chart shows that the  amounts  of sales by the Air Liquide Group to any of the relevant groups or of its purchases from any such groups never exceed 1% of the total sales or  purchases  by  the Air  Liquide  Group or by any  of the relevant groups.\n\nBeyond the quantitative criteria mentioned above, the qualitative review conducted by the Board of Directors led to the conclusion that neither Air Liquide nor the groups concerned are in a relationship of economic dependence or exclusivity, as these are large international groups with very diversified activities.\n\nIn addition, in light of the highly decentralized organization of the Air Liquide Group, its size, the diversity of its businesses, which are, for the most part, extremely local, and its broad geographical presence, the relevant Directors do not become involved in business relations which are conducted, within the Air Liquide Group, entirely by  the managers  of the  relevant hubs, clusters (groups of countries/entities) and countries. After a review of each individual situation, the Board concluded that none of the Directors has to exercise a direct or indirect decision-making power in the contractual negotiations leading to the business affairs discussed. If this were not the case, he/she would have to declare a conflict of interest to the Board. This matter would then be addressed in accordance with the ethical rules provided for in the internal regulations.\n\nAs  a  result of  the review carried  out,  it was  concluded  that no group in which a Director of Air Liquide (or a candidate for such a position) holds a corporate office or a management position has a significant business relationship with the Air Liquide Group.",

The criteria used are very largely inspired by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance. The Board continues to consider, however, that the Company's former employees or officers cannot be deemed to be independent even if they ceased to hold office more than five years ago .\n\nFurther  to  the  recommendation  made by the French financial  market  authority,  a table  showing  the  list  of  Directors  in  2022  who are considered to be independent in light of the criterion provided for in the internal regulations and the AFEP/MEDEF Code is set out below.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 Independence of the Directors elected by the General Meeting in light of the criteria in the\n\n|                                                          | Internal regulations   | AFEP/MEDEF Code   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Beno\u00eet Potier  - Chairman of the Board of Directors      | No                     | No                |\n| Fran\u00e7ois Jackow  - Chief Executive Officer               | No                     | No                |\n| Xavier Huillard  - Lead Director                         | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Genevi\u00e8ve Berger                                         | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Anette Bronder                                           | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Bertrand Dumazy                                          | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Aiman Ezzat                                              | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones                                       | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Kim Ann Mink                                             | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Annette Winkler                                          | Yes                    | Yes               |\n| Philippe Dubrulle  - Director representing the employees | N/A                    | N/A               |\n| Fatima Tighlaline  - Director representing the employees | N/A                    | N/A               |",

Pursuant  to the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, Mr Philippe Dubrulle and Ms Fatima Tighlaline, Directors representing the employees, were not taken into account when calculating this ratio.\n\nGiven the new composition of the Board of Directors following the Combined General Meeting  of  May  3,  2023,  and subject  to  the approval of the proposed resolutions concerning new Directors, all qualified as independent by the Board of Directors, the percentage  of  Independent Directors on the Board  of  Directors would be 83%.\n\n## 3.3. PROFESSIONAL ETHICS OF DIRECTORS - RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe internal regulations summarize the main obligations imposed on Directors.  The Director represents all the shareholders and shall act in all circumstances in the Company's corporate interest.\n\nEach Director undertakes to meet the obligations imposed upon him/her by the articles of association and the various legal, regulatory or internal Company provisions and, more specifically, the internal rules relating to the prevention of market abuse or the obligations to report transactions in the Company's shares. Each Director is bound by an obligation of secrecy. The members of the Audit Committee are, in particular, bound by an obligation of confidentiality concerning the information relating to the services performed by the Statutory Auditors, in accordance with the legal conditions. Each Director shall endeavor to take part in all meetings of the Board and the Committees of which he/she is a member, and attend the General Meetings.\n\nThe  information required by the AFEP/MEDEF  Code  concerning  the level  of  individual attendance of the  members  of the  Board  of Directors is shown in the following table:\n\n|                                                            | Board of Directors   | Audit and  Accounts  Committee   | Appointments  and Governance  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   | Environment  and Society  Committee   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Beno\u00eet Potier                                              |                      |                                  |                                           |                           |                                       |\n| Chairman of the Board of Directors                         | 100%                 | -

Role and tasks of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the orientations of the Company's activities and ensures their implementation, in line with  its corporate  interest, by taking into account the social and environmental stakes of its activity . Accordingly, it examines and approves, based on proposals from the Company's Executive Management, the main points of the Group's strategy (in principle between three and five year objectives), including the multi-annual points of strategy concerning corporate social responsibility. It ensures the implementation of these orientations by the Executive Management.\n\nThe Board of Directors regularly reviews, in connection with the strategy which it has defined, opportunities and the financial, legal, operational,  social and environmental risks,  together with the measures taken accordingly. It ensures that a system has been implemented for the prevention and detection of corruption and influence peddling.\n\nSubject to the powers attributed to the General Meetings and within the limit of the corporate purpose, the Board deals with any issue concerning the smooth running of the Company and manages corporate business pursuant to its decisions. The internal regulations stipulate that the specific powers vested in the Board of  Directors  include,  in  particular,  the choice of  Company Officers, the determination of their remuneration and setting of the terms and conditions governing their employment and performance of their duties in accordance with current regulations; the appointment of the Lead Director; the convening of the General Meeting (and determination of the agenda and draft resolutions within this scope); the preparation of the financial statements and Annual Management Report (including the Extrafinancial Performance Declaration and the Vigilance Plan) and the Corporate Governance report; the definition of the Group's gender policy in leaderships; establishing its proper rules for functioning (formation of Committees, breakdown of Directors' annual remuneration, and more). In addition, the Board of Directors may also decide or authorize simple bond issues.\n\nThe Board also exercises the powers delegated to it by the General Meeting, particularly with regard to the granting of stock options or award of performance shares, issues of marketable securities, share buyback or employee savings programs.\n\nThe Board of Directors ensures that the Executive Management implements a non-discrimination and diversity policy, notably concerning balanced gender representation within the Group's leaderships. Acting on a proposal by Executive Management, the Board sets the diversity targets for the Group's leaderships. Executive Management makes a submission to the Board on how the targets will be implemented, together with an action plan and schedule for completion. Executive Management reports its results to the Board every year.\n\nIn this context, the Board of Directors, at its meeting in February 2023, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, noted the progress made in 2022 in connection with the targets for 2025, namely 35% women at the managers and professionals level and 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women. At this meeting, the Board of Directors also noted the changes made in 2022 within the framework of the objectives set for the Executive Committee for 2026. These objectives, which are incorporated into the nondiscrimination and diversity policy, are set out in detail on pages 351, 352 and 400 of this Universal Registration Document and are supplemented by information relating to the manner in which the Company tries to obtain a balanced representation of women and men on this Committee. The results  concerning the  gender mix with regard to the 10% of positions which carry the most responsibility can also be found on pages 351 and 400.",

Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nInforming the Directors: the internal regulations define the methods for informing the  Directors.  They  specify, in particular, that  prior  to Board meetings, a file  of meeting documentation is sent out  to  Board members covering  the  items on  the  agenda. Files are provided in electronic form on a dedicated platform. The Chief Executive Officer (or the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, where appropriate), assisted, if need be, by members of the management teams, presents to the Board of Directors a quarterly report on the Company's management, the draft annual and interim financial statements and the various issues requiring the Board's authorization or opinion. For major substantive issues (major  projects,  M&A\u2026), a very  detailed  summary is  prepared. Any member of the Board of Directors may request any additional information he/she considers  necessary.  He/she makes such  a request to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nInteractions between the non-Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee are regular and take place during specific  presentations  made  at  meetings of the  Board  of Directors,  particularly  during the  meetings  on  strategy or  during Committee meetings, as well as outside of these meetings. They also meet with them during training sessions on the activities for which the members of the Executive Committee are responsible.\n\nThe Directors may ask to meet members of the Executive Committee at any time.\n\nConduct of meetings: the internal regulations define the frequency of meetings and the rules for convening meetings and for participation by video-conference or telecommunications. They provide, in particular, for the Lead Director's right to ask  for  a meeting of the Board of Directors to be convened with any specified agenda and also for the conditions of the executive session attended by the members of the Board of Directors without the presence of the Group's Executive Directors (or former Executive Directors)  or internal Directors and employee representatives, chaired by the Lead Director. The Statutory Auditors are also heard during the meetings to review the financial statements.\n\nDuring the meeting, a summary presentation of the items is then made, allowing considerable time for exchanges and discussions. The presentations give rise to questions and are followed by discussions.  A round-the-table discussion is systematically held concerning  the significant  points, before moving to vote  on the items on the agenda. Detailed written minutes are then sent to the members for their review and comments, before the approval of the Board of Directors at its next meeting.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  article  14  of  the  articles  of association, the Board of Directors, upon notice from the Chairman of the Board of Directors, may take certain decisions by written consultation of the Directors under the conditions provided for by the regulations in force.\n\nCreation of Committees: the internal regulations define the tasks and operating procedures for the four Board Committees (a description of the missions of the Committees' tasks is provided on pages 152, 155, 157 and 158).\n\nTraining measures: the internal regulations stipulate that training measures are offered to the Directors relating to the Company's businesses  and specific  features, in  particular  by means of site visits  or  meetings  with  senior  executives,  and  to  the  Company's Corporate Social Responsibility challenges (in particular concerning climate issues). In particular, training on the  Group's accounting,  financial,  extra-financial  and  operational  aspects, as well as training on aspects related to the Group's risks, are offered to members of the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\nEach year, the Directors are asked about their training requirements and a training request form is systematically proposed once a year to each Director. It consists of proposals for meetings with the heads of each of the major business lines and main central functions, and site visits. A form is also systematically proposed to new Directors, which  is  used  to  draw  up  a  training program adapted to the skills and individual experience of each new Director.\n\nWithin this  framework, the Directors may ask to  meet  Executive Committee members or ask for specific training for each business line, activity or geographical zone.\n\nIn 2022, Directors received training on topics related especially to finance, General Control, Healthcare / Europe Industry business lines, including a particular point concerning Digital in Healthcare, Industrial Merchant at Airgas in the United States, hydrogen, and on strategy, with the relevant Executive Committee members respectively. A presentation on 'Asia' was also made for certain Directors.\n\nMoroever, a specific training course on the latest  changes in CSR regulations and their impact on Directors'  responsibilities, presented by two external contributors, was attended by the members during the fourth quarter 2022. During this meeting, the new obligations were presented, particularly in terms of CSR reporting (regulatory framework, challenges and outlook), as well as the missions and responsibilities of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee and the Committee in charge of CSR aspects. At the end of the presentations, time was devoted to discussions in a questions and answers session. In addition, as part of the training offered to Directors, specific CSR training is followed each year by Directors who so request with the member of the Executive Committee or the Business Head in charge. The CSR aspect is also systematically addressed, from an operational point of view, as part of training for the Group's various business lines.\n\nThe Directors representing the  employees may  receive  training relating to their rights and obligations as Directors, in accordance with the applicable regulations. This time is considered as actual working time and remunerated as such.\n\nThe breakdown  of the  trainings  carried out  in  2022  by  the two Directors representing the employees is stated on page 147 below.",

His term of office expired at the end of the General Meeting of May 2022. At its plenary meeting on December 16, 2021, the Group committee in France, in charge of appointing a Director representing the employees pursuant to the articles of association when the number of Directors (calculated according  to  article  L.  225-27-1-II  of  the  French  Commercial Code) is below or equal to eight, renewed Mr Philippe Dubrulle for  a  period  of four  years  which  will  expire  at the  end  of  the General Meeting called in 2026 to approve the 2025 financial statements.\n\nPursuant to the applicable regulations at the time of his appointment, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the  Board of  Directors  had defined the  amount of time  allocated to Mr  Philippe Dubrulle  for  the preparation of meetings of the Board of Directors and the Committees, and the training. Within this framework, in 2016, Mr Philippe Dubrulle had followed the training course provided by Sciences Po in partnership with  the  IFA  and  obtained  the Company Director's certificate.\n\nIn his capacity as a member of the Environment and Society Committee (since its creation in 2017), in addition to the training provided internally by  the member of the Executive Committee in charge of CSR aspects, in 2020 Mr Philippe Dubrulle attended a training on sustainability business models, organized by Centrale Supelec Exed.\n\nIn 2022, Mr Philippe Dubrulle took part in the training session organized on the Healthcare / Europe Industry business unit. Individual discussions were also organized on HR and strategy topics.\n\nAsked about his training intentions in 2022, he indicated that he wanted to subscribe to a magazine of current CSR topics this year in order to regularly update his knowledge and monitor developments on these topics on which he had already followed the in-depth training described above.\n\n- \u25a0 On October 1, 2020, the European Works Council appointed Ms Fatima Tighlaline as Director representing the employees. She has also been a member of the Remuneration Committee since May 2022.\n\nSince her appointment,  in accordance with  the  provisions  of the  PACTE Law and the Company's  articles of  association, Ms Fatima Tighlaline has participated in training sessions organized with members of the Executive Committee on specific areas. Ms Fatima Tighlaline also completed training in 2021 provided by Sciences  Po, in partnership  with the IFA, and obtained the Company Director's certificate.\n\nIn 2022, she notably attended a financial training course provided  by Air Liquide  University  and  as  part  of  training  on operational activities, took part in the training session organized on the Healthcare / Europe Industry business line.\n\nMoreover, in 2022, Ms Fatima Tighlaline and Mr Philippe Dubrulle completed the 'CSR regulations and Directors' responsibility' training course attended by all members of the Board of Directors - see details of this training in section 5 - page 146.\n\nThe Board of Directors, in compliance with the PACTE Law and the agreement  concluded  between the  various  stakeholders on December 10, 2021, defined the amount of time allocated to the Directors representing the employees for (i) the preparation of meetings of the Board of Directors (15 hours/meeting) and of the Committees which they are member of (5 hours/meeting) as well as (ii) training (40 hours/year on a cumulative basis over the length of the term of office).\n\nMr  Philippe  Dubrulle and Ms Fatima Tighlaline  sit on the  Board with a deliberative vote. They are subject to all of the provisions of the internal regulations governing the rights and obligations of the Directors.\n\nWithin the scope of the agreement entered into with the various stakeholders  and  pursuant  to the  provisions  in force  within the Group, which apply to  all the employees performing duties on Boards of Directors of the Group companies, it was agreed that employee Directors would not receive any remuneration.\n\n## 6.2.

Evaluation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'The Board will ensure that an evaluation is carried out periodically of its composition, its organization and its functioning as well as those of its Committees. An update will be made by the Board on this topic once a year and a formal evaluation will be carried out at least every three years. Within the scope of the evaluation of the Board, the Directors will, in  particular, be asked to state whether it appears to them to be necessary for the choice of the Company's general management organization to be re-examined.'\n\nAn evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors is carried out every year, alternating, one year, between a full appraisal questionnaire leading to a summary showing the replies and  the adoption of  recommendations  for  action and, the next year, a questionnaire aimed at making an assessment of the actions implemented in light of the recommendations made.\n\nDuring the evaluation conducted at the end of 2021, the members had  expressed their satisfaction  with the  actions  carried out, in particular the governance work surrounding the succession process  for  the Executive Management, the quality of  dialogue with the management team as well as with the Lead Director, and the quality of discussions within the Board and the Committees. Points envisaged related in particular to the future recruitments of an Asian member and an additional American member to the Board, continuing to increase meetings with the Executive Committee and top management (notably when presentations are made to the  Board),  and the  organization, when circumstances allow, of new 'deep dive' sessions on topical issues (such as took place at the September 2020 meeting which focused on hydrogen), as well as site  visits.  In  2022,  the Appointments  and Governance Committee stepped up its efforts to recruit new directors. Following this work, the appointment of an Asian candidate and an American candidate are proposed to the General Meeting  of  May 3, 2023.  The  presentations during the Board meetings in the second half of the year (focusing in particular on the strategy, the new company program, hydrogen, progress made in achieving the Group's ESG objectives, and human resources) were made by the members of the Executive Committee and the managers in charge of  these subjects and enabled rich discussions with the Board. An on-site Board meeting will be scheduled for a next fiscal year.\n\nThe Board of Directors decided to periodically call on an external consultant to assist in conducting these evaluations. A full evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees was carried out in 2022 with the help of an external service provider. In this regard, a full evaluation questionnaire was submitted to the members of the Board of Directors and individual interviews were held with this service provider.\n\nThe summary of responses to this full questionnaire, presented to the Board by the Appointments and Governance Committee Chair, at the start of 2023, reveals a very positive overall perception  of  the functioning of the  Board  and the  Committees. The members were unanimous in their praise for the quality of the Executive Management succession process, and consider that the new separate governance  mode  is working  very  well.  They commend the smooth relationship enjoyed by the Board with both the Executive Management and the Executive Committee. Finally, they emphasize the quality of the Environment and Society Committee's work and consider that CSR is very well integrated into the Group's global strategy. With regard to their expectations and future challenges, they stress the importance of regular updates with the Chief Executive Officer on the implementation of the strategic objectives, at the strategy meeting in the second half of the year, which could be the subject of an on-site meeting with a 'deep dive' into one of the Group's activities. They also wish to continue to make in-depth presentations,  during Board  strategy sessions, on current topics of relevance to the Group's business. Concerning  the composition of the Board, the  members stress how important it is to reinforce its  international  element  (notably given the importance of American and Asian markets for the Group) and to continue to attract the most relevant business and cross-functional skills, in view of the challenges facing the Group.\n\nIn light of the collegiate nature of the Board, the assessment questionnaire concentrates on the collective contribution of members to the Board operation. However, the questionnaire invites the Director to make an evaluation of the actual, individual contribution of Directors in the reflections of the Board of Directors. The contribution by each Director is assessed, furthermore, by the Appointments and Governance Committee and then by the Board of Directors at the time of renewal of the terms of office of Directors and Committee members.\n\n## 8. Meeting of the Board of Directors without the presence of the executive corporate officers\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code which recommend that at least one meeting per year is organized without the presence of the Executive Officers, the internal regulations stipulate that:\n\n'Once a year, the Lead Director calls a meeting of the members of the Board of Directors for a session to be held without the presence of  the  Group's  Executive Directors (or former Executive Directors) or internal Directors and employee representatives. He organizes and leads the discussions of this annual session which he chairs.'\n\nThe executive session is held at the close of a Board of Directors meeting for practical purposes and availability of members. In 2022, and in accordance with previous years, the executive session took  place  following the  Board of Directors'  meeting in November. During this session, members were able to review the work carried out over the entire fiscal year, as well as the implementation of the new governance.",

It  reviewed the draft  presentations  on the  financial  statements  for analysts. The Committee also ensured in particular that the specific climate risks were taken into account when preparing financial statements.\n\nIn addition, the Committee heard the presentations of the Statutory  Auditors  underlining  the key points  of  the results and took note of their conclusions.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the Committee reviewed the amount of  fees  paid to  the Statutory Auditors  in  respect  of  the  previous fiscal year.  The Audit  Committee  was also  informed  of  the  nonaudit services which were approved in 2022 within the scope of the approval procedure for the Group's non-audit services, which was validated by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee took due note  of  the  contents  of  the  three  draft reports  issued by the  Statutory  Auditors,  pursuant to European Regulation No. 537/2014. The reports on the statutory accounts and the consolidated statements include a description of the principal audit topics and are included in the Universal Registration Document while the third,  more detailed report, is intended for the Audit Committee only.\n\nThe Committee analyzed the  performance, monitored  efficiency programs, the Group's financing policy, debt and liquidity management, and investment and divestiture decisions. The Committee also monitored the impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on the Group's business and results as well as the risk management measures implemented.\n\nThe Committee monitored the transition between Ernst & Young and KPMG following the change of the Statutory Auditors in 2022.\n\nFurthermore,  during the  2022  fiscal year,  specific presentations were made to the Committee, notably covering the following points: (i) activities and execution of Engineering & Construction contracts, (ii) progress of digital asset protection actions, including those  concerning  operational/industrial information  systems and cyber risk management, (iii) digital in the Healthcare business, (iv) monitoring  of  changes  made  within  the  Shared  Service  Centers (CSP), (v) organization of procurement, (vi) activities in the field of biomethane and (vii) country risks (with extension to geopolitical aspects).\n\nThe Committee ensured compliance with the regulations on ethics and the prevention of corruption and influence peddling, notably in the context of  the review  of the  procedures in force within the Group and the monitoring of the actions required by the Sapin 2 Law.  The  Committee  also  ensured  compliance  with competition rules.\n\nThe Committee reviews on a regular basis the Group's activities relating to advocacy and lobbying and reports on them to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Committee heard  regular  reports on  the  main  assignments carried out by the Group Compliance and Control Department, the follow-up of any corrective actions taken and the Compliance and Control Department's main assignments for the forthcoming fiscal year. The Committee also regularly monitored the process for deployment of the risk management procedure within the Group. It reviewed the Group's risk map and its evolution. The Committee reviewed  the information  provided  in the Universal Registration Document concerning the  internal  control  and risk  management procedures and recommended its approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee is tasked with monitoring the management of the risks identified by the Group, even if particular attention is paid to accounting or financial risks; a methodology for the monitoring of each type of risk (including, in particular, the identification of the management and control bodies and procedures) and an appropriate time  scale (annual review or regular  review at less frequent intervals, depending on the type of risks) was defined.\n\nAt year-end, the Committee ensures that all of the risks identified on the risk map and subject to regular review have been examined by the Audit Committee according to the frequency specified. The work program prepared for the 2023 fiscal year is consistent with this approach. It was presented to the Board for discussion. In addition, the Committee discussed topics specifically presented at the Board of Directors meeting.\n\nThe Audit  and Accounts  Committee also  reviewed  for  2022 the conclusions based on implementation of the assessment procedure for  ordinary  agreements entered  into  on  arm's length terms. It is noted that, pursuant to the PACTE Law, this procedure provides a methodology for regularly assessing whether the agreements involving L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  that are not qualified as regulated agreements meet these conditions. This procedure also reminds the Group of the rules for classifying agreements entered into by  L'Air  Liquide  S.A.  as  either  regulated  agreements  or as ordinary agreements entered into on arm's length terms. Application  of  this procedure  during the  past  fiscal  year  did  not give rise to any reclassification of an ordinary agreement entered into on arm's length terms as a regulated agreement.\n\nSeveral days prior to each meeting, a file of meeting documentation, available in electronic form, is provided to Committee members on  a  dedicated platform. Each  Committee meeting is  preceded  by  a  preparatory meeting  attended  by the Committee Chair, assisted by the Committee Secretary, the Group Chief Financial Officer  and  the Group Control and Compliance Director. In order to prepare the meetings where financial statements are reviewed,  the Committee Chair meets with the Statutory Auditors, without the presence of the Company representatives. During the meeting, each presentation made by the Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Control Director, the senior executive specializing in the area under discussion, or the Statutory Auditors during the financial statement review meetings is followed by discussion.\n\nAn oral and then written report of each meeting is prepared for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee Chair receives summaries of the  internal audit reports.\n\nIn  addition,  after  presentation meetings  for  the accounts  for  the fiscal year, the Committee members can meet alone with the Statutory Auditors, without the presence of the Company representatives.\n\nAs recommended in the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance, the  following measures are taken so  that the  time during which the financial statements are available to be reviewed is sufficient: preparatory meeting with the Committee Chair more than one week prior to the meeting, as provided for above; files made available to Committee members five to seven days in advance. These measures enable the members to review the financial statements well in advance of the meeting. When compatible with the schedules of the members traveling from abroad, the Committee meetings relating to the financial statements are held the day before the Board meeting.",

This joint session, requested by the Directors in the Board's evaluation questionnaire, permits good interaction between the two Committees, in particular with regard to the review of  risks. The Audit  Committee shall review the Group's risks and related control procedures, including environmental and societal  risks,  which  are  examined  in  detail  by the  Environment and Society Committee. The joint session thus makes it possible for the members to discuss subjects which concern both the Committees.\n\nThe joint session  also  helps ensure a consistent approach,  as reflected in the  reconciliation  of  the  financial and  extra-financial data in the Integrated Management Report.\n\nDuring the joint session of November 2022, members of the Audit and Accounts Committee and the Environment and Society Committee examined the  summary of the  risks reviewed by the Environment and Society Committee during the year, the mapping of environmental and societal risks (and changes to the referential) and procedures to control these risks.\n\nThe members of the two Committees also reviewed the procedures  relating to the  preparation  and  processing of extrafinancial information, including a focus on the taxonomy, as well as  a  detailed  examination of certain specific  environmental and societal risks and substantive issues concerning in particular hydrogen production decarbonization processes.\n\nAs part of their work carried out during this joint session, the members also proposed clarifications to the internal regulations of the Board of Directors regarding the respective duties of the Audit and Accounts Committee, the Environment and Society Committee and the joint session between these two Committees. The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the two Committees, adopted this new version of the internal regulations (which already contained the main principles for the distribution of work between the Audit and Accounts Committee and the Environment and Society Committee), in which it is specified that:\n\n- \u25a0 the Audit and Accounts Committee reviews the Group's risks based on the work of the Environment and Society Committee on environmental and societal risks (which examines these risks in detail);\n- \u25a0 the Audit and Accounts Committee is in charge of monitoring the  procedures relating to the  preparation and  processing  of extra-financial information. This item is examined in a joint session with the Environment and Society Committee;\n- \u25a0 the Environment and Society Committee is responsible for reviewing extra-financial information, including the Extrafinancial Performance Statement.\n\n## 10.2.

The Committee wondered about the needs of the Board in terms of skills, including with  regard  to  the  various  subjects  relating  to  CSR.  It made recommendations  on the  desirable  future changes  in the composition of the Board of Directors in the short  and  mediumterm and continued to manage the search and assessment procedure for potential candidates.\n\nThe work of the Committee relating to the search for candidates for the position of Director is presented paragraph 3.1, pages 138 to 139.\n\n## Concerning the composition of the Committees and the Working Group 'Shareholder Relations'\n\nIn 2022, the Committee reviewed the composition of the Committees and the Working Group 'Shareholder Relations'.  In this context, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, in the context of the completion of the terms of office of Ms Sin Leng Low  and  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon at  the close  of the General Meeting  of  May 4,  2022,  to appoint as of this date (i) Mr Xavier Huillard as Chairman of the Appointments and Governance Committee,  (ii)  Mr  Aiman  Ezzat as  member of the Audit Committee, (iii) Mr  Bertrand  Dumazy  as  a  member  of  the Appointments and Governance Committee and (iv) Ms Fatima Tighlaline as a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board meeting on May 4, 2022 approved this new composition of the Committees.\n\n## Concerning the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the management teams\n\nThe Committee reviewed the specific procedure and scenario envisaged in the event of replacement of the Chairman  of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer in an emergency situation. This  procedure  is  reviewed  each  year and updated  as  needed.  During the  past fiscal  year, this procedure was subject to changes in view of the new context of the separation of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, an amendment to the articles of association was submitted and approved by the 2022 General Meeting concerning the statutory age limit of the Chief Executive Officer if he or she also serves as Chairman of the Board in the event of an emergency.\n\n## Successions\n\nAt the end of the work related to the succession in June 2022, at its meeting in September, the Committee examined the evolution of the Group's management teams and talents, particularly in the context of future managerial succession plans. The Chief Executive Officer was involved in this work. In this context, discussions on the succession plan for the new Executive Officer were initiated.\n\nThese discussions will continue in 2023 and will be extended to the succession plan for the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Other governance missions\n\nIn  preparation for the General Meeting, the Committee reviewed the business continuity plan aimed at providing a replacement in the event that any of its members are unable to participate in the General Meeting.\n\nThe Committee took note of the information provided by the Directors concerning their terms of office as Directors which are external to the Group.\n\nAs part of the review of the independence of Board members and Director candidates, the Committee reviewed the personal situation of each member of the Board of Directors, and candidates for this position, with regard to the independence criteria defined in the internal regulations and in the AFEP/MEDEF Code. In this context, the Committee notably examined the existing business relations between the  Group and the groups concerned with regard to each Director,  or  candidates  for  these functions.\n\nIn  accordance with  the  provisions of  the AFEP/MEDEF Code, a table presenting the situation of each Director with regard to each independence criterion is provided on page 141.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the level of attendance of each Director at the  meetings  of  the Board  of  Directors  and the  Committees, which is shown in the table contained on page 142.\n\nIt reviewed the recommendations of the Report of the Haut Comit\u00e9 de gouvernement d'entreprise and the French financial market authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers) Annual Report on Corporate Governance published in November and December 2022, respectively, and made its recommendations concerning the practices followed by the Company. It examined the draft of this section of the Universal Registration Document, incorporating part of the Report on Corporate Governance and recommended that it be adopted by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Committee examined the potential deviations of the Group's practices as compared to the AFEP/MEDEF Code - see chart on page 159. No discrepancies were noted by the Committee.\n\nIn accordance with the decision taken by the Board of Directors, the Committee selected an external  service provider  in order  to carry out the Board's evaluation in 2022. The Committee was informed of the practical arrangements for implementing this evaluation, including the organization of individual interviews with each Director. For more details on the evaluation of the Board of Directors, see section 7 - page 148.\n\nThe February 2023 Committee reviewed the means implemented to achieve the gender equality objectives within the Executive Committee in 2022. In this respect, the Committee reviewed the information relating to the manner in which the Company tries to obtain a balanced representation of women and men on this Committee, as well as the progress made in 2022 in connection with the gender mix targets for 2025 among engineers and executives (35% women) and the objectives concerning the positions with the highest level of responsibility (25% women among senior  executives). The  Committee  recommended to  the Board that the objectives for 2026 concerning the Executive Committee be maintained, namely 30% women by March 1, 2026. The Appointments and Governance Committee also reviewed the results concerning the gender mix with regard to the 10% of positions which carry the most responsibility -for details, see chapter 5 - pages 351, 352 and 400.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the training initiatives offered to Directors. These actions are detailed on pages 146 and 147 for the Directors representing the employees.\n\n## 10.3.

The Chairman  of  the  Board of Directors (or the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  as  the  case  may be) participates in  the work and attends the Committee's meetings.  The Chief Executive Officer is  involved in the Committee's work, particularly  when  the  latter  is  informed  of the  remuneration  policy  for the  main  non-corporate  officers.  However,  the  Chairman  of  the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (or the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be), do not attend the deliberations of this Committee relating to their personal cases. The Committee meets at least three times a year. The conclusions of Committee meetings are presented by the Committee Chair for discussion and decision-making at the next Board of Directors' meeting.\n\n## TASKS\n\n## Pursuant to the internal regulations, the tasks of the Remuneration Committee are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 'examine  the performance  and all  the components  of  remuneration for the  Corporate  Officers and  make  the corresponding recommendations to the Board of Directors (including, in particular, with regard to the determination of the remuneration policy and its application);\n- \u25a0 propose, where applicable, the remuneration of the Vice Chairman or Vice Chairmen;\n- \u25a0 examine the remuneration and retirement policy applied to executives and in particular to Executive Committee;\n- \u25a0 examine the proposals by the Executive Management concerning the granting of stock options, performance shares and other incentive systems related to the share price to other Group employees and propose their granting to the Board of Directors;\n- \u25a0 examine and propose to the Board of Directors the allocation of the fixed annual sum awarded to the Directors set by the General Meeting, in compliance with the legislation relating to the remuneration policy for the Corporate Officers.\n\nThe Committee can request the assistance of outside experts if necessary. The Company shall provide the Committee in such a case with the corresponding funding.'\n\n## The Remuneration Committee's work in 2022\n\nThe Remuneration  Committee  met  three times in  2022  with  an effective attendance rate, or attendance rate by telephone, of 100% of its  members. At  Board meetings, the  Committee  Chair reports on the work of the Remuneration Committee. At the General Meeting, the Committee Chair reports on the Board's decisions concerning the remuneration applicable to the Group's Company Officers.\n\n## Remuneration of the Executive Officers/long-term incentive policy\n\nIn 2022, the Committee evaluated the performance of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the level of achievement of the objectives of his variable remuneration for fiscal year 2021 and drafted recommendations to the Board.  It reviewed the draft reports and resolutions to be put to the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, concerning the remuneration of the corporate officers (a report containing information on the remuneration of the Executive Officer and the Directors and provided for in article L. 22-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code) and the Executive Officer's individual remuneration for 2021.\n\nIn preparing the Company Executive Management succession plan, the Committee worked on the new draft remuneration policy for Company Officers established in keeping with the prior policy, while taking into account evolutions related to the changes in governance under a separate governance mode (these elements were published in the 2021 Universal Registration Document).\n\nDuring its work on the 2022 LTI allocation plans, the Committee renewed its recommendation to allocate only performance shares to all beneficiaries (including the Executive Officer), in accordance with the  general  market trend,  and for reasons of  simplification and homogenization of the system.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer  was  involved  in  the  work  related  to the allocation  of performance shares for 2022, concerning the allocation to Group employees (including the Executive Committee), as well as the review of the performance of the Executive Committee.\n\nIn February 2023, the Committee reviewed the satisfaction of the performance conditions in the 2020 LTI plans, for which the threeyear review period expired on December 31, 2022.\n\nFor 2023 , the Committee reviewed the remuneration policy of the corporate officers submitted to the General Meeting of May 3, 2023.\n\nIt recommended the performance conditions of the 2023 LTI plans that  were adopted  by  the Board  of  Directors in  February  2023, including performance criteria similar to those defined for the 2022 LTI plans (linked to ROCE, TSR and the Climate objectives).\n\nIt  reviewed  the  shareholding  rules which  apply  to  the  Company Officers.\n\nThe Committee prepared the  February 2023 assessment by the Board of Directors of the level of achievement of the performance conditions for the short-term variable remuneration and the pension insurance contract of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (for the period from January 1 to May 31, 2022) and Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer (for the period from June 1 to December 31, 2022).\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the calculation of the remuneration ratios presented in the Universal Registration Document. For 2022, following the separation of the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer  effective from  June 1,  2022 and in accordance with the methodology provided for by the AFEP guidelines,  the  information  required  concerns  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The scope is identical to that of  last  year,  namely  the  Company  itself and  the  'entire  France' scope. In addition, in order to comply with the spirit of the AFEP guidelines, to allow a relevant comparison with employees, and to ensure continuity in the information communicated in successive Universal Registration Documents, the  principle adopted  for  the presentation of the information of the Company Officers referred to above is that of the annualization of remuneration (see pages 205 to 207).",

After the General Meeting approved this policy, the Committee reviewed the  formula for allocation of Directors' remuneration  -  see page 208. It recommended  amounts to be allocated  to  Directors within  the  overall  pay  package  authorized by the General Meeting.\n\nThe Committee  also recommended  the remuneration policy for Directors to be presented to the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, established in keeping with the policy set for the 2022 fiscal year. It recommended an evolution in the amount allocated to the Directors for intercontinental travels in order to improve very slightly its competitivity -see section \"Remuneration policy applicable to directors\" - pages 235 to 236.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nAs  part  of its  work, the  Remuneration Committee  analyses the Shareholders interviews  conducted as  part of General Meeting preparations and the results of General Meeting votes on resolutions relating to remuneration.

It reviewed the section below on remuneration, enclosed in the Report on\n\n## Composition and tasks as defined by the internal regulations\n\nThe Committee must comprise three to four members of the Board of Directors.\n\n## TASKS\n\n'The tasks of this Committee are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 examine, and make recommendation regarding the Group's strategy and commitments in the field of sustainable development;\n- \u25a0 monitor the Group's environmental actions (including in particular topics related to air quality, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions) and societal actions and their deployment, as well as the actions engaged by the Foundation;\n- \u25a0 examine the environmental and societal risks in liaison with the Audit Committee and the impact of environmental and societal issues in terms of investment, performance and image;\n- \u25a0 make an annual review of a summary of the extra-financial ratings made with regard to the Group;\n- \u25a0 make a reasonable judgment regarding the extra-financial information, including the Extra-financial Performance Declaration.'\n\nIn principle, the Committee meets three times a year.\n\nIt reports on its work to the Board of Directors. The conclusions of the meetings of the Environment and Society Committee are presented by the Committee Chair for discussion and, if applicable, for a  decision by the Board of Directors at a later Board meeting. The Committee may be assisted by external experts.\n\nRegular reports are made to the Committee by the member of the Executive Committee in charge of sustainable  development on the Group's sustainable development strategy and its implementation, and the progress made.\n\n## The Environment and Society Committee's work in 2022\n\nThe Environment and Society Committee met three times in 2022, with an effective attendance rate or attendance rate by telephone of 100% of its members.\n\nDuring these meetings, the Committee reviewed the Group's environmental and societal risks, their evolution, and the associated control procedures. With regard  to greenhouse gas\n\nemissions, the Committee's work focused in particular on elements related to the assessment, management and reporting by  the Group  of  greenhouse  gases emissions  according to the various scopes.\n\nThe issue of water management was also examined by the Committee, as was the policy for managing this risk, incorporating the objectives set by the Group. It also reviewed the Group's approach to biodiversity as well as the Group's first set of commitments in this area.\n\nThe Committee also monitored the implementation of ESG objectives (Environment, Societal, Governance). In this context, it examined notably the progress made in the deployment of each performance indicator used to measure the level of progress made within each objective concerned. In this context, the Committee reviewed the deployment of the measures put in place by the Group. The Group's ESG objectives are part of Air Liquide's growth strategy and are structured around three criteria: ACT for a low-carbon society by reducing CO2 emissions, ACT for health, and ACT with confidence by engaging alongside employees and adhering to best governance practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The programs developed between the Foundation and Citizen at Work were also examined, as well as the impacts of these programs on Ukrainian refugees in Poland.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the Group's actions to facilitate access to medical oxygen in low- and moderate-income countries.\n\nThe Committee was informed of the publication of the  Group's first Sustainability Report in April 2022, the content of which was presented to it. This document, published separately, presents Air Liquide's commitments in terms of sustainable development and details the measures taken for a positive and lasting impact on the climate, health  and people.  This report  also  aggregates  all the extra-financial information.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the information in the Extra-financial Performance Declaration  included in this Universal  Registration Document as well as the Vigilance Plan. Furthermore, the Committee read the Report summarizing the Group's extrafinancial ratings. It also drew up a draft work program for 2023.\n\nMeeting documentation is prepared and made available to members in electronic format via a  dedicated platform several days before each meeting of the Environment and Society Committee. At the meeting, each presentation made gives rise to discussion. An oral and then written report of each  meeting is prepared for the Board of Directors.\n\nSince 2019, in the interests of smooth coordination with the work of the Audit and Accounts Committee, the latter and the Environment and Society Committee meet in joint session once a year.

The initial LTI grants to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier decided in 2020 and 2021 will therefore be reduced by -19.5% for the 2020 grant and -52.9% for the 2021  grant and will remain subject to the performance conditions (see page 186). In accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 and in application of the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, given the termination of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier did not benefit from any LTI allocation for 2022 .\n\n## 2. Remuneration of the Company Officers (including information stated in article L. 22-10-9 I of the French Commercial Code)\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until May 31, 2022, to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Chairman of the Board of Directors from June 1, 2022 in respect of their terms of office as decided by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022 and presented in the Company's 2021 Universal Registration Document (pages 199 to 212) was approved by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2022 (in resolutions 14 to 17). This General Meeting also approved the information relating to the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Directors which was presented in the Report on Corporate Governance in the 2021 Universal Registration Document (1) (13 th resolution).\n\nIn 2022, the structure and principles applicable to the remuneration of Company Officers are in line with previous years, while taking into account adjustments related to the separation of functions in the succession in respect of Executive Management.\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy approved in 2022, the main elements of the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 In accordance with a recurring practice at Air Liquide, the fixed remuneration represents approximately 25% ,  the target variable remuneration approximately 35% and the long-term incentive (hereafter ' LTI ') granted approximately 40% of the total annual remuneration. Accordingly, the weight of the variable remuneration and the LTI, which are subject to performance conditions, represents  approximately 75%  of this total  remuneration. Due  to the  cessation of his  term of office as Chief Executive  Officer, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier will not be awarded any LTI for 2022. The fixed portion of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration for  the  period from January 1  to  May  31, 2022 therefore  represents  40%  and the  variable portion  60%  of  his  total  annual  target remuneration.\n\nThe collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription and the termination indemnity are also subject to performance conditions.\n\nThe performance conditions, which are described below, reflect the Group's ambition to achieve profitable growth over the long term by combining financial and extra-financial performance.",

For the quantifiable criteria, the target variable remuneration corresponds to an achievement of 100% of the target objective set at the start of the year. The target objectives fixed are demanding and are completely consistent with the trajectory of the ADVANCE company program;\n- -a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria;\n- -a weighting is allocated to each of the qualitative criteria .\n\n## \u25a0 LTI:\n\n- -All  the LTI granted  to the Executive Officers  are subject  to  performance  conditions calculated  over  a  period  of  three years. Since 2020, the LTI plans have included a performance condition linked to the Group's climate objectives in addition to the ROCE and TSR criteria.\n- -Limits on the grants to Executive Officers: in accordance with the authorizations given by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, the number of performance shares granted to the Executive Officers may not exceed 0.1% of the share capital and the number of stock options, if any, may not exceed 0.2% of the share capital. The Board of Directors also sets annual limits for the grants, which remain well below these sub-limits, it being noted that, as stated above, the LTI must represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration for the Executive Officer.\n- -The other principles which apply to the LTI are unchanged ( proration of the LTI in the event of the Executive Officer's departure during the period of assessment of the performance conditions, no allocation at the time of departure, the level of requirement of the objectives, the rules which apply to the Company Officers as described on pages 196 to 198)\n\nFinally, as in 2021, the Board of Directors decided on September 29, 2022 only to grant performance shares (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all the beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI plan.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer does not receive any remuneration in his capacity as Director.\n\nThe main components of the separate remuneration policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors, approved in 2022, are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 The Chairman of the Board receives only fixed remuneration, to the exclusion of any variable and long-term remuneration (notably LTI) and any exceptional remuneration.\n- \u25a0 The Chairman of the Board does not receive any remuneration as a Director.\n\nThe elements of  remuneration for  Company Officers,  as determined by the  Board of Directors pursuant to the  remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, are described below.\n\n## 2.1.

For the record, in respect of 2021, the fixed remuneration represented 37.6% and the variable remuneration (paid in 2022) represented 62.4%.\n\n## A. Fixed remuneration for 2022\n\nIn accordance with the policy established by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, and approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, the fixed remuneration was determined taking account of the level of responsibilities, the experience in executive management duties and market practices.\n\nAs announced, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's annual fixed remuneration for 2022 amounts to: 1,325,000 euros, unchanged since 2018 . The latter, calculated pro rata over the period from January 1 to May 31, 2022, amounts to 552,083 euros .\n\n## B. Variable remuneration for 2022\n\nThe  principles  and criteria for  the Chairman  and Chief Executive  Officer's  variable  remuneration, as decided upon by the Board  of Directors on February 15, 2022 were approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022 (14 th resolution).\n\nThe variable portion of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's remuneration due in respect of 2022 was calculated pro rata for the period from January 1 to May 31, 2022. On the proposal of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023 assessed the performance of the Company Officer in 2022 over the period.\n\nThe  criteria  for the  variable  remuneration,  their  weighting and  their rate of achievement  are  detailed in  the following summary table (p. 184).\n\n## Quantifiable financial criteria\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, the variable portion for 2022 is based on two financial criteria: increase in recurring earnings per share excluding exchange rates (hereinafter ' recurring EPS ') and comparable growth in consolidated revenue .\n\nThe increase in the recurring EPS criterion makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of an increase  in  sales reflects  the  momentum  of the  activity.  These  two  criteria,  growth  in revenue  and the  recurring  EPS,  reflect  the Group's ambition to achieve profitable growth. Moreover, the achievement of the efficiency objectives contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nFor each  criterion, the  Board of Directors had  defined  a  target objective.  The  target  objectives  were exacting  and  were completely consistent with the trajectory of the main objectives of the company program.\n\nA formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the  basis of the  Consolidated financial statements  for  the  fiscal  year, the  value  achieved for  the  criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable part is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero. The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n\nFurthermore, according to this formula, the rate of achievement of each objective is calculated linearly as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an initial linear gradient between the lower limit of the objective, corresponding to the trigger threshold (0% below this threshold) and the target (corresponding to a 100% achievement of the objective);\n- \u25a0 a second linear gradient between the target (100%) and the maximum achievement level (116% of the target).\n\nThe objectives are not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nevertheless, the rate of achievement of each objective for the variable remuneration (as  a  percentage of the  fixed  remuneration and  as  a  percentage of the  target variable remuneration  allocated  to  that criterion) is communicated in the summary table - page 184.\n\nFollowing an excellent 2022 year, the targets for the quantifiable criteria objectives were achieved at the maximum threshold.\n\n## Qualitative personal criteria\n\nPursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, the variable remuneration for 2022 is also based on the following (qualitative) personal criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 Corporate Social Responsibility (hereinafter 'CSR'):\n- -Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety (lost-time accident frequency rate, road traffic accidents and job-related accidents).\n- -Roll-out  of Action  plans  linked  to  the Group's  new  sustainability  objectives; Progress  made  on  the various  key  indicators  and alignment with the 2025 trajectory linked to these objectives.\n- \u25a0 Organization/Human Resources (management succession plans, hand-over in the context of the succession).\n- \u25a0 Individual performance: this criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer, if the  Company  is facing  an unfavorable environment which  was not  anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nA weight, identical for both target and maximum amounts, is set for each qualitative criterion.\n\nFor 2022, after a detailed analysis by the Remuneration Committee of the achievements for the fiscal year, the Board of Directors noted the following elements concerning each of the personal criteria:",

        "page_content": "## CSR:\n\nPerformance was considered excellent:\n\n## \u25a0 Safety and reliability\n\nBased on the estimated hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate for Group employees stood at 0.94 in 2022, compared to 1.06 in 2021. This indicator has improved compared to 2021, with a significant reduction (-11%) in the number of workplace accidents involving  Group  employees. A  similar  trend  can  be  observed  for  subcontractors.  Overall,  26  fewer people (whether employees or subcontractors) were injured in connection with Group activities in 2022, by comparison with 2021.\n\n2022 was marked by the death of a subcontracted driver involving a road traffic accident. For the record, 2021 had been marked by the deaths of four subcontractors.\n\nIn 2022, under Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's supervision, the main safety programs launched in previous years were continued, notably the IMS Streamlining program, the major cornerstone of industrial safety management for the Group. In this post-Covid period, the main focus was  on  continuity. Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier,  together  with  all the  Executive Committee members,  paid  considerable  attention to Process Safety issues, notably by monitoring the implementation of an ambitious plan to upgrade more than 600 air separation units.\n\nIt made it possible to improve safety at the Group's production sites. Its implementation continued in 2022. Almost all of the 600 units will have been upgraded over the course of these three years. The remaining units concerned will be upgraded at the start of 2023. It can be noted that Air Liquide played a leading role in influencing its peers and inviting them to work together to develop harmonized international standards for everyone's benefit.\n\n## \u25a0 Roll-out of Action plans linked to the Group's new sustainability objectives; Progress made on the various key indicators and alignment with the 2025 trajectory linked to these objectives\n\nThe ADVANCE Plan communicated in March 2022 confirmed the positioning of sustainable development issues at the heart of the Group's development strategy, following on from the ACT program announced by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier at the Sustainability Day on March 23, 2021.\n\nBased  on its  climate  commitment  and the  first  stages  of  its implementation,  the CDP awarded Air  Liquide,  in January  2022,  the highest level ('Leadership Level') for its environmental commitment, which includes some of the most ambitious sustainability objectives in the sector.\n\nIn 2022, work continued and considerable progress has been made, with regard to each of the ACT program commitments.\n\n## -ACT for the climate:\n\nGovernance, reporting and processes for monitoring and managing CO2 emissions were established throughout the Group at the start of  2022.  Annual CO2  budgets, which  may be  positive  or negative  depending  on local factors, are now allocated to the operating entities every year and instruments have been in place for quarterly monitoring of compliance with these budgets and the impact of the activities on the 2025 Carbon trajectory since the start of the year.\n\nDuring the first half, several projects were launched that contribute to the decarbonization of the Group's assets or those of its customers, and renewable energy supply agreements started to be signed around the world, following on from the previous fiscal year (construction by  Air Liquide of its largest biomethane production unit in the  world in the  United States; memoranda of understanding  signed in  South  Korea to explore the  use  of  hydrogen  in  the  decarbonization  of  the  aviation  industry,  and  the development of  the  hydrogen  supply  chain  for  mobility  markets;  development  of  hydrogen  mobility  in Europe;  development  of shipping solutions for carbon management; execution of a ten-year renewable energy purchase agreement in Italy in May 2022 with Shell Energy Europe Limited). In March 2022, Air Liquide received support from the French State for its 200 MW electrolyzer project  in  Normandy for which it has  requested a substantial European subsidy and,  in  April  2022, the  project to transform EQIOM's Lumbres plant, in the Hauts-de-France region, into one of the first carbon-neutral cement plants in Europe, was selected by the European Commission for funding through its Innovation Fund.\n\nIn May 2022, Air Liquide's trajectory to reduce CO2 by 2035 was validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being in line with a 'below 2\u00b0' Scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nFinally, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier pursued his actions and maintained his involvement on the Hydrogen Council, which he co-chaired for 5 years up until the end of 2021, and for which he is now the official representative in Europe, and on the National Hydrogen Council of which he is co-Chair. He continued to play an active role in the work of the ERT (European Round Table), notably on topics related to the energy transition and Hydrogen.\n\n## -ACT for Health:\n\nPursuant to the ADVANCE Plan, the Group's objective in Mature Countries is to improve the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases. In this sector, the teams have continued to develop personalized care pathways that are tailored to comply with local regulations. The proportion of patients receiving care who benefited from these pathways increased significantly over the fiscal year.\n\nIn low and middle-income countries, the objective is to provide an increasing number of people with access to medical oxygen. Once again, thanks to new projects, notably in South Africa, the number of people benefiting from the 'Access Oxygen' program increased in line with the previous fiscal year.\n\n## -ACT for the whole of Society:\n\nThe programs to increase gender diversity within the population of Managers and Professionals continued, even if the result  of 31.5%, at the end of 2022, is slightly lower than that expected for 2022, and the objective is not called into question.\n\nThe objective has been set to extend a common basic social security cover to all employees and the roll-out of the Citizen at Work program, allowing employees to participate in social or societal projects during their working hours, has also been determined and is well on track.\n\nThe progress described above confirms that the Group has been well-positioned, since the start of 2022, with regard to the various pillars of the ACT Plan, in line with the stated goals for 2025.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE",

At the same time, substantial work was carried out in the first part of the year to prepare for the changeover of management. The Human Resources objectives of the ADVANCE plan were finalized in close collaboration with Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and the talent management policy, in line with earlier reviews, was also transferred, in particular to anticipate changes in management teams. Close attention was paid to the changes to the Executive Committee, in preparation for the handover to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and the transfer of his previous responsibilities, with notably the appointment of Mr Ronnie Chalmers, Vice President of the Africa, MiddleEast and India hub, as a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nNumerous specific 'Handover' sessions were organized on a regular basis to ensure a smooth transition and in particular the handover of subjects that were not previously under the responsibility of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his role as Executive Vice President.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier's individual performance is considered excellent despite a mixed global context (start of the war in Ukraine, inflation, energy crisis\u2026).  His  efforts  to  achieve  the Group's  objectives  while at the  same  time preparing  for  his  succession,  the  handover  of responsibilities  and  the implementation  of  the  new  governance  were highly  successful.  Performance in  this regard was assessed at 100%.\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE OF THE VARIABLE REMUNERATION FOR 2022\n\n|

On an annualized basis, it is up very slightly by  0.9% compared to the variable remuneration for 2021. This variation between 2021 and 2022 is the result of exceeding the financial targets for the year 2022 slightly more than the same excess in 2021.",

Total fixed and variable remuneration for 2022 - Changes\n\nIn light of the above, the  fixed and  variable remuneration  of the  Chairman and  Chief  Executive Officer for  the fiscal year 2022 in annualized value is almost stable (+0.6%) compared to 2021 (4) .\n\n## D.  Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nThe benefits in  kind  paid to the  Company Officer  in 2022 include  the use  of  a  company car, as well as the  contributions  paid for unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers during the term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer exercised by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the 2022 fiscal year, namely from January 1 to May 31.\n\n## 2.1.2.  LTI: OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the AFEP/MEDEF Code, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier did not benefit from the 2022 LTI award in respect of his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nHowever, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier remains subject to the shareholding and share ownership obligations for shares and options resulting from plans prior to 2022 in his capacity as Company Officer and remains bound by the other rules applicable to Company Officers relating in particular to hedging transactions.\n\n## Shareholding obligation pursuant to the French Commercial Code\n\nThe shareholding obligations defined by the Board of Directors in accordance with articles L. 225-185 and L. 225-197-1 of the French Commercial Code continue to apply to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, for subscription options and performance shares granted to him in respect of his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from September 28, 2015 until the 2021 performance share plan.\n\nFurthermore, the previous obligations to hold shares resulting from the exercise of stock options, decided by the Board of Directors on May 9, 2007, which apply with effect from the grant of stock options on May 9, 2007 for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, remain in force with regard to the relevant stock option plans, up until the September 22, 2014 stock option plan inclusive.\n\nThe application of this rule was reported to the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023.\n\n## Additional share ownership obligation - Recommendation made by the AFEP/MEDEF Code\n\nMr  Beno\u00eet Potier also continues to be  subject to the shareholding rule defined by the Board  of  Directors  for  Company  Officers, in accordance with an internal rule defined by the Board since 2008, according to which the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer must hold in registered form a number of shares equivalent to twice his gross annual fixed remuneration. This obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. The Board noted that the valuation of the shares held by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as at January 1 and July 1, 2022 was much greater than the amount required and concluded that the shareholding obligation was complied with by the Company Officer.\n\nRecommendations encouraging the ownership of a minimum number of Company shares equivalent to 0.5 times their gross fixed annual remuneration have also been made to members of the Executive Committee since 2009.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Company Officers\n\n- \u25a0 Restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication of the financial statements. These abstention periods open 30 days before the announcement of the annual and half-year consolidated  results  and  15  calendar  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  quarterly  financial  information.  They  end  on  the date  of publication of the information at close of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning the performance shares awarded/options arising from the exercise of options, throughout the length of their term of office. Mr Beno\u00eet Potier remains bound by this commitment for the subscription options and performance shares granted to him under his term of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until the 2021 performance share plan.\n\n## TABLE 6.

The LTI granted to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2020 and 2021 were therefore calculated pro rata, to the effect that the 2020 LTI grant to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier was reduced by -19.5% and the 2021 grant by -52.9%, while the definitive award remains subject to performance conditions and all other conditions (including shareholding obligations) continue to apply.\n\n## 2.1.3.  LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS\n\nThe items presented below, from which Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefited until he claimed his pension (see below), were taken into account in the determination of his total remuneration.\n\n## A. Company pension and similar benefit obligations\n\nIn addition to the mandatory basic and supplementary pension schemes (Agirc-Arrco) with which he is, or was affiliated, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier has been authorized to benefit from various supplementary social benefit schemes set up by L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## 1. Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (as of January 1, 2020)\n\nPursuant to the PACTE Law and Ordinance No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019, the supplementary pension plans which make the vesting of rights  conditional upon the  beneficiaries'  presence at the  Company  at  the time  of  retirement can no  longer  grant a right  to  acquire supplementary conditional rights as from January 1, 2020. For the period up until this date, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's conditional rights under the defined benefit pension plan ('plan S') remain frozen and subject in their entirety to the pension plan regulations (see details below).\n\nSince January 1, 2020, a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription replaced the acquisition of rights under  the  defined benefit pension plan  above.  Pursuant to the  PACTE  Law  and  Ordinance No.  2019-1234  of  November  27,  2019, implementation of this new scheme for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier was approved by the General Meeting of May 5, 2020, pursuant to the remuneration policy (11 th resolution).\n\nIn this scheme, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount is paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nThis scheme was selected from among several alternatives and represented the lowest cost for the Company, being over 20% less than that  of  the previous defined benefit plan (see description of this plan below). For Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, it simply supplemented the rights accumulated under the aforementioned defined benefit pension plan and made it possible to maintain rights which were equivalent to those which would have existed under such plan, if it had been possible for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier to continue to acquire rights under this plan after December 31, 2019. Although, pursuant to the new legislation, this pension insurance contract is not subject to a condition of the beneficiary's presence at the Company at the end of his career, in any event, with regard to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the application of this condition under the defined benefit pension plan had become totally theoretical: a beneficiary who is over 55 years of age and has at least five years' length of service (which is the case for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier) shall retain his rights even if his term of office is terminated, provided that he does not resume any professional activity before his retirement. Consequently, the fact that this condition does not apply to the new mechanism is neutral in this specific situation.\n\nThe  gross  annual contribution amounts  to  approximately  10%  of  the  target fixed and  variable  remuneration  for  2022 (for  the  period January 1 to May 31, 2022), subject to the achievement of identical performance conditions to those which apply to the defined benefit pension plan, which had been determined by the Board of Directors and approved by the General Meeting of May 16, 2018 in its 10 th resolution. Consequently, the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year depends on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified Consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal",

Accordingly, the amount to be paid  in 2023  in  respect of fiscal year 2022 under the  pension scheme with  individual and optional subscription, for the period  January 1,  2022  to May  31, 2022,  will amount overall to  141,667 euros  (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, between a payment of 70,834 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of  an insurance premium,  and  a payment of 70,834 euros (gross)  to Mr Beno\u00eet  Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer). For the record, the amount of contributions paid in 2022 (in respect of 2021) under this scheme in favor of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is 340,000 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, between a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nConsequently, in  respect  of  this fiscal  year  (for  the period from  January 1,  2022  to  May  31,  2022), as  part  of  the  collective  pension insurance contract with individual and optional enrollment:\n\n- \u25a0 the total amount paid corresponds to 10.3% of annual target fixed and variable remuneration in respect of 2022 (for the period from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022);\n- \u25a0 in  the  event  of a  conversion  of  the capital  paid to  the insurer  into  a  life  annuity,  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's  rights  under this  scheme are estimated, at December 31, 2022, and including the payment to be made in 2023 in respect of the 2022 fiscal year (for the period from January 1 to May 31, 2022), at 17,247 euros gross per year.\n\nThis collective  pension insurance  contract  with  individual  and optional  subscription  thus replaced  the  acquisition  of  conditional  rights under the defined benefit pension plan ('plan S'), which was frozen and since January 1, 2020 has allowed no acquisition of supplementary conditional rights. The conditional rights to which Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is entitled pursuant to this plan for the period running up until December 31, 2019 remain subject to the provisions of the plan's regulations, including in particular the condition that he ends his professional career at the Company.\n\nFor the record, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 137-11 of the same Code, the collective defined benefit pension plan 'S' had been set up by Air Liquide for the benefit of the employee senior executives and corporate officers:\n\n- (i) whose remuneration exceeded 24 times the annual social security ceiling (PASS);\n- (ii) who had a total of three years' length of service with the Air Liquide Group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance; and\n- (iii) who were not classed as a participant under the supplementary defined benefit pension plan with guaranteed cover ('garantie de ressources') which was closed in 1996.\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier's conditional rights under this scheme:\n\n- (i) could be applied for, if the beneficiary definitively ended his professional career at the Company and decided to claim his mandatory basic and supplementary pension (Agirc-Arrco) entitlements, whether or not at the full rate. This liquidation took place on June 1, 2022 (see below);\n- (ii) are equal to 1% for each year of service (as at December 31, 2019) of the average of the three best years in the last five years of remuneration exceeding 24 times the annual social security ceiling ('PASS') (the 'Reference Remuneration'). The basis for calculation of  the pension annuity  is limited to  the fixed and  variable  remuneration only,  to the  exclusion  of  any other  form  of remuneration, whether paid by the Company or by any French or foreign subsidiary. For this calculation, the average of the total variable  portions taken  into  account  cannot  exceed  100% of the  average of  the  total fixed portions  taken into account. Where applicable, an annuity equal to 60% of the aforementioned benefits will be paid to the surviving spouse, subject to certain conditions, notably with regard to age;\n- (iii) are capped, in all cases, as they are for all the senior executives benefiting from the defined benefit plan, and for all pension plans combined, whether public or private, in France or abroad, at 45% of the Reference Remuneration. Should this ceiling be reached, the amount paid under the defined benefit plan would be reduced accordingly;\n- (iv) have been the subject of:\n- -contributions paid to an insurance body, that are deductible from the corporate income tax base, and -provisions in the Group's Consolidated financial statements;\n\n<!-- image -->",

These performance conditions were similar to those applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier under the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscriptions set up on January 1, 2020 to replace the frozen defined benefit pension plan, until May 31, 2022.\n\n## 2. Mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO) and senior executive contribution pension plan\n\n- \u25a0 For the record, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, the Air Liquide Group has set up, at several companies including L'Air Liquide S.A., a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of all the employees (article 83 of the French Tax Code).\n\nThe individual application of this plan to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier had been authorized by a decision of the Board of Directors on February 12, 2010, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 5, 2010 (9 th resolution).\n\nIn order to bring it into line with the new legal and regulatory plan arising from the PACTE Law, this defined contribution pension plan was transferred collectively to a mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO) on January 1, 2021.\n\nThe application of this plan to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as from January 1, 2021 was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 9, 2021 and this item was incorporated into the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021.\n\nIn keeping with the prior plan, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the 'PERO' defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Executive Officers, contributions to which are paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on the fraction of remuneration which does not exceed eight times the annual social security ceiling (PASS).\n\nThese contributions are assessed on bracket 1 (formerly bracket A) (the portion of remuneration that is less than one PASS) at a rate of  2.30%, and on bracket 2 (formerly brackets B and C) (those portions of remuneration amounting, respectively, to between one PASS and eight times the PASS) at a rate of 6.45%, and are distributed in the following manner: 50% borne by the Company and 50% borne by the beneficiary.\n\nFurthermore,  they  are  deductible  from  the  corporate income tax  base,  are  subject  to  the  social  levy  at  the  rate  of  16%,  and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nFor information purposes, contributions paid in respect of 2022, until May 31, 2022, by the Company for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier totaled 4,066 euros. This amount is also indicated in the notes to Table 2.\n\nThe pension rights of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier under this plan are estimated, as at December 31, 2022, at 9,830 gross euros per year.\n\n- \u25a0 In addition, pursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, L'Air Liquide S.A. set up a defined contribution  pension  plan  for  the  benefit  of  the  senior executives, defined by reference to a collective bargaining agreement coefficient, and of corporate officers  who  have at least one year's length of service.\n\nSince 2015,  Mr Beno\u00eet  Potier  no  longer benefits from this defined contribution pension plan  set  up for  the benefit of  the senior executives, the contribution paid for his benefit having been transferred to the life insurance plan (see below).\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier's pension entitlements under this defined contribution plan implemented for the benefit of senior executives:\n\n- -were financed by annual contributions  paid  in  their  entirety by  the  Company. These contributions were last set  at  2.5%  of  the portion of remuneration that is lower than eight times the PASS. Furthermore, they were subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid pursuant to the defined contribution pension plan set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above);\n- -are estimated, as at December 31, 2022, at 194,829 euros gross per year.\n\n## Claiming of pension rights\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier claimed his pension rights under the various pension plans described above on June 1, 2022, date on which he claimed his pension rights under the general social security pension, with the exception of the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (which may only be claimed after the last payment of contributions, which will be made in 2023 for the 2022 fiscal year for the period from January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022) (6) .\n\n## B. Other life benefits\n\n## 1. Life insurance plan\n\nSince Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is no longer a beneficiary of the defined contribution pension plan for senior executives (see above), L'Air Liquide S.A. has entered into a collective life insurance contract which enables him to create savings which are available at any time.\n\nThe insurance contract provides that the beneficiary can ask for the payment of a single capital sum or conversion of the capital into a life annuity.",

The contributions paid by the Company to the third-party plan manager were assessed on the basis of the portions of  the Reference Remuneration of the  beneficiaries corresponding to each of  the three brackets, in accordance with conditions identical to those of the previous plan.\n\nThe contributions were  reviewed  each year on  the basis of  the amount of  the PASS. These  contributions  are  deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nFor Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, the signature of this contract, for the third and then the second bracket, was authorized by decisions of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2012 and February 13, 2013 in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 7, 2013 in a specific resolution (7 th resolution). The extension of the plan to the first bracket concerning the band of Reference Remuneration amounting to between 0 and 8 times the annual social security ceiling was authorized by decision of the Board of Directors on November 20, 2014, in accordance with the regulated agreements and commitments procedure, and approved by the General Meeting on May 6, 2015, in a specific resolution for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier (7 th resolution).\n\nThe amount paid by the Company in 2022 in respect of the 2021 fiscal year to the insurance body pursuant to the life insurance plan for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2. The amount to be paid in 2023 for the period from January 1 to May 31, 2022 (7) , is also indicated in these notes.\n\n## 2. Death and disability benefits plan\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the additional 'incapacity, disability, death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the corporate officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such plan, which provides in particular for:\n\n- \u25a0 the grant to the beneficiaries:\n- -of additional daily indemnities in the event of incapacity and a disability annuity set, all benefits combined, at a maximum annual amount of 460,723 euros, and\n- -of a death benefit, the maximum amount of which is set at 120 times the PASS in the event of an accident.\n\nThe life insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the incapacity/disability and death benefits for the same insured party;\n\n- \u25a0 the payment in full, by the Company, of the contributions calculated as a percentage of the Reference Remuneration which is capped at:\n- -16 times the PASS for the incapacity and disability cover, and\n- -24 times the PASS for the death cover.\n\nThe contribution rate for 2022 amounts to 1.10% of the Reference Remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 0.89% between 16 and 24 PASS. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of an amount equal to the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration, taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe individual application to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier of this unified benefit plan covering all the personnel, in respect of his duties as Chairman and  Chief  Executive Officer, was authorized by decision of  the Board  of Directors on November 20,  2014, in  accordance with  the regulated agreements  and  commitments  procedure, and approved by the  General Meeting on  May 6, 2015 in a specific  resolution (7 th resolution).\n\nThe contribution paid in 2022 by L'Air Liquide S.A. in respect of the death and disability benefits plan for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, for the period from January 1 to May 31, 2022, was 4,237 euros and is also indicated in the notes to Table 2 (see page 181).\n\n## C.  Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\n## 1. Indemnities relating to termination of duties\n\nBeno\u00eet Potier was entitled to an indemnity relating to termination of duties, in the cases listed below, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe main terms of the termination indemnity applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier were:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier from his terms of office as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of gross fixed and variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, in his capacity as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, approaches  the age  limit defined  in the  Company's articles  of  association;  in the  event  of  a  forced departure in  the 24  months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC would be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps would be calculated on the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial gas industry, of the management and control of investment processes, this gap would make it possible to measure the regular creation of value over the three years prior to the departure.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due would be established as indicated in the table below, with an increase in the indemnity by straightline segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n(a)\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                              | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                              | 0%                            |\n\nThe decision of the Board of Directors on February 14, 2018 (8) relating to this indemnity was made in accordance with the regulated agreements  and commitments procedure and published on the Company's  website  on February 16,  2018.  It  was approved  by  the General Meeting on May 16, 2018 in a specific resolution (9 th resolution).\n\nThis  mechanism was maintained for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier until  the  date  on  which  he  ended  his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer (CEO), i.e. May 31, 2022. It was never implemented and is now obsolete.\n\n## 2. Unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers\n\nBy decision of the Board of Directors in May 2006, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier benefited, in his capacity as a corporate officer, from the unemployment  insurance for company managers  and  corporate  officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company are added back to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's 2022 remuneration as benefits in kind.\n\nThis  decision  had  been  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  on  May  9,  2007,  in  accordance  with  the regulated  agreements procedure (7 th resolution).\n\nThe Board of Directors confirmed, at its meeting on May 16, 2018, that Mr Beno\u00eet Potier continued to benefit from this unemployment insurance within the scope of the latest renewal of his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis  mechanism was maintained for Mr Beno\u00eet Potier until  the  date  on  which  he  ended  his  term  of  office  as  Chief  Executive  Officer (CEO), i.e. May 31, 2022.

Variable remuneration for 2022\n\nThe principles and criteria for the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, as decided upon by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, were approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022 (15 th resolution).\n\nThe Chief Executive  Officer's variable remuneration due  in  respect of 2022  was calculated pro-rata for the period from June  1  to December  31,  2022. On the  proposal of the  Remuneration Committee,  the Board  of  Directors  on  February  15, 2023 assessed  the performance of the Company Officer in 2022 over the period.\n\nThe criteria for the variable remuneration, their weighting and their rate of achievement are detailed in the following summary table.\n\n## Quantifiable financial criteria\n\nIn  accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, the variable  remuneration  for  2022  is based on two financial criteria: increase in recurring net earnings (excluding exceptional and significant transactions which do not impact operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share (hereinafter ' recurring EPS ') and comparable growth in consolidated revenue  (excluding significant scope impact  and  the impact of currency  and  energy). Details  of these  criteria are contained  in the summary table below (page 195).\n\nThe increase in the recurring EPS criterion makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement. The criterion of an increase  in  sales reflects  the  momentum  of the  activity.  These  two  criteria,  growth  in revenue  and the  recurring  EPS,  reflect  the Group's ambition to achieve profitable growth. Moreover, the achievement of the efficiency objectives contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nFor each  criterion, the  Board of Directors had  defined  a  target  objective.  The  target  objectives  were exacting  and  were completely consistent with the trajectory of the main objectives of the company program.\n\nA formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the  basis of the  Consolidated financial statements  for  the  fiscal  year, the  value  achieved for  the  criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set, the value of the variable part is adjusted upward within the maximum limit set for each criterion. In the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero. The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria.\n\nFurthermore, according to this formula, the rate of achievement of each objective is calculated linearly as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an initial linear gradient between the lower limit of the objective, corresponding to the trigger threshold (0% below this threshold) and the target (corresponding to a 100% achievement of the objective);\n- \u25a0 a second linear gradient between the target (100%) and the maximum achievement level (125% of the target).\n\nThe objectives are not made public for confidentiality reasons. Nevertheless, the rate of achievement of each objective for the variable remuneration  (as  a  percentage of  the  fixed  remuneration and  as  a  percentage of the  target variable remuneration  allocated  to  that criterion) is communicated in the summary table on page 195.\n\nFollowing an excellent year in 2022, the quantifiable criteria objectives were achieved at the maximum threshold.\n\n## Qualitative personal criteria\n\nPursuant to the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, the variable remuneration for 2022 is also based on (qualitative) personal criteria. The latter, defined in keeping with the continuity of qualitative objectives of the Executive Officer during prior years, making changes however corresponding to developments in strategy and extra-financial performance criteria, are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 CSR: ESG objectives published by the Group on Sustainability Day on March 23, 2021:\n- -Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety (lost-time accident frequency rate, road traffic accidents and job-related accidents),\n- -Roll-out  of Action  plans  linked  to  the Group's  new  sustainability  objectives; Progress  made  on  the various  key  indicators  and alignment with the 2025 trajectory linked to these new objectives;\n- \u25a0 Organization / Human Resources (talent development, management succession plans, diversity policy);\n- \u25a0 Individual performance: this criterion responds to the Board of Directors' desire to keep a part of the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer, if the  Company  is facing  an unfavorable environment which  was not  anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nA target weighting and a maximum weighting are set for each qualitative criterion.\n\nFor 2022, after a detailed analysis by the Remuneration Committee of the achievements for the fiscal year, the Board of Directors noted the following elements concerning each of the personal criteria:\n\n## CSR:\n\nPerformance was considered very good:\n\n## \u25a0 Safety and reliability\n\nBased on the estimated hours worked, the lost-time accident frequency rate of Group employees stood at 0.94 in 2022, compared to 1.06 in 2021. This indicator has improved compared to 2021, with a significant reduction (-11%) in the number of workplace accidents involving  Group  employees. A  similar  trend  can  be  observed  for  subcontractors.  Overall,  26  fewer people (whether employees or subcontractors) were injured in connection with Group activities in 2022, by comparison with 2021.\n\n2022 was marked by the death of a subcontracted driver involving a road traffic accident. For the record, 2021 had been marked by the deaths of four subcontractors.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nSince taking office, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow has constantly stressed the importance of safety, notably during his numerous site visits in Operations, as shown in the video made during his trip to Poland on June 1, 2022. These opportunities have enabled him to promote the Group's Safety Culture, taking advantage of each of these visits to initiate a dialogue on safety with the employees encountered.\n\nHe has also regularly reiterated, for example in the editorial he wrote for the Group's HSE newsletter published in September, that the goal of 'zero accidents' for employees and partners remains the Group's top priority.\n\nIn terms of action plans, he built on previous programs, stressing the need to remain focused in order to bring them to a successful conclusion, before launching other major projects. Accordingly, he continued to supervise, both personally and together with all the Executive Committee members, the progress of the IMS Streamlining program and the plan to upgrade more than 600 air separation units. In four years, more than 600 units will have been upgraded. It can be noted that Air Liquide played a leading role in influencing its peers and inviting them to work together to develop harmonized international standards for everyone's benefit.\n\nIn addition, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow regularly reiterated the importance of Road Safety in Air Liquide Operations, notably at the Group Management Meeting in October 2022, where he confirmed his support and involvement in the roll-out of the Group's Road Safety action plan.\n\nFinally, in addition to these main programs, actions aimed at improving the understanding of major industrial risks were initiated in the second half of 2022, in order to enhance the safety culture among Air Liquide employees; these actions will be rolled out across the Group over the course of 2023 and 2024.\n\n## \u25a0 Roll-out of  Action  plans  linked  to the  Group's  new sustainability  objectives;  Progress  made  concerning the  various  key indicators and alignment with the 2025 trajectory for these new objectives\n\nThe Advance Plan communicated  in  March 2022, prepared as a result of  close  coordination  between Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow and Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, confirmed that sustainable development issues are placed at the heart of the Group's development strategy.\n\nThe objectives announced have been rolled out throughout the year and considerable progress has been made with respect to each of the ACT program commitments.\n\n## -ACT for the Climate:\n\nGovernance, reporting and processes for monitoring and managing CO2 emissions have been actively rolled out across the whole Group. Annual CO2 budgets, which may be positive or negative depending on local factors, are now allocated to the operating entities every year. Each quarter, compliance with these budgets and the impact of activities on the 2025 Carbon trajectory are analyzed and presented to the Executive Committee. The Group's CO2 emissions are also reported and consolidated each quarter.\n\nDuring the second half, several new projects were signed that contribute to the decarbonization of the Group's assets or those of its customers, together with projects for the production of low-carbon hydrogen, demonstrating the proactive implementation of the Climate objectives announced by the Group (agreement with TotalEnergie in November 2022 to produce and recover renewable, low-carbon hydrogen for the Grandpuits refinery using innovative processes; the first contracts for the production of carbon-free hydrogen in China; obtaining European subsidies for a project to decarbonize the Antwerp port platform and the backing of the Dutch government for two major electrolyzer projects in the Netherlands in December 2022). In addition, the signing of long-term renewable energy supply agreements has accelerated (e.g. the execution by Air Liquide of its largest renewable energy supply agreement in the Netherlands in June 2022).\n\nActive communication was also maintained concerning hydrogen as an accelerator of the energy transition (the Hydrogen Generation broadcast on September 28, 2022).\n\nFinally, all the  extra-financial ratings obtained were  stable in 2022 or improved by comparison with  the previous  fiscal year. Air Liquide was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe index for the first time.\n\n## -ACT for Health:\n\nThe Group's objective in Mature Countries is to improve the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases. In this sector, the Healthcare teams continued to develop personalized care pathways that are tailored to comply with local regulations. The proportion of patients receiving care who benefited from these pathways increased significantly over the fiscal year.\n\nIn low and middle-income countries, the objective is to provide an increasing number of people with access to medical oxygen. Once again, thanks to new projects, notably in South Africa, the number of people benefiting from the 'Access Oxygen' program increased over the course of the fiscal year.\n\n## -ACT for the whole of Society:\n\nThe programs to increase gender diversity within the population of Managers and Professionals continued, even if the result of 31.5%, at the end of 2022, is slightly lower than expected for 2022, and the objective is not called into question.\n\nOn the other hand, the generalization of a common basic social security cover for all employees and the roll-out of the Citizen at Work program, allowing  employees to  participate  in  social or societal  projects during  their  working hours, saw considerable progress throughout the fiscal year and are currently ahead of the 2025 roadmap. Roll-out of care coverage at the end of 2022 has already reached 42%.\n\nThe action and progress described above confirm that, thanks to a structured and proactive implementation of the objectives set, the Group is well-positioned with regard to the various pillars  of  the ACT  commitments,  in  line  with  the  2025  trajectory  for  these  new objectives.\n\n## Organization and Human Resources:\n\nThe Group's talent development policy continued as before, with regular reviews. As in previous years, these reviews were conducted at the level of our operational clusters  right up to the Executive Committee. Special focus was placed on international development opportunities in the context of reduced mobility due to the Covid crisis. The diversity of profiles was also carefully reviewed, in order to promote the many cultures within the Group at key positions, and to continue to improve the gender balance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In June, a dedicated session lasting  several  days was  organized with  the support of external partners, in order to define how the Executive Committee will operate under Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's leadership. Changes have also been made to the Executive Committee, notably with the appointment of M. Ronnie Chalmers, Vice President of the Africa, Middle-East and India hub, as well as adjustments to some members' perimeters.\n\nMoreover, in  connection  with  his  taking office, in  addition to  the 'handover' sessions, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow organized numerous trips within  the  Group  (in  particular to Asia  and  the Americas) in  order to meet the teams directly  in  the  field  in  as  short  a timeframe  as possible, including notably those teams who did not come under his responsibility in his former roles.\n\nAt Mr Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow's request, Executive  Committee sessions were dedicated  to diversity issues during  the review  of the  ESG objectives and, more broadly, to the inclusion policy. Gender equality targets were reviewed, as well as their implementation throughout the Group, and Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow expressed his strong commitment concerning the policy for the inclusion of disabled workers, notably at the various events organized during Disability Week.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's individual performance is considered remarkable. At the pivotal moment of the succession and his taking up office, in  a  macroeconomic  environment marked  by  an unprecedented  increase  in  costs,  notably energy  costs,  and an  unfavorable geopolitical  situation, he demonstrated  strong  commitment  to  the  Group's  success while  also expressing  his  gratitude  to  the teams. Performance in this regard was assessed at 110%.",

These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of an amount equal to the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration, taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe contributions paid by L'Air  Liquide S.A. for  the benefit of Mr  Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  in 2022, for the period from  June  1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, amounted to 5,932 euros in respect of the death and disability plan and 231 euros in respect of the healthcare cost plan (i.e. a total of 6,163 euros) and are also indicated in the notes to Table 2 (page 191).\n\n## 2.2.2.  LTI: STOCK OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES\n\n## A.  2022 performance share plan (plan dated September 29, 2022)\n\n## 1. Principles of grant for 2022\n\nFor  the Chief  Executive  Officer,  the grant for  2022  forms part  of  the 2022 remuneration policy  defined  by  the Board of Directors  on February 15, 2022 and approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022.\n\nThe grant of LTI to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer in 2022 represents, for the  period  from  June  1  to December 31, 2022, an IFRS valuation of 961,965 euros .\n\nMoreover, since 2019, the Board of Directors decided, following the general market trend, to grant only performance shares (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all the beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the LTI scheme.\n\n## 2. Performance conditions of the 2022 plans\n\nAll the performance shares granted to any beneficiary are subject to performance conditions which are calculated over three years. The performance conditions were set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nFor reasons of confidentiality, the exact objectives set for each performance condition will be made public ex post, at the end of the  Board  of  Directors'  meeting  at  the time  when the financial  statements  are  adopted for  the 2024 fiscal year.  The  results achieved, the rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of performance shares vested will also be published at the end of this meeting. The percentage of performance shares definitively awarded may in no event exceed 100% of the initial grant. The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any set-off between criteria .\n\nIn keeping with the Group's responsible growth approach, the 2022 performance share plans incorporate, as they did in 2021, a performance condition linked to the Group's Climate Objectives .\n\nAccordingly, the number of performance shares definitively awarded pursuant to the 2022 Plans will depend:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted , on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) (12) recorded at the end of the 2024 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This  lower  limit  corresponds  to  a ROCE level  which is  200  basis  points  less  than the  objective  set,  which provides a  degree  of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective has been set within the trajectory of the ROCE target announced by the Company that is maintained at more than 10% for 2023-2024, reflecting the impact of the crisis as well as a pro-active investment policy in a context of numerous and qualitative opportunities, notably in relation to the energy transition;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, dividends reinvested, for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years (' AL TSR '). The objective of an absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award,\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air  Liquide  shares,  dividends reinvested  -  source: Bloomberg  (' B  TSR '), as compared  to  the CAC 40  TSR  index, dividends reinvested (source: Bloomberg) for the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years.\n\nThe rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least higher than 2% of the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible.",

Rules applicable to Executive Officers\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy, the grant to the Executive Officer is examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe grant of performance shares was examined in light of the total amount of the Executive Officer's annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the Shareholders are respected.\n\nBefore the grant, it was verified that the conditions provided for in article L. 22-10-60 of the French Commercial Code, which aims at involving  all staff  in France in the  Company's performance,  are  satisfied.  Therefore in 2022, over 98% of all  the employees  in  the Company and in the Group's French entities are covered by an incentive plan or a special or voluntary profit-sharing plan.\n\n## Limits on the grants to Executive Officers\n\nWithin the scope of the sub-limits authorized by the General Meeting for 38 months, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the  Executive Officers, expressed  (i) as a percentage  of the  share  capital and  (ii) as a multiple  of  their  remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe limits set by the Board of Directors for 2022 are identical to those for 2021 and are as follows (no subscription option having been attributed in 2022):\n\n- (i) the  total number  of performance  shares granted in 2022 to  the sole  Executive Officer cannot give rise  to a number  of shares exceeding 0.012% of the share capital (it being understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.1% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022);\n- (ii) the total aggregate IFRS value of the performance shares granted to the Executive Officer cannot exceed approximately 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer's maximum gross annual remuneration (fixed + variable maximum), it being noted that the performance shares granted represent approximately 40% of the total target annual remuneration.\n\n## Maintaining the proration principle\n\nPursuant to the decision made by the Board on February 15, 2022 and the policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022, the 2022 grant of LTI to the Executive Officer remains subject to the principle of a pro rata calculation.\n\nIn practice, if the Executive Officer leaves the Group for a reason other than his resignation or removal from office for serious cause (14) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro-rata for the duration of actual presence of the Executive Officer within the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. Furthermore, no grant is made to the Executive Officer at the time of this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating to the duration of the vesting, lock-up and holding periods in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, the Board of Directors decided to maintain this rule in identical form.\n\nThese lock-up obligations are applicable to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer from the 2022 performance share plan.\n\n## Additional share ownership obligation - Recommendation made by the AFEP/MEDEF Code\n\nThe Board of Directors' meeting of February 15, 2022 defined, as an extension of the internal rule defined by the Board since 2008, the shareholding rule according to which the Company Officers must hold, in a registered share account, a number of shares equivalent to twice his gross annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer or the Chairman of the Board of Directors and one time the gross annual fixed remuneration for a Senior Executive Vice President. This obligation will remain in force until it is exceeded by the effect of the rules resulting from the French Commercial Code. The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year.\n\nThe Board of Directors decided, in  line  with  the previous practice,  that  this  rule  would  apply  to the  newly  appointed Chief  Executive Officer, who would have to comply within four years of his appointment. The assessment of the application of this rule for Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will therefore take place from July 1, 2026.\n\nRecommendations encouraging the ownership of a minimum number of Company shares equivalent to 0.5 times their gross fixed annual remuneration, have also been made to members of the Executive Committee since 2009.\n\n## Other rules applicable to the Company Company Officers\n\n- \u25a0 Restriction on the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior to the publication of the financial statements. These abstention periods open 30 days before the announcement of the annual and half-year consolidated  results  and  15  calendar  days  prior  to  the  publication  of  the  quarterly  financial  information.  They  end  on  the date  of publication of the information at close of business.\n- \u25a0 Commitment not to carry out hedging transactions with regard to the risk concerning the performance shares awarded/options arising from the exercise of options, throughout the length of their term of office.\n\n## B.  Grants to the Chief Executive Officer within the scope of the September 29, 2022 performance share plan Regulations\n\nThe grant to the Chief Executive Officer is governed by the September 29, 2022 'France' performance share plan which applies to all the beneficiaries in France. This plan contains:\n\n- \u25a0 a three-year vesting period;\n- \u25a0 followed by a two-year holding period during which the shares cannot be sold.\n\n## DIAGRAM OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE MECHANISM - 2022 PLAN (FRANCE)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nContinued presence in the Company is a condition under the plan in order to qualify for performance shares at the end of the vesting period, the loss of rights for the Chief Executive Officer occurring in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.",

Recording of the achievement of the performance conditions under the September 29, 2020 performance share plans (17)\n\nOn the basis of the financial statements for the 2022 fiscal year submitted for the approval of the General Meeting of May 3, 2023, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, recorded the rate of achievement of the performance conditions, which apply to the whole of the performance shares awarded to any beneficiary and were determined at the time of the grant of the September 29, 2020 performance share plans.\n\nAs in 2019, the Board decided to grant only performance shares to any beneficiaries, for reasons of simplification and homogenization.\n\nThe 2020 annual plans provided that the number of performance shares definitively awarded would depend on the rate of achievement of the following objectives:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted on the rate of achievement of a target, set by the Board, comprising the after-tax Return on Capital Employed ('ROCE') recorded at the end of the 2022 fiscal year.\n- At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This  lower  limit corresponds  to  a ROCE level  which is  200  basis  points  less  than the  objective  set,  which provides a  degree  of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective  had been set within  the  trajectory  of  the  NEOS  company  program  which  aimed  at  a  ROCE  of  more than  10% in 2021-2022.\n\nThe ROCE level for the aforementioned period was 10.3%, i.e. an objective achieved at 100%;\n\n- (ii) for 40% of the performance shares granted:\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): an objective of Total Shareholder Return ('AL TSR') set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate of an investment in Air Liquide shares, dividends reinvested, for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. At the objective set of +6%, the grant of shares is 100%, and then decreases on a straight-line basis to +2%. This growth, over the aforementioned period, amounted to 9.25% per year, i.e. a target achieved at 100%,\n- -for 50% of the performance shares referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, dividends reinvested - source: Bloomberg ('B TSR'), as compared to the CAC 40 TSR index, dividends reinvested\n- (source: Bloomberg) for the 2020, 2021 and 2022 fiscal years. The applicable formula provided that the rate of achievement of this performance condition was (i) 0% if the average Air Liquide TSR was lower than the average CAC 40 TSR, (ii) 50% if the average Air Liquide TSR was equal to the average CAC 40 TSR, and (iii)  100% if the average Air Liquide TSR was at least 2% higher than the average CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR was impossible. The rate of return for Air Liquide over the aforementioned period is 7.34%. That of the CAC 40 index over the same period is 6.74%. This gives the difference between the average rate of return for Air Liquide and the average rate of return for the CAC 40\n- as 0.60%, i.e. an objective achieved at 65.08%;\n- (iii) for 10% of the performance shares granted, the reduction in Air Liquide's carbon intensity, defined as the following ratio, recorded as at  December 31, 2022: Greenhouse gas emissions of the Air Liquide Group for the year 2022 in kg-equivalent CO \u2082 /2022 EBITDA (calculated at constant exchange rate on the basis of the 2015 foreign exchange rates) expressed in euros. For the purposes hereof, the greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2).\n\nThe objective was determined within the trajectory of the Group's Climate Objectives announced at the end of 2018 which aim to reduce the carbon intensity by -30% between 2015 and 2025.\n\nThe achievement rate was set at 0% for carbon intensity above 4.8, 50% for carbon intensity at 4.7 and 100% for carbon intensity up to 4.6, based on a linear progression from 0% to 100% between those bounds.\n\nThe ratio recorded as at December 31, 2022 is 4.28, i.e. a target achieved at 100%.\n\nConsequently, the Board of Directors recorded that the rate of achievement of the performance conditions for the September 29, 2020 performance share plans amounts to 93.02%.",

Company's pension and similar benefit obligations\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefits, in addition to the mandatory basic and supplementary pension plans (Agirc-Arrco) to which he is, or has been, affiliated, from various supplementary pension plans set up by L'Air Liquide S.A.\n\n## 1. Mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO)\n\nUntil May 31, 2022, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in his capacity as an employee, benefited, in addition to the mandatory pension plans, from the supplementary defined contribution pension plan applicable to all employees and Company Officers.\n\nThe continued application of this plan to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, and approved by the General Meeting as part of the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer (15 th resolution).\n\nThis plan, applicable to all employees and Company Officers, is financed by contributions paid equally by the employer and the beneficiary on the portion of remuneration not exceeding eight times the annual social security ceiling (PASS).\n\nThese contributions are assessed on bracket 1 (formerly bracket A) (the portion of remuneration that is less than one PASS) at a rate of 2.30%, and on bracket 2 (formerly brackets B and C) (those portions of remuneration amounting, respectively, to between one PASS and eight times the PASS) at a rate of 6.45%, and are distributed in the following manner: 50% borne by the Company and 50% borne by the beneficiary.\n\nFurthermore, they are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at the rate of 16%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nFor information purposes, the contributions paid by the Company in 2022, for the period from June 1 to December 31, 2022, to the third party responsible for managing the aforementioned supplementary defined contribution pension plan, in favor of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, amounted to 5,693 euros.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's pension entitlements under this plan:\n\n- \u25a0 may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme;\n- \u25a0 are estimated, as at December 31, 2022, at 14,598 euros gross per year. This amount takes into account the contributions paid by the Company for the benefit of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as an employee and then as Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 2. 'Senior executive' defined contribution pension plan\n\nPursuant to articles L. 911-1 and L. 911-2 of the French Social Security Code, and in accordance with article L. 242-1, paragraphs 6 and 7 of the same Code, L'Air Liquide S.A. set up a defined contribution pension plan for the benefit of the senior executives, defined by reference to a collective bargaining agreement coefficient, and of corporate officers who have at least one year's length of service.\n\nMr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow  benefited from this defined contribution pension  plan as  a  senior  executive until  May 31,  2022.  The  continued application of this plan to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and until the end of his term of office, was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, and approved by the General Meeting as part of the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer (15 th resolution).\n\nFor information purposes, the contributions paid by the Company in 2022, for the period from June 1 to December 31, 2022, in favor of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, amounted to 5,183 euros.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's pension entitlements under this defined contribution plan implemented for the benefit of senior executives:\n\n- \u25a0 may be applied for, at the earliest, when he has claimed his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme;\n- \u25a0 are financed by annual contributions paid in their entirety by the Company. These contributions were set at 2.7% of the portion of remuneration that is lower than eight times the PASS. Furthermore, they are subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid under the PERO set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above);\n- \u25a0 are estimated, as at December 31, 2022 at 26,115 euros gross per year.\n\n## 3. Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nUntil May 31, 2022, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefited, in addition to the PERO and the defined contribution pension plan for the aforementioned  senior  executives, from a supplementary pension  scheme  applicable  under certain conditions  to the  Group's senior executives. As  this  scheme is  not applicable  to  Company  Officers, Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow  could no  longer  benefit  from  it as from his appointment as a Company Officer, i.e. beginning on June 1, 2022.\n\nTo replace this plan, from June 1, 2022 until the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefits from a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (known as 'article 82 of the French General Tax Code') for the reference portion of his remuneration [fixed remuneration + target variable remuneration] exceeding eight times the PASS.\n\nThe implementation of this scheme for the benefit of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow was approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 as part of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration policy (15 th resolution).\n\nApplication of this mechanism to the Chief Executive Officer was determined taking into account the overall balance of his remuneration and the market conditions, and for the Company represents, for the same efficiency for the beneficiary, a 31% lower cost to the Company than that which would result from implementing a new supplementary pension plan with defined vested benefits under article L. 137-11-2 of the French Social Security Code.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n<!-- image -->",

This amount is paid in arrears every year after recording the performance conditions associated with this pension plan, for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow cannot apply for the entitlements under this  pension  insurance contract in  the  form  of  capital  and/or life  annuity before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThis supplementary pension plan for the fraction of remuneration exceeding 8 PASS is entirely subject to performance conditions. The gross annual amount of payments is approximately 14.3% of the target annual fixed and variable remuneration for 2022, subject to the achievement of performance conditions: the total amount to be paid in respect of a fiscal year depends on the average annual difference between the after-tax Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (measured on the basis of the book value of  equity),  calculated  (on  the basis of the  Consolidated financial statements certified and  approved by the  General Meeting) over the last three fiscal years preceding the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract will be determined as shown in the  table  below,  with  a  growth of the  increase per  linear  segments  between  each  of  the  thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps  (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100 %                                                    |\n| 250                                                                     | 66 %                                                     |\n| 200                                                                     | 50 %                                                     |\n| 100                                                                     | 25 %                                                     |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0 %                                                      |\n\nCompliance with the conditions set forth above is verified on an annual basis, before the Ordinary General Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the last completed fiscal year, by the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  respect of 2022, the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, took note of the 100% achievement of the performance conditions. Accordingly, the amount to be paid in 2023 in respect of 2022 under the pension scheme with individual and optional subscription, for the period June  1,  2022 to December 31, 2022, will  amount  overall  to 202,274 euros  (split, in  accordance  with  the  remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, between a payment of 101,137 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 101,137 euros (gross) to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nConsequently,  in  respect of this fiscal  year (for  the period  June 1,  2022  to December  31, 2022), as part of  the collective  pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription:\n\n- \u25a0 the total amount paid corresponds to around 14.3% of the target annual fixed and variable remuneration for 2022;\n- \u25a0 in the event of a conversion of the capital paid to the insurer into a life annuity, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's rights under this scheme are estimated, at December 31, 2022, and including the payment to be made in 2023 in respect of the 2022 fiscal year, at 4,045 euros gross per year.\n\n## B.  Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\n## 1. Termination indemnities\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, who decided to end his employment contract unilaterally as of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, benefits from a termination indemnity, subject to very strict triggering conditions similar to those that applied to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis scheme was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, and approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 as part of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration policy (15 th resolution).\n\nThe main terms of the termination indemnity applicable to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only the cases of forced departure of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow from his term of office as Chief Executive Officer (removal from office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at 24 months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration actually paid (24 months of fixed remuneration + last two annual variable remuneration amounts actually paid) on the date of termination of his duties (subject to the exceptions described below and in paragraph B.2). As an exception to this rule, in the event of departure during the course of the 2022 fiscal year, the amount of indemnity would have been limited to 12 months of fixed and variable remuneration (sum of the annual fixed remuneration for 2022 and the target annual variable remuneration for 2022); in the event of departure during the two following fiscal years (2023 or 2024), for the calculation of the indemnity of 24 months of fixed and variable remuneration, will be taken into account, concerning the variable remuneration, the target variable remuneration awarded in the absence of variable remuneration paid in respect of a fiscal year (for each fiscal year concerned), and the annual fixed remuneration of the ongoing fiscal year and that of the previous fiscal year;",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit set by the articles of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity\n\nThe payment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance, defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed using the net equity  method),  calculated  (on  the  basis of  the certified  Consolidated  financial  statements, approved by the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.\n\nGiven the fundamental importance, in the highly capital-intensive industrial gas industry, of the management and control of investment processes, this gap makes it possible to measure the regular creation of value over the three years prior to the departure.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n(a)\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                              | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                              | 0%                            |\n\n## 2. Indemnity relating to a non competition commitment\n\nAs Chief  Executive Officer, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow receives  a  non-competition indemnity  in  exchange  for  his commitment not  to serve, directly or indirectly,  a business competing with that of the Group, for a period of two years from the date of termination of his term of office.\n\nThis scheme, authorized by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022 and approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 as part of the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer (15 th resolution), was put in place to protect the Company's legitimate interests.\n\nThe amount of this indemnity, payable monthly, would be equal to one year of gross annual fixed and variable remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer (excluding sums received in respect of long-term variable remuneration), wherein the aggregated termination indemnity and non-competition indemnity are capped at 24 months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer on the date on which he ends his term of office.\n\nPayment of the non-competition indemnity shall not apply from the moment the Chief Executive Officer exercises his pension entitlements. In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond age 65.\n\nThe Board of Directors reserves the right to fully or partially waive the non-competition commitment upon the departure of the Chief Executive Officer, in which case no indemnity will be owed.\n\n## 3. Unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers\n\nAs a Company Officer and in view of the fact that he decided to terminate his employment contract as from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefits from the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company since June 1, 2022.\n\nThis scheme was authorized by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2022 and approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 as part of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration policy (15 th resolution).\n\nThe contributions paid by the Company under this scheme are included in Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's remuneration as benefits in kind.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Fixed remuneration\n\nIn  accordance  with  the policy  approved  by the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022,  the  fixed  remuneration  was determined  taking  into account the specific role of the Chairman of the Board of Directors in a context of managerial succession and the missions that the Board of  Directors  wished  to  entrust Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for  the  duration  of  the  transition  in  order  to  benefit from his  experience, his  in-depth knowledge of the Group and its businesses, its Shareholders and stakeholders and its strategic challenges.\n\nAs announced, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier's annual fixed remuneration for 2022 amounts to 800,000 euros. For the 2022 fiscal year, the latter, calculated on a pro rata basis for the period from June 1 to December 31, 2022, amounts to a total of 466,667 euros.\n\n## 2.3.2.  Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier exercised his rights to mandatory retirement as from the termination of his duties as Chief Executive Officer, as well as his rights acquired under the various supplementary pension schemes set up within the Company with the exception of the collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional enrollment (see below). No new amounts are due from the Company in respect of the pension rights of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors has a company car as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Death and disability benefits plan\n\nIn  respect  of  his  duties  as  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr  Beno\u00eet Potier benefited, until May 31, 2022, from the additional 'incapacity, disability, death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the corporate officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such plan. The continuation of this insurance plan (life insurance only) for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, from his  appointment  as  Chairman  of the  Board  of  Directors,  was  authorized  by  the  Board of Directors on February  15, 2022, and approved by the General Meeting as part of the remuneration policy for the Chairman of the Board (16 th resolution).\n\nThis unified pension plan provides, in particular, for life insurance:\n\n- \u25a0 the  granting to beneficiaries  of  a death benefit, the  maximum  amount of which  is  set  at  120 times the  PASS in  the event  of  an accident;\n\nThe life insurance contract entered into with the insurer specifies the limits of the benefits for the same insured party:\n\n- \u25a0 full coverage  by  the Company  of  contributions  calculated  as  a  percentage  of the  Reference Remuneration, which is capped  at 24 times the PASS for the death benefit.\n\nThe contribution rate for 2022 amounts to 1.10% of the Reference Remuneration up to 16 PASS and to 0.89% between 16 and 24 PASS. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base, are subject to the social levy at a rate of 8%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of an amount equal to the sum of 6% of the PASS and 1.5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of 12% of the PASS.\n\nThe contribution paid by L'Air Liquide S.A. in 2022, for the period from June 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022, in respect of the death and disability benefits plan for the benefit of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, amounts to 5,932 euros and this amount is also disclosed in the footnotes to Table 2 - supra).\n\n## 2.4. REMUNERATION RATIOS - ANNUAL VARIATION IN THE REMUNERATION, PERFORMANCE AND RATIOS\n\nPursuant to article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code, the ratios between the level of remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors (and of the Senior Executive Vice President for  the  period  of exercise  of  this  mandate)  and  the  average and median remunerations (19) of L'Air Liquide S.A.'s  employees  are disclosed  below, as  well as,  where applicable,  their annual change  and the  change  in  the  Company's performances  and  in  the average remuneration of the Company's employees over the five most recent fiscal years. To take into account the comments of certain  investors along with  the AMF  and  the Haut  Comit\u00e9  de  gouvernement  d'entreprise  (French  High  Committee on  Corporate Governance), the following table includes a comparison (since the previous year) with the 'whole of France' consolidated scope. This scope represents more than 95% of the employees present in France. The calculations for this scope are given for four fiscal years for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (i.e. 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022) and only for the past fiscal year for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nIt is specified that in order to comply with the spirit of the AFEP guidelines, allow a relevant comparison with employees, and ensure continuity in the information communicated in successive Universal Registration Documents, the remuneration of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (who held these positions until May 31, 2022), as well as of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors (who held these positions from June 1, 2022) have been annualized.\n\n(19)\n\n<!-- image -->",

This amount stands at 101,137 euros in respect of the period from June 1 to December 31, 2022 and is intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract. Taking this amount into consideration, the ratios for 2022 for the Company amount to 34 (remuneration ratio compared to the employee  average) and 49 (remuneration ratio compared  to  the employee median),  and to 67 for the whole of France  scope (remuneration ratio compared to the employee average in France), i.e. a low impact.",

The Chief Executive Officer, since his appointment effective June 1, 2022, does not receive any remuneration in respect of his office as Director.\n\nWithin the scope of the agreement entered into with the various stakeholders and pursuant to the provisions in force at the Group, which apply to all employees who serve on the Boards of Directors of Group companies, it was agreed that the employee Directors would not receive any remuneration for their office as Director (1) .\n\n## 3.2. CRITERIA\n\nThe maximum amount of the sum to be allocated in total to the members of the Board of Directors was set by the General Meeting on May 5, 2020 at 1.3 million euros per fiscal year (12 th resolution).\n\nAs per the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting on May 4,  2022,  the  formula for  allocating  Directors'  remuneration seeks to  ensure pay is  competitive with  international peers to attract the best  and most suitable talent and  expertise, in accordance with the Board's diversity policy .\n\nIt  comprises fixed remuneration and variable remuneration based on lump-sum amounts per meeting, thereby taking into account the actual participation of each Director in the work of the Board and its Committees/working group , as well as a fixed amount per trip for  Directors  traveling  from  abroad. The variable remuneration for participation at  the  Board and Committee meetings is more important than the fixed remuneration.\n\nPursuant to the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2021, (i) the fixed remuneration allocated to Committee Chairs has now been harmonized, as their functions involve significantly  comparable responsibilities, likewise  the amount of  the remuneration allocated for attending each Committee meeting and (ii) remote attendance of meetings is remunerated in the same way as attending in person in order to take into account the quality of means of communication allowing members connecting via video-conference to attend meetings and take part in discussions under conditions that are equivalent to them being physically present at meetings. While it does not alter the preference of the Board and its members to attend meetings in person where possible, it recognizes the advances in communication technologies. Since the end of the health crisis, meetings have been held mainly in person.\n\nFor 2022 , the amounts applied, unchanged since last year, break down as follows:\n\n## 3.2.1.  Fixed remuneration (for an entire fiscal year)\n\n- \u25a0 Each member receives fixed annual remuneration set at 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Chairs of the Audit and Accounts Committee, the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Environment and Society Committee receive additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n- \u25a0 The Lead Director receives additional fixed annual remuneration of 20,000 euros.\n\n## 3.2.2.  Variable remuneration\n\nAttendance at the various meetings is remunerated as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 a meeting of the Board of Directors\n\n5,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 a meeting of the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\n4,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 a meeting of the Appointments and Governance Committee\n\n4,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 a meeting of the Remuneration Committee\n\n4,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 a meeting of the Environment and Society Committee\n\n4,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 a joint session of the Audit Committee and the Environment and Society Committee\n\n4,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 a meeting of the Working Group 'Shareholder Relations'\n\n3,500 euros\n\n- \u25a0 one trip for a non-resident:\n- - in Europe\n\n3,000 euros\n\n- - Intercontinental\n\n6,000 euros\n\nTravel expenses incurred by non-French residents at the time of their trips to meetings are reimbursed by the Company.",

This indicator has improved compared to 2021, with a significant reduction (-11%) in the number of workplace accidents involving Group employees. A similar trend can be observed for subcontractors. Overall, 26 fewer people (whether employees or subcontractors) were injured in connection with Group activities in 2022, by comparison with 2021.\n\n2022 was marked by the death of a subcontracted driver involving a road traffic accident. For the record, 2021 had been marked by the deaths of four subcontractors.\n\nIn  2022,  under Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier's supervision, the  main  safety programs  launched  in previous years were continued, notably the IMS Streamlining program, the major cornerstone of industrial safety management for the Group. In this post-Covid period, the main focus was on continuity. Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, together with all the Executive Committee members, paid considerable attention to Process Safety issues, notably by monitoring the implementation of an ambitious plan to upgrade more than 600 air separation units. It made it possible to improve safety at the Group's production sites. Its implementation continued in 2022. Almost all of the 600 units will have been upgraded over the course of these three years. The remaining units concerned will be upgraded at the start of 2023. It can be noted that Air Liquide played a leading role in influencing its peers and inviting them to work together to develop harmonized international standards for everyone's benefit.\n\n## \u25a0 Roll-out of Action plans linked to the Group's new sustainability objectives; Progress made on the various key indicators and alignment with the 2025 trajectory linked to these objectives\n\nThe ADVANCE Plan communicated in March 2022 confirmed the positioning of sustainable development issues at the heart of the Group's development strategy, following on from the ACT program announced by Mr Beno\u00eet Potier at the Sustainability Day on March 23, 2021.\n\nBased on its  climate  commitment  and the  first stages  of  its  implementation, the  CDP awarded Air Liquide, in January 2022, the highest level ('Leadership Level') for its environmental commitment,  which includes some of the  most ambitious sustainability objectives in the sector.\n\nIn 2022, work continued and considerable progress has been made, with regard to each of the ACT program commitments.\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE",

Annual  CO2  budgets, which may be positive or negative depending on local factors, are now allocated to the  operating  entities  every  year  and  instruments  have  been  in  place  for  quarterly monitoring of compliance with these budgets and the impact of the activities on the 2025 Carbon trajectory since the start of the year.\n\nDuring the first half, several projects were launched that contribute to the decarbonization of the Group's assets or those of its customers, and renewable energy supply agreements started to be signed around the world, following on from the previous fiscal year (construction by Air Liquide of its largest biomethane production unit in the world in the United States; memoranda of understanding signed in South Korea to explore the use of hydrogen in the decarbonization of the aviation industry,  and the development of  the hydrogen supply  chain for  mobility  markets; development of hydrogen mobility in Europe; development of shipping solutions for carbon management; execution of a ten-year renewable energy purchase agreement in  Italy  in  May  2022 with Shell Energy Europe Limited). In March 2022, Air Liquide received support from the French State for its 200 MW electrolyzer project in Normandy for which it has requested a substantial  European  subsidy  and,  in April 2022, the project to transform EQIOM's Lumbres plant, in the Hauts-de-France region, into one of the first carbon-neutral cement plants in Europe, was selected by the European Commission for funding through its Innovation Fund.\n\nIn May 2022, Air  Liquide's  trajectory  to  reduce CO2 by 2035 was validated by  the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being in line with a 'below 2\u00b0' Scenario consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nFinally, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier pursued his actions and maintained his involvement on the Hydrogen Council, which he co-chaired for 5 years up until the end of 2021, and for which he is now the official representative in Europe, and on the National Hydrogen Council of which he is co-Chair. He continued to play an active role in the work of the ERT (European Round Table), notably on topics related to the energy transition and Hydrogen.\n\n## -Act for Health:\n\nPursuant to the  ADVANCE Plan, the Group's objective in Mature Countries is to improve  the  quality  of  life of patients  living at home with  chronic diseases.  In  this sector,  the  teams  have continued  to  develop personalized  care  pathways  that  are tailored to comply  with  local  regulations.  The proportion  of  patients  receiving  care who benefited from these pathways increased significantly over the fiscal year.\n\nIn low and middle-income countries, the objective is to provide an increasing number of people with access to medical oxygen. Once again, thanks to new projects, notably in South Africa, the number of people benefiting from the 'Access Oxygen' program increased in line with the previous fiscal year.\n\n## -Act for the whole of Society:\n\nThe programs  to  increase  gender diversity  within  the population  of  Managers  and Professionals continued, even if the result obtained of 31.5%, at the end of 2022, is slightly lower than that expected for 2022, and the objective is not called into question.\n\nThe objective has been set  to  extend  a common basic social  security  cover to  all employees and the roll-out of the Citizen  at  Work  program,  allowing  employees  to participate  in social  or societal projects during their  working hours,  has  also  been determined and is well on track.\n\nThe progress described above confirms that the Group has been well-positioned, since the start of 2022, with regard to the various pillars of the ACT Plan, in line with the stated goals for 2025.",

At the same time, substantial work was carried out in the first part of the year to prepare for the changeover of management. The Human Resources objectives of the ADVANCE plan were finalized in close collaboration with Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and the talent management policy, in line with earlier reviews, was also transferred, in particular to anticipate changes in management teams. Close attention was paid to the changes to the Executive Committee, in preparation for the handover to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow and the transfer of his previous responsibilities, with notably the appointment of Mr. Ronnie Chalmers, Vice President of the Africa, Middle-East and India hub, as a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nNumerous specific  'Handover'  sessions  were organized on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure a smooth transition and in particular the handover of subjects that were not previously under the responsibility of Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his role as Executive Vice President.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nMr Beno\u00eet  Potier's  individual  performance  is  considered excellent  despite a  mixed global context (start  of  the  war  in  Ukraine,  inflation,  energy  crisis\u2026).  His  efforts  to  achieve  the Group's  objectives  while at the  same  time  preparing for  his succession, the  handover  of responsibilities and the implementation of the new governance were highly successful. Performance in this regard was assessed at 100%.\n\nTherefore,  the  total  amount  of the  variable  remuneration is  above  target  and amounts to 921,979 euros, up by  0.91% on an annualized basis as compared to the variable remuneration for 2021. This variation between 2021 and 2022 is the result of exceeding the financial targets for the year 2022 slightly more than the same excess in 2021.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2022 fiscal year will be paid in 2023, after approval of the financial statements by the General Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on the approval by a General Meeting of the elements of remuneration paid during or awarded in respect of the 2022 fiscal year to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, in his quality as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nFor the record, the variable remuneration paid in 2022 in respect of 2021 totaled 2,192,875  euros.  It  was paid  following  approval of the  resolution  relating to elements of remuneration paid or awarded to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for 2021 (12 th resolution) by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nThere is no deferred annual variable remuneration mechanism, multi-annual variable remuneration mechanism or exceptional remuneration.",

This amount will be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nThe performance conditions that apply are similar to those that applied to the defined benefit plan: the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year depends on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net  equity  method), calculated  (on the  basis  of  the  certified  Consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract is determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segment between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC)  over three years in bps  (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                    | 100 %                                                    |\n| 250                                                                      | 66 %                                                     |\n| 200                                                                      | 50 %                                                     |\n| 100                                                                      | 25 %                                                     |\n| < 100                                                                    | 0 %                                                      |\n\n(a) bps: basis points.\n\nIn  respect of 2022,  the Board  of Directors on  February  15, 2023 took  note  of the  100% achievement of the performance conditions.\n\nAccordingly, the amount to be paid in 2023 in respect of fiscal year 2022 under the pension scheme with individual and optional subscription, for the period January 1, 2022 to May 31, 2022, will amount overall to 141,667 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved  by the  General Meeting of  May 4, 2022, between  a payment of  70,834 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 70,834 euros (gross) to  Mr Beno\u00eet  Potier  intended to cover the  social security  contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nFor the  record,  the amount of  contributions  paid in 2022 (in respect of 2021)  under this scheme in favor of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier is  340,000 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, between a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 170,000 euros (gross) to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nPension commitment pursuant to a defined contribution pension plan (\"PERO\")\n\nMr Beno\u00eet Potier benefits from the 'PERO' defined contribution pension plan which applies to all the employees and the Company Officers, contributions to which are paid in equal shares by the employer and the beneficiary on the fraction of remuneration which does not exceed eight times the annual social security ceiling (PASS).

This indicator has improved compared to 2021, with a significant reduction (-11%) in the number of workplace accidents involving Group employees. A similar trend can be observed for subcontractors. Overall, 26 fewer people (whether employees or subcontractors) were injured in connection with Group activities in 2022, by comparison with 2021.\n\n2022 was marked by the death of a subcontracted driver involving a road traffic accident. For the record, 2021 had been marked by the deaths of four subcontractors.\n\nSince taking office, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow has constantly stressed the importance of safety, notably during his numerous site visits in Operations, as shown in the video made during his  trip to Poland on  June 1, 2022.  These  opportunities  have  enabled  him to promote the Group's Safety Culture, taking advantage of each of these visits to initiate a dialogue on safety with the employees encountered.\n\nHe has also regularly  reiterated,  for  example  in  the editorial  he  wrote for  the  Group's HSE newsletter published in September, that the goal of 'zero accidents' for employees and partners remains the Group's top priority.\n\nIn  terms  of action  plans,  he  built  on  previous  programs,  stressing  the  need  to remain focused in order to bring them to a successful conclusion, before launching other major projects. Accordingly, he continued to supervise, both personally and together with all the Executive Committee members, the progress of the IMS Streamlining program and the plan to upgrade more than 600 air separation units. In four years, more than 600 units will have been upgraded. It can be noted that  Air Liquide played a leading role in influencing its peers and inviting them to work together to develop harmonized international standards for everyone's benefit.\n\nIn addition, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow regularly reiterated the importance of Road Safety in Air Liquide Operations, notably at the Group Management Meeting in October 2022, where he confirmed  his support  and  involvement  in the  roll-out of the  Group's Road  Safety action plan.\n\nFinally, in addition to these main programs, actions aimed at improving the understanding of major industrial risks were initiated in the second half of 2022, in order to enhance the safety culture among Air Liquide employees; these actions will be rolled out across the Group over the course of 2023 and 2024.",

Annual CO2 budgets, which may  be  positive  or  negative  depending  on local  factors,  are  now  allocated  to  the operating entities every year. Each quarter, compliance with these budgets and the impact of activities on the 2025 Carbon trajectory are analyzed and presented to the Executive Committee. The Group's CO2 emissions are also reported and consolidated each quarter.\n\nDuring the second half, several new projects were signed that contribute to the decarbonization of the Group's assets or those of its customers, together with projects for the production of low-carbon hydrogen, demonstrating the proactive implementation of the Climate objectives announced by the Group (agreement with TotalEnergie in November 2022 to produce and recover renewable, low-carbon hydrogen for the Grandpuits refinery using innovative processes; the first contracts for the production of carbon-free hydrogen in China; obtaining European subsidies for a project to  decarbonize  the Antwerp port platform and the  backing of  the Dutch government for two major electrolyzer projects in the Netherlands in December 2022). In addition, the signing of long-term renewable energy supply agreements has accelerated (e.g. the execution by AL of its largest renewable energy supply agreement in the Netherlands in June 2022).\n\nActive communication was also maintained concerning hydrogen as an accelerator of the energy transition (the Hydrogen Generation broadcast on September 28, 2022).\n\nFinally,  all the  extra-financial  ratings obtained  were  stable in  2022  or improved  by comparison with the previous fiscal year. Air Liquide was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe index for the first time.\n\n## -ACT for Health :\n\nThe Group's objective in Mature Countries is to improve the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases. In this sector, the Healthcare teams continued to develop personalized care pathways that are tailored to comply with local regulations. The proportion of patients receiving care who benefited from these pathways increased significantly over the fiscal year.\n\nIn low and middle-income countries, the objective is to provide an increasing number of people with access to medical oxygen. Once again, thanks to new projects, notably in South Africa, the number of people benefiting from the 'Access Oxygen' program increased over the course of the fiscal year.\n\n## -ACT for the whole of Society :\n\nThe programs  to  increase  gender diversity  within  the population  of  Managers  and Professionals continued, even if the result obtained of 31.5%, at the end of 2022, is slightly lower than expected for 2022, and the objective is not called into question.\n\nOn the other hand, the generalization of a common basic social security cover for all employees and the roll-out of the Citizen  at  Work  program,  allowing  employees  to participate in social or societal projects during their working hours, saw considerable progress throughout the fiscal  year and are currently ahead of the 2025 roadmap. Roll-out of care coverage at the end of 2022 has already reached 42%.\n\nThe action and progress described above confirm that, thanks to a structured and proactive implementation of the objectives set, the Group is well-positioned with regard to the various pillars of the ACT Commitments, in line with the 2025 trajectory for these new objectives.",

As  in previous years, these reviews were conducted at the level of our operational clusters right up  to the  Executive Committee.  Special focus was  placed  on international development opportunities  in the  context  of  reduced  mobility  due to the  Covid  crisis.  The  diversity of profiles was also carefully reviewed, in order to promote the many cultures within the Group at key positions, and to continue to improve the gender balance.\n\nA detailed review of our top international talent took place with the  Appointments and Governance Committee in the second half of 2022, in order to prepare for future changes in management.\n\nSpecific attention was paid to the review of the technical talent (appointments through the TCL program) as well as to commercial profiles, with the involvement of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in recognizing the Key Account salespeople at the dedicated international meeting.\n\nIn addition, a review was carried out with the Board of Directors of our talent policy and its implementation in current market conditions (tight labor market, new technological challenges, new ways of working), together notably with the developments that are required for the Hydrogen market.\n\nAlongside the work on governance and preparation for  the  succession  to  the Company's General Management, close attention was paid to the Executive Committee's work. In June, a dedicated session lasting several days was organized with the support of external partners, in  order  to  define  how the  Executive Committee will  operate  under  M.  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's leadership. Changes have also been made to the Executive Committee, notably with  the appointment  of  Ronnie  Chalmers,  Vice President  of  the Africa, Middle-East  and India hub, as well as adjustments to some members' perimeters.\n\nMoreover, in connection with his taking office, in addition to the 'handover' sessions, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow organized numerous trips within the Group (in particular to Asia and the Americas) in order to meet the teams directly in the field in as short a timeframe as possible, including notably those teams who did not come under his responsibility in his former roles.\n\nAt Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's request, Executive Committee sessions were dedicated to diversity issues during the review of the ESG objectives and, more broadly, to our inclusion policy. Gender equality targets were reviewed, as  well as their implementation throughout the Group, and Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow expressed his strong commitment concerning the policy for the inclusion of disabled workers, notably at the various events organized during Disability Week.\n\n## Individual performance:\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's individual performance is considered remarkable. At the pivotal moment of the succession and his taking up office, in a macroeconomic environment marked by an unprecedented increase in costs, notably energy costs, and an unfavorable geopolitical situation,  he demonstrated  strong  commitment  to the  Group's success  while also expressing  his  gratitude  to  the teams. Performance in  this  regard  was  assessed at 110%.\n\nIn total, the amount of the variable part of the remuneration is above target and amounts to 912,450 euros.\n\nThe total amount of the variable remuneration due for the 2022 fiscal year will be paid in 2023, after approval of the financial statements by the General Meeting, it being noted that its payment is conditional on the approval by a General Meeting of the elements of remuneration paid  during or awarded  in respect of the 2022 fiscal  year  to Mr  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThere is no deferred annual variable remuneration mechanism, multi-annual variable remuneration mechanism or exceptional remuneration.",

Moreover, for the record, since 2019, the Board of Directors decided, following the general market trend,  to grant  only performance  shares (instead of a mix of stock  options  and performance  shares) to all  the  beneficiaries, in  order to simplify  and standardize  the LTI scheme.\n\n## Limits on the grants to Executive Officers\n\nWithin  the  scope  of  the  sub-limits  authorized  by  the  General  Meeting  for  38  months,  the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe limits set by the Board of Directors for 2022 are identical to those for 2021 and are as follows (no subscription option having been attributed in 2022):\n\n- \u25a0 the total number of performance shares granted in 2022 to the Executive Officer cannot give rise to a number of shares exceeding 0.012% of the share capital (it being understood that an allocation sub-limit of 0.1% of the share capital for 38 months was set by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022);\n- \u25a0 the total aggregate IFRS  value of  the performance shares granted  to the Executive Officer cannot exceed approximately 1.5  times the  amount of the  Executive Officer's maximum gross annual remuneration (fixed + variable maximum), it being noted that the performance shares  granted represent approximately  40% of  the total target annual remuneration.\n\n## Maintaining the proration principle\n\nPursuant to the decision made by the Board on February 15, 2022 and the policy approved by the  General  Meeting on May 4,  2022,  the  2022  grant of LTI to the  Executive  Officer remains subject to the principle of a pro-rata calculation.\n\nIn practice, if the Executive Officer leaves the Group for a reason other than his resignation or removal from office for serious cause, the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro rata for the duration of actual presence of the Executive Officer within the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria. Furthermore, no grant is made to the Executive Officer at the time of this departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Executive Officer will remain subject to all the provisions of the plans and, more specifically, those relating  to  the duration of  the vesting,  lock-up  and holding periods  in respect of the shares and stock options granted.\n\n## Performance conditions\n\nThe performance shares awarded are all accompanied by performance conditions calculated over three years. They are calculated:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the performance shares granted , on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the  Return on  Capital Employed after tax ( ROCE ) (c) recorded at the end of the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nAt the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to a ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than the objective set, which provides a degree of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective has been set within the trajectory of the ROCE target announced by the Company that is maintained  at  more than  10%,  with achievement  set  for  2023-2024, which reflects the impact of the crisis but also a proactive investment policy in a context of numerous and qualitative opportunities notably in relation to the energy transition;",

These emissions are accounted for as \"market based\".\n\n## Other conditions/shareholding obligation\n\nThe shareholding obligation defined pursuant to the French Commercial Code is completed by an internal rule which requires Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow to hold a number of shares which is equivalent to twice his annual gross fixed remuneration. The evaluation of the application of this rule for Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will therefore take place as of July 1, 2026.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  has made a  commitment  not to carry out  any  hedging  transactions during his term of office.\n\n## Plan Regulations\n\nThe 'France' performance share plan comprises a three-year vesting period, followed by a two-year holding period during which the shares cannot be transferred, as well as a condition of continued presence.\n\n| Other elements              | N/A    | No allocation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-----------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Remuneration as  a Director | N/A    | Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow does not receive any remuneration in respect of his term of office as  Director.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Other benefits              | \u20ac7,956 | Benefits  in  kind  (accounting  valuation)  include  the  use  of  a  company  car  and  the  contributions  paid  in  2022  to  an  external  organization  for  unemployment  insurance  for  company managers and  corporate  officers  calculated  pro  rata  to  the  performance  of  the  duties of Chief Executive Officer (i.e. for the period from June 1 st  to December 31, 2022). |\n\n- (c) For the purposes hereof, the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) is calculated as follows: ((recurring net profit after tax before deduction of minority interests - cost of net debt after taxes) for the period 2024)/(weighted average of (shareholders' equity + minority interests + net debt) at the end of the last three half years (H2 2024, H1 2024, H2 2023)).",

As  this  system  is  not applicable to Company Officers, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow could no longer benefit from it as of his appointment as a Company Officer.\n\nTo replace this, from June 1, 2022 until the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefits from a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional enrollment (known as 'article 82 of the French General Tax Code') for the reference portion of his  remuneration  [fixed  remuneration  +  target variable remuneration] exceeding eight times the PASS.\n\nImplementation of this scheme for the benefit of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow was approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 pursuant to the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer (15 th resolution).\n\nIn this scheme, the amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount will be paid in arrears every year for the period until the end of the executive office. These contributions are deductible from the corporate income tax base and are subject to social security contributions.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract in the form of capital and/or life annuity before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nThis supplementary pension plan for the fraction of remuneration exceeding 8 PASS is entirely subject to performance conditions. The total amount of contributions for a fiscal year depends on the  average annual gap between  the Return on  Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis  of the  certified  Consolidated  financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC is measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps is calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nThe performance coefficient applied to the nominal amount pursuant to the collective pension insurance contract is determined as shown in the table below, with a growth of the increase per linear segment between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC)  over three years in bps (a)   | Performance coefficient applied to  the nominal amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                                   | 100 %                                                    |\n| 250                                                                     | 66 %                                                     |\n| 200                                                                     | 50 %                                                     |\n| 100                                                                     | 25 %                                                     |\n| < 100                                                                   | 0 %                                                      |\n\n(a) bps: basis points.\n\nIn  respect of 2022,  the Board  of Directors on  February  15, 2023 took  note  of the  100% achievement of the performance conditions.\n\nAccordingly, the amount to be paid in 2023 in respect of fiscal year 2022 under the pension scheme with individual and optional subscription, for the period June 1 st , 2022 to December 31, 2022, will amount overall to 202,274 euros (split, in accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, between a payment of 101,137 (gross) to the insurer in the form of an insurance premium, and a payment of 101,137 euros (gross) to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to cover the social security contributions and similar charges and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer).\n\nSupplementary pension plans",

These contributions were set at 2.7% of the portion of remuneration that is lower than eight times the PASS. Furthermore, they are subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid under the PERO set up for the benefit of all the staff (see above).\n\nThe contributions paid by the Company in 2022, for the period from June 1 to December 31, 2022, in favor of Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, amounted to 5,183 euros.\n\nAs an employee, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefited until May 31, 2022, from the additional 'incapacity, disability,  death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all personnel and corporate officers who are duly authorized to benefit from such plan. Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow also benefited from the healthcare cost plan covering all employees.

Remuneration policy applicable to corporate officers\n\n## (submitted for the approval of the General Meeting pursuant to article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code)\n\nIn accordance with article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code, the remuneration policy applicable to the corporate officers of L'Air Liquide S.A., as established by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023 and described in this section, is submitted for approval by the General  Meeting on  May  3,  2023,  in  the  15 th resolution  and 16 th resolution  for  the  Company  Officers (section 5.1  below)  and  in the 17 th resolution for the Directors (section 5.2 below).\n\n## 5.1. REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO COMPANY OFFICERS\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to Company Officers presented below is part of the governance framework that came into force on June 1, 2022, which separates the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to Company Officers described below and subject to the approval of the General Meeting breaks down as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer (applicable, in 2023, to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow); and\n- \u25a0 the remuneration policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors (applicable, in 2023, to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier).\n\nThis remuneration policy for Company Officers was established by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nDuring this work, the Company Officers do not attend deliberations by the Remuneration Committee relating to their personal case and do not take part in deliberations or votes by the Board of Directors on the remuneration components that concern them. The decision-making process followed to determine the policy is also applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\nTo determine the remuneration policy, the Board of Directors takes into account the principles of completeness, balance, comparability, consistency, comprehensibility and proportionality as recommended by the AFEP/MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance.\n\nThis policy is in line with that approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nBoth in terms of structure and level, the remuneration policy for Company Officers was therefore established in accordance with Group practices, its new governance context and market practices. It is competitive and aligned with the Group's strategy and medium- and longterm objectives.\n\n## 5.1.1.  Remuneration policy applicable to Executive Officers\n\n## A.  General principles\n\nIn  keeping  with  the Group's  practices,  the remuneration  policy applicable  to  Executive  Officers determined  by  the  Board of Directors includes incentive elements reflecting the Group's strategy, which is steered toward profitable long-term growth by acting on behalf of a sustainable  future,  with regard  to  the  corporate interest and the interests  of all  the  stakeholders. In  a  highly  capital-intensive  industry, profitable long-term growth  requires  constant attention to be paid to each  investment decision and  to the competitiveness  of every operation, while maintaining an ongoing effort over time in favor, in particular, of safety and security, innovation, employee development, and environmental and societal stakes. It incorporates, both in the short-term variable element and in the long-term incentive elements, criteria aligned with the ADVANCE strategic plan combining financial and extra-financial performance. It is tailored to the Group's specific situation, reflects the level of responsibility of Group executives and remains competitive. In this context, the elements taken into account for the determination of the remuneration of the Executive Officers are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 an annual short-term component, comprising a fixed remuneration and a variable remuneration;\n- \u25a0 a long-term incentive (hereafter 'LTI') through the grant of performance shares and/or stock options, both subject in full to performance conditions calculated over three years;\n- \u25a0 other benefits attached to the performance of the Executive Officer's term of office, specifically including:\n- -a supplementary pension scheme,\n- -additional social coverage in terms of death and disability benefits and healthcare expenses,\n- -benefits in kind (including unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers),\n- -commitments in the event of termination of duties (indemnity in the event of cessation of functions at the Company's initiative in certain very limited circumstances, subject to performance conditions calculated over three years and, as the case may be, a noncompetition indemnity).\n\nThere are no employment contracts between the Executive Officer  and  any  of  the  Group's  companies. Thus, just  as  Mr  Beno\u00eet  Potier resigned from his employment contract in May 2010, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow unilaterally terminated his employment contract by resignation when his term of office as Chief Executive Officer came into effect on June 1, 2022.\n\nFurthermore, if such a situation were to arise, the remuneration applicable to a Senior Executive Vice President would be determined on the basis of the policy applicable to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, after taking into account, however, of the difference in profile, experience, and level of responsibility, consistent with the earlier practices applied at the Company for this type of Company Officer.",

Structure and main characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers\n- A. The structure and principles applicable to the remuneration are in line with previous years and with the policy approved in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u25a0 The remuneration policy provides for a proportionate balance between the three components of the total annual remuneration (i.e.  the fixed remuneration, the  variable  remuneration and  the long-term incentives,  comprising  performance shares and/or stock options).\n- (i) The fixed remuneration represents approximately 25%, the variable remuneration approximately 35% and the LTI approximately 40% of the target total annual remuneration. The elements subject to performance conditions represent in principle approximately 75% of this total target remuneration. The achievement of each performance condition is assessed without any setoff between criteria.\n- (ii) The variable remuneration continues to be expressed as a target variable remuneration (as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) with a maximum . The total target variable remuneration set now represents approximately 80% of the Chief Executive Officer's total maximum variable remuneration, for a very good performance.\n- \u25a0 The annual variable remuneration includes quantifiable and qualitative criteria.\n- B. Regarding the weighting of criteria chosen, a greater relative weight is given to the quantifiable criteria as compared to the qualitative criteria.\n\nThe target weighting and the maximum weighting are made public ex-ante and appear below (paragraph 5.1.2); the actual weight of each criterion for the  determination  of  the variable  remuneration due in respect of  the fiscal  year  will be  established on  the basis of the performance measured for each criterion in light of the target objective, on the basis of the application of a formula for the financial criteria and the assessment of the Executive Officer's performance by the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee for the qualitative criteria.\n\nThe rate of achievement of the objectives for the variable remuneration, expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to the criterion, will be made public ex-post.\n\nThe quantifiable elements of the annual variable remuneration include, as in 2022:\n\n- \u25a0 a  criterion  of  an  increase  in  the  recurring net  earnings  (excluding  exceptional and significant  transactions  which do not  impact  the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact, per share (hereinafter 'recurring EPS'), which makes it possible to take into account all the items in the income statement;\n- \u25a0 a criterion of comparable growth in consolidated revenue (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of currency and energy), which reflects the momentum of the activity.\n- The two criteria of the recurring EPS and the revenue reflect the Group's strategy to achieve profitable growth taking into account medium and long-term objectives. The efficiency objective contributes to the increase in the recurring EPS.\n\nEach quantifiable criterion is assigned a target weighting (expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration) corresponding to a 100% achievement of the target objective set at the beginning of the year, and a maximum weighting (also expressed as a percentage of the fixed remuneration). For each quantifiable criterion, the Board of Directors has defined an exacting target objective, which is not made public  for  confidentiality reasons.  Nonetheless,  the  rate  of  achievement of the  objectives  for  the variable remuneration  as a percentage of the fixed remuneration and as a percentage of the target variable remuneration allocated to that criterion is made public ex-post.\n\nFor each quantifiable criterion, a formula adopted by the Board of Directors makes it possible to calculate the amount of the variable remuneration due (within a maximum limit) by taking into account, on the basis of the Consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year, the value achieved for the criterion as compared to the target objective set. Thus, in the event of a performance that exceeds the objective set,  the  value of the  variable  part  is adjusted upward within  the maximum limit set for  each criterion.  In  the event of a performance that is below the lower limit set for each objective, the variable remuneration corresponding to this criterion is equal to zero.\n\nThe qualitative elements of the  annual variable remuneration continue to be based, for two-thirds, on  several categories or subcategories of objectives which are defined each year and, for one-third, on an assessment of the individual performance. For 2023, they include the pursuit of long-term objectives related to safety, sustainable development objectives linked to the ESG objectives announced by the Group on March 23, 2021 ('ACT for a sustainable future') and forming an integral part of the ADVANCE strategic program, and organization and Human Resources, thus supporting the Company's sustainability and reflecting its extra-financial performance objectives.\n\nThe grant of LTI to the Executive Officers is  examined by the Remuneration Committee at the same time as the allocation to Group employees and is decided by the Board of Directors. It is made within the scope of plans, adopted at pre-established periods in autumn, in the form of performance shares and/or share subscription options granted without any discount. It is examined in light of the total amount of the Executive Officer's annual remuneration, taking into account several external market surveys and ensuring that the interests of the Shareholders are respected.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\nAccording to the principle that has been adopted since 2016, the award of LTI to the Executive Officer and its evolution over time are assessed in terms  of the  IFRS value  (and not  in  terms of the volumes granted), for all  stock  option  and  performance share plans combined.\n\nWithin the scope of the sub-limits authorized by the General Meeting, the Board of Directors sets lower annual limits for the grants to the Executive Officers, expressed (i) as a percentage of the share capital and for each Executive Officer (ii) as a multiple of their remuneration, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nThe total aggregate IFRS value of the LTI granted cannot exceed 1.5 times the amount of the Executive Officer's maximum gross annual remuneration (maximum annual fixed +  variable), it  being  noted  moreover that,  in  accordance  with the  relative proportion of various elements of remuneration referred to above,  the grant of LTI represents approximately 40% of the Executive Officer's total annual remuneration.\n\nLTI grants to Executive Officers are subject to the proration principle on the basis of the actual presence of the Executive Officer: in the event of a departure from the Group of the Executive Officer for a reason other than resignation or removal from office for serious cause (1) , the total allocation rate (after applying the performance conditions) would be reduced pro rata for the duration of actual presence of the Executive Officer within the Group during the period of assessment of the performance criteria.\n\nIn addition, no grant of LTI will be made to the Executive Officer at the time of his departure, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code.\n\nCompany Officers are also subject to the following specific obligations :\n\n- \u25a0 Obligation to retain  shares defined by the Board of Directors pursuant to  articles L.  225-185 and L. 225-197-1  of the French Commercial Code. They lead to the obligation, for the Company Officer, to hold, in registered form, until the termination of his duties, a minimum quantity of shares corresponding to 50% of the capital gain on acquisition, net of social security charges and tax, resulting from each exercise of stock options/each definitive award of performance shares. However, this percentage will be lowered to 5%, as soon as the quantity of shares held by the Company Officer  resulting  from  the  exercise  of  stock  options  or the  definitive  award  of performance shares represents a minimum amount equal to at least three times the Company Officer's gross annual fixed remuneration. Compliance with this obligation is verified annually by the Board of Directors.\n- \u25a0 Additional shareholding obligation defined by the Board in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code: each Company Officer must also hold in a registered account a minimum number of shares based on his or her gross annual fixed remuneration (equivalent to twice his or her gross annual fixed remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board of Directors and once his or her gross annual fixed remuneration for a Senior Executive Vice President). The number of shares required to be held is assessed as of January 1 and July 1 of each year. Newly appointed Company Officers must comply within four years of their first appointment.\n- \u25a0 Lastly, the Company Officers are subject to the requirement restricting the exercise of stock options and the sale of performance shares during the 'black-out periods' prior  to the  publication  of the  financial statements and the  commitment not  to use risk hedging transactions  on  options/shares  resulting from the  exercise  of  options  and  on  performance  shares granted,  throughout  their term of office.\n- As with all beneficiaries, all the LTI granted to the Executive Officers are subject to  demanding performance  conditions calculated over a period of three years. The performance conditions, which apply to the plans decided upon in autumn, are set by the Board of Directors at the start of the year, at the February meeting, in order to comply with a reference period of three full years.\n\nFor each performance condition, a formula adopted by the Board makes it possible to determine, following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved, the percentage of performance shares definitively awarded/stock options that can be exercised.\n\nThe demanding objectives set for each performance condition are made public ex-post, at the end of the Board meeting in the month of February following the end of the three fiscal years during which the performance has to be achieved. The rate of achievement of the performance conditions and the percentage of LTI definitively awarded/that can be exercised are also published at the end of this Board meeting.\n\nFor the beneficiaries of the 'France' performance share plan, including Executive Officers, the vesting period is three years from the Board meeting which decided upon their grant. This period, at the end of which the performance shares are definitively awarded, is followed by a two-year holding period. The stock options are in principle subject to a four-year lock-up period, followed by a six-year exercise period. Added to this is a condition of presence which stipulates the loss of the stock options/rights to the performance shares in the process of being acquired, in the event of resignation or removal from office for serious cause.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board has retained for 2023, for all LTI beneficiaries (Executive Officers and employees) the ROCE, Total Shareholder Return (AL TSR and relative  TSR)  and  an  objective  related  to  the  evolution  of the  Group's carbon emissions.\n\n- \u25a0 The ROCE, which makes it possible to measure the Return on Capital Employed, is relevant in a highly capital-intensive industry.\n- \u25a0 The Total Shareholder Return (TSR) in turn makes it possible to align the Company's performance with the regular profits expected by its Shareholders.\n- \u25a0 Moreover, consistent with the Group's responsible growth approach, the LTI plans incorporate  since  2020  a  performance  condition linked to the Group's Climate Objectives.\n\n(1)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, the quantifiable and qualitative components of the variable remuneration for the Company's Executive Officer and senior executives are identical. These objectives are also reflected in those for the Company's employees who have a short-term variable remuneration. Moreover, the LTI performance conditions are identical for all the employee beneficiaries (approximately 2,000 Group employees in 2020 and 2021, approximately 2,600 Group employees in 2022) and for the Executive Officers. These alignments provide for greater coherence of efforts in achieving the Company's performance objectives. The importance given to the safety objectives helps implement a high-quality working environment for the employees that has a direct impact on their engagement and performance. The variable remuneration also incorporates objectives of talent development, the achievement of which requires in particular the  implementation  of  varied, relevant programs for the training and development of employees throughout their career, the implementation of new ways of working within the entire Group, and an objective relating to the implementation of the Group's diversity policy and, more generally, the promotion of a culture of inclusion.\n\nExecutive Officers also benefit from long-term commitments and commitments related to the termination of their duties described below, as well as other elements of annual remuneration (benefits in kind, supplementary social protection schemes) which may be terminated under ordinary law conditions.\n\n## 5.1.2.  Implementation for the determination of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration for 2023\n\nThe elements which make up the  total  remuneration  of  the  Chief Executive Officer  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  General  Meeting  of May 3, 2023, are described below.\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the remuneration policy for Executive Officers set out above, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, defined the criteria for determining, distributing and allocating the elements comprising the total remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer in line with the remuneration policy applicable to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer as approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022. These are described below.\n\nIt  is  reminded that  the positioning of the  Chief  Executive Officer's remuneration  was  drafted  based  on an  in-depth study  of  industry practices,  including  a  benchmark  of  remunerations at CAC 40  groups  with a  separated governance  mode,  with the  assistance  of  an outside firm based on publicly available data. At its meeting of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board decided to maintain for 2023 the level of remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer at the same level as for 2022, the defined remuneration presenting necessary characteristics of competitiveness and comparability.\n\nThis remuneration is attractive and takes into account Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's experience and skills, and his successful career within the Group that  he joined in  1993. His remuneration components, including long-term  commitments, also take  into account the fact that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow decided to unilaterally terminate his employment contract as of the start of his corporate mandate in June 2022, in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP/MEDEF Code and best governance practices. It also takes into account the fact that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will not receive any remuneration for his office as Director.\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Chief Executive Officer for the 2023 fiscal year is thus in line with the policy approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022, subject to a minor change concerning the methods for determining ROCE applicable to the performance condition of the Chief Executive Officer's supplementary pension plan, decided by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee. This change is detailed below (See paragraph E. below).\n\n## A.  Fixed remuneration\n\nThe fixed remuneration is determined on the basis of the level of responsibility, the experience in the executive management duties and market practices.\n\nThe annual fixed remuneration recommended for Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in 2023 is unchanged  from 2022 and, in application of the aforementioned principles, is an annual amount of 1,100,000 euros.\n\n## B.  Variable remuneration\n\nPursuant to the principles set forth above ('Structure and main characteristics common to the general remuneration of Executive Officers'), the Board of Directors of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, defined the elements of the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer for 2023 as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the quantifiable  elements of the  annual variable  remuneration include a criterion  relating  to the  increase  in the recurring net earnings (excluding exceptional and significant transactions which do not impact the operating income recurring) excluding currency impact,  per share (hereinafter 'recurring EPS') and  a criterion  relating to comparable growth in consolidated  revenue  (excluding significant scope impact and the impact of currency and energy). The weighting of each criterion is shown in the table below;\n- \u25a0 the qualitative criteria of the annual variable remuneration were defined in keeping with the continuity of qualitative objectives of the Executive Officer during the prior fiscal year. They are detailed in the table below and relate:\n- -for one-third, to CSR: Safety and reliability ; ESG objectives published by the Group on the Sustainable Development Day of March 23, 2021 (hereinafter 'ESG') and forming an integral part of the ADVANCE strategic program (press release on March 22, 2022 and available on the Company's website: https://www.airliquide.com/fr/groupe/communiques-presse-actualites/22-03-2022/air-liquidepresente-advance-son-nouveau-plan-strategique-horizon-2025-combinant-performance),\n- -for one-third, to organization and to Human Resources,",

This  criterion  responds  to  the  Board  of  Directors' desire  to  keep a  part  of  the variable remuneration subject to the Board's assessment, in order to take account of the unpredictability of the environment. This may be beneficial to the Executive Officer, if the Company is facing an unfavorable environment which was not anticipated at the time the objectives were set, or disadvantageous if the environment ultimately turns out to be more favorable than anticipated.\n\nA target weight and a maximum weight are set for each criterion.\n\nThe allocation key for the quantifiable/qualitative criteria appears in the table below. Within each category, the target and the maximum weights for each element have been rounded and reconciled with market practices as compared to the prior practice and specifically the policy  applicable  to  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  target having  been set  at  120% of  the fixed  remuneration  and  the maximum of 150% of the fixed remuneration, as detailed below:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Target  (a)                      | Target  (a)           | Maximum                          | Maximum               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Indicator                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | As a % of the fixed remuneration | As a % based on a 100 | As a % of the fixed remuneration | As a % based on a 100 |\n| Quantifiable financial criteria including:                                                                                                                                                                                  | 84                               | 70                    | 105                              | 70                    |\n| Increase in recurring net earnings  (b)  excluding the foreign exchange  impact per share (recurring EPS)                                                                                                                   | 60                               | 50                    | 75                               | 50                    |\n| Comparable growth in consolidated revenue  (c)                                                                                                                                                                              | 24                               | 20                    | 30                               | 20                    |\n| Qualitative personal criteria including:                                                                                                                                                                                    | 36                               | 30                    | 45                               | 30                    |\n| CSR :                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                  |                       |                                  |                       |\n| \u25a0 Safety and reliability: continue efforts to improve safety (lost time  accident frequency rate, road traffic accidents and job-related accidents)  \u25a0 Roll-out of the action plans relating to the Group's new sustainable |                                  |                       |                                  |                       |\n| development objectives;

Other elements of annual remuneration\n\nThe benefits in kind include the use of a company car as well as contributions to the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers. The Board of Directors decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow would, as a corporate officer and given the fact that he ended his employment contract as from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on June 1, 2022, benefit from the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers taken out by the Company. The contributions paid by the Company  are included in Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow's remuneration as benefits in kind. By way of information, these benefits amount to around 18,635 euros on an annual basis, around 13,000 euros of which is for the unemployment insurance for company managers and corporate officers.\n\n## Death and disability benefits and healthcare cost plan\n\nThe Board of Directors has decided to continue to provide Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow with the following benefits, from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and until the end of his term of office:\n\n- \u25a0 the additional 'incapacity, disability, death' benefits plan, unified as from January 1, 2015, covering all the personnel and the corporate officers duly authorized to benefit from such plan in which the remuneration taken into account for the calculation of the contributions is capped at (i) 16 times the annual social security ceiling for the incapacity and disability cover, (ii) 24 times the annual social security ceiling for the death cover;\n- \u25a0 the healthcare cost plan covering all employees.\n\nThe estimates for the 2023 fiscal year are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 employer's contribution to Healthcare Costs:\n\n396 euros;\n\n- \u25a0 employer's contribution to Death and Disability benefits:\n\n10,169 euros.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Long-term remuneration components\n\nAt its  meeting of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors provided for the allocation of performance shares to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in respect of his office as Chief Executive Officer, for the 2023 fiscal year, in an annual amount of 1,650,000 euros (based on an IFRS valuation), as in 2022.\n\nPursuant to the principles of the remuneration policy applicable to Executive Officers, the LTIs represent around 41% of the total target remuneration (fixed remuneration, target variable remuneration  and  LTI), and  the remuneration  elements subject  to  performance conditions (variable remuneration + LTI) represent approximately three quarters of the total target remuneration.\n\nThe performance conditions which apply to the Chief Executive Officer (and to all the beneficiaries of the LTI Plans which will be allocated in  2023) were determined by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023. The number of LTI that will be definitively awarded/can be exercised pursuant to the 2023 Plans will depend:\n\n- (i) for 50% of the LTI granted , on the rate of achievement of an objective, set by the Board, consisting of the recurring ROCE recorded at the end of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nAt the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award. This lower limit corresponds to  a  ROCE level which is 200 basis points less than  the  objective  set,  which  provides  a  degree  of flexibility, notably making it possible to take advantage of external growth opportunities.\n\nThe objective was set in line with the ROCE objective announced by the Company, i.e. a level maintained at more than 10% at the end of 2025;\n\n## (ii) for 40% of the LTI granted:\n\n- -for 50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on an objective of Total Shareholder Return set by the Board, defined as the average annual growth rate from an investment in Air Liquide shares, dividends reinvested, for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 fiscal years (' AL TSR ').  The  objective  of  an  absolute TSR is set in accordance with historic performances. At the objective set, the grant is 100% and then decreases on a straight-line basis to a lower limit below which there will be no award;\n- -for 50% of the LTI referred to in sub-paragraph (ii): on the rate of Total Shareholder Return from an investment in Air Liquide shares, dividends reinvested  source: Bloomberg (' B TSR '), as compared to the CAC  40 TSR index, dividends reinvested (source: Bloomberg) for the 2023, 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. The rate of achievement will be 0%, if the average of the Air Liquide TSR is lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR, 50% if it is equal to the average of the CAC 40 TSR and 100%, if it is at least higher than 2% of the average of the CAC 40 TSR on the basis of a straight-line change. Any grant for a performance lower than the average of the CAC 40 TSR is impossible;\n- (iii) for 10% of the LTI granted : change in the Group's absolute CO2 emissions over the period 2023-2025 in line with the objective for a  decline  in  2025 in  accordance with  the  Climate  Objectives  announced  by  the Group on March 23, 2021 (ACT for a sustainable future), as follows:\n\nComparison of the Air Liquide Group's CO2 emissions for the year 2025, expressed in millions of tonnes, to those same emissions for the year 2022, the 2022 basis of comparison being adjusted to take account of any possible perimeter impacts (possible takeovers of existing units at the Group's customers or companies, asset or company disposals) over the period 2023-2025, on a 12-month proforma basis, in line with the method used to monitor the Group's carbon trajectory as communicated.\n\nFor the purposes hereof, the greenhouse gas emissions include direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2). These emissions are accounted for as 'market based' (2) .\n\nThe rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded in 2026 by the Board at the time when the financial statements are approved for the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nAll of the rules and conditions applying to LTI grants to the Executive Officers described above (limits on volume and value, condition of presence, proration, shareholding and share ownership (3) and other specific regulations) apply to the allocation of performance shares in 2023 to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## E.  Long-term commitments\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  on  February  15,  2023,  on the  recommendation  of  the Remuneration  Committee, defined the  elements  of  the pension schemes from which Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow will benefit for the duration of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, in line with the remuneration policy approved in 2022. These elements, including, in particular, a supplementary pension plan, were defined by taking into account  the results of  a detailed benchmark  formed  from a panel of CAC 40 companies and European companies  with separated governance, the plan currently applicable to the Group's senior executives, the overall balance of the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer, and an effort to outline a plan ensuring competitive coverage at the best cost for the Company.\n\nAll of these elements are, as with other remuneration elements, subject to the approval of the General Meeting voting on the remuneration policy applicable to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe overall amount of the Company's contributions to the supplementary pension plans detailed below represents approximately 14.9% of the target annual Reference Remuneration (fixed remuneration + target variable remuneration), a value close to the benchmark averages.",

        "page_content": "## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Remuneration of L'Air Liquide S.A. corporate officers\n\n## Mandatory company retirement savings plan (PERO)\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow would continue to benefit from the PERO (4) (from which he had previously benefited as an employee), until the end of his term of office.\n\nThis  plan  is  financed  by monthly contributions  based  on  remuneration  not  exceeding  eight  PASS and equally distributed  between  the employer and the beneficiary. They are deductible from the corporate income tax, are subject to the social levy at the rate of 16%, and are excluded from the basis for assessment of the social security contributions, within the limit of the higher of the following two values: 5% of the PASS or 5% of the remuneration taken into account within the limit of five times the PASS.\n\nThe amount of the employer's contribution to this plan, for the 2023 fiscal year, is estimated at 10,437 euros.\n\n## 'Senior managers' defined contribution pension plan\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow would continue to benefit from the 'article 83' defined contribution pension plan, set up for the benefit of senior executives for the portion of his remuneration between 0 and 8 times the PASS until the end of his term of office.\n\nThis plan is financed by annual contributions paid in their entirety by the company on the remuneration fraction below eight PASS and are subject to the same tax and social security treatment as those paid under the PERO.\n\nThe amount of the employer's contribution to this plan for the 2023 fiscal year is estimated at 9,502 euros.\n\n## Collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription\n\nBefore his appointment as Executive Officer, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow benefited, in addition to the PERO and the defined contribution pension plan for the aforementioned senior executives, from a supplementary pension scheme applicable under certain conditions to the Group's senior  executives. As this scheme is not applicable to Company  Officers, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow no longer benefits  from it since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on June 1, 2022.\n\nIn order to replace the pension plan from which he benefited previously and to enable Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow to benefit from a supplementary pension plan in his capacity as Company Officer, the Board of Directors having decided that, from his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and until the end of his term of office, Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow would benefit from a collective pension insurance contract with individual and optional subscription (known as 'article 82 of the French General Tax Code') for the fraction of his Reference Remuneration [Fixed remuneration + Target variable remuneration] exceeding 8 PASS. The amount paid by the Company is split between a payment to the insurer and a payment to Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow intended to partially cover the social security contributions and taxes due on the payments made to the insurer. This amount is paid in arrears every  year  for  the  period  until  the  end  of  the  executive  office,  after  recording  the performance conditions associated with this pension plan.\n\nMr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow cannot apply for the entitlements under this pension insurance contract before the age at which he becomes entitled to claim his pension entitlements under the French general social security scheme.\n\nApplication of this mechanism to the Chief Executive Officer was determined taking into account the overall balance of his remuneration and the market conditions, and for the Company represents, for the same efficiency for the beneficiary, a 31% lower cost to the Company than that which would result from implementing a new supplementary pension plan with defined vested benefits under article L. 137-11-2 of the French Social Security Code.\n\nThis supplementary pension plan for the fraction of remuneration exceeding 8 PASS is entirely subject to performance conditions. The gross annual amount of payments totals approximately 345,000 euros, subject to the achievement of the performance conditions described below.\n\nThus, the total amount of contributions for a fiscal year will depend on the average annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE), determined as set out below, and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (net equity method), calculated (on the basis of the certified Consolidated financial statements, approved by the General Meeting) for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured for each fiscal year and the average of the three annual gaps will be calculated for the last three fiscal years prior to the said fiscal year.\n\nIn order not to penalize the calculation in the event of a major transaction, the Board of Directors, at its meeting of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the  Remuneration  Committee, decided that the  ROCE used  would  be the  recurring ROCE 'excluding  major acquisitions'. Acquisitions representing more than 5% of capital employed are considered to be major for the purposes of this definition.

Commitments relating to termination of duties\n\n## Termination indemnities\n\nThe Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, decided that Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow (who unilaterally ended his employment contract as of his appointment as Chief Executive Officer with effect from June 1, 2022) would continue to benefit from a termination indemnity, subject to very strict triggering conditions. The main terms are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 only  the  cases  of  forced  departure  of  Mr Fran\u00e7ois  Jackow  from  his term  of office as  Chief  Executive  Officer  (removal  from  office, request for resignation) related to a change of strategy or a change in control (in the latter case, the termination indemnity is due, if the departure occurs within six months of the change of control) may give rise to an indemnity;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity in any of these cases is set at the 24 previous months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration actually paid (24 months of fixed remuneration + 2 previous annual variable remunerations actually paid) on the date of termination of his  duties (subject  to the exceptions described below and in the paragraph relating to the non-competition  commitment).  As an exception to this rule, in the event of departure during the course of the 2023 or 2024 fiscal years, for the calculation of the indemnity of 24 months of fixed and variable remuneration, the following will be taken into account: for the variable remuneration, the target variable remuneration awarded in the absence of variable remuneration paid in respect of a fiscal year (for each fiscal year concerned); and the annual fixed remuneration of the ongoing fiscal year and that of the previous fiscal year;\n- \u25a0 the amount of the indemnity due decreases gradually as Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, approaches the age limit defined in the Company's articles of association; in the event of a forced departure in the 24 months preceding the date of departure due to the age limit  set  by  the  articles  of association, the amount of the indemnity due will be capped at the number of months' gross remuneration separating the date of forced departure from the date when he reaches such age limit; in any event, no indemnity shall be paid should the beneficiary claim his pension entitlements on the date of his forced departure;\n- \u25a0 the right to payment of the indemnity is subject to the achievement of the performance conditions, the proportion of the indemnity due decreasing depending on the rate of achievement of such conditions (see below for details of the performance conditions).\n\n## Performance conditions applicable to the termination indemnity\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that the payment of the termination indemnity concerning Mr Fran\u00e7ois Jackow is subject to compliance, duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors at the time of or subsequent to the termination of his duties, with conditions related to the beneficiary's performance assessed in light of the Company's performance (unchanged compared to the conditions included in the policy approved in May 2022), defined as of today as follows:\n\nEntitlement to the indemnity referred to above shall depend on, and the amount of the indemnity paid will be adjusted on the basis of, the average of the annual gap between the Return on Capital Employed after tax (ROCE) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (assessed  using  the net  equity method),  calculated (on the  basis of the  certified  Consolidated  financial  statements,  approved  by  the General Meeting) with respect to the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which the departure occurs. For the purposes of this calculation, the gap between the ROCE and the WACC will be measured with regard to each fiscal year, and the average of the three annual gaps for the last three fiscal years prior to the fiscal year during which such departure takes place will be calculated.\n\nThe proportion of the indemnity due will be established as indicated in the table below, with an increase in the indemnity by straight-line segments between each of the thresholds between 100 bps and 300 bps inclusive:\n\n(a)\n\n| Average of the annual gaps (ROCE - WACC) over three years in bps   | Proportion of indemnity due   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| \u2265 300                                                              | 100%                          |\n| 250                                                                | 66%                           |\n| 200                                                                | 50%                           |\n| 100                                                                | 25%                           |\n| < 100                                                              | 0%                            |\n\n(a) bps: basis points.\n\n## Indemnity relating to a non-competition commitment\n\nTo safeguard the legitimate interests of the Company, the Board of Directors decided to grant a non-competition indemnity in consideration of the commitment that would be made by the Chief Executive Officer not to directly or indirectly serve a business competing with that of the Group, for a term of two years as from the date on which he ends his term of office.\n\nThe amount of this indemnity, payable monthly, would be equal to one year of gross annual fixed and variable remuneration received by the Chief Executive Officer (excluding sums received in respect of long-term variable remuneration), wherein the aggregated termination indemnity and non-competition indemnity are capped at 24 months of annual gross fixed and variable remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer on the date on which he ends his term of office.\n\nPayment of the non-competition indemnity shall not apply from the moment the Chief Executive Officer exercises his pension entitlements. In any event, no indemnity shall be paid beyond age 65.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  reserves  the right  to  fully  or  partially waive  the  non-competition  commitment  upon  the departure  of  the Chief Executive Officer, in which case no indemnity will be owed.",

Remuneration principles and structure\n\nThis remuneration policy for the  Chairman of the  Board of Directors is  unchanged from  that  approved by the General Meeting on May 4, 2022.\n\nThus, in accordance with the recommendation of the AFEP/MEDEF Code (article 26.2), the Chairman is only awarded fixed remuneration, to the exclusion of any variable remuneration, LTI or exceptional remuneration.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, the Chairman may receive remuneration as a Director (section 5.2 'Remuneration policy applicable to Directors'). Nevertheless, in the case of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, it has been decided that he will not receive any remuneration as a Director.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors has all of the material means to fulfill his mission.\n\nDepending  on the circumstances,  the Chairman may be authorized  to  benefit  from  the  death  and disability  benefits  plan  covering  all personnel in addition to corporate officers authorized to benefit therefrom.\n\n## B.  2023 Remuneration of the Chairman of the Board\n\nIn  accordance with the principles set out above, the Board of Directors' meeting of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, defined the components of remuneration applicable to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier, unchanged from those defined in 2022.\n\nThe positioning of  the remuneration had been drafted based on an in-depth study  of industry practices, including  a benchmark  of remunerations of board chairs at a representative  panel  of companies with a separated governance mode within  the CAC  40, and European companies (5) , with the assistance of an outside firm. It takes into account the specific role of the Chairman of the Board in the particular  context  of  managerial succession and the missions that the Board of Directors wished to entrust to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier for the duration of the transition in order to benefit from his experience, in-depth knowledge of the Group and its businesses, its Shareholders and stakeholders and its strategic challenges - see chapter 3, section 2.1.2, paragraph 'Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors '.\n\nIn this context, the amount of the annual fixed remuneration of Mr Beno\u00eet Potier has been set at 800,000 euros, excluding any variable and long-term remuneration (notably LTI) and any exceptional remuneration. Mr Beno\u00eet Potier will not receive any additional remuneration in his capacity as a Director.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Beno\u00eet Potier will benefit from the use of a company car, representing benefits in kind which amount to around 2,782 euros per year.\n\nIn  line  with  2022,  Mr  Beno\u00eet Potier continues to benefit from the death and disability benefits plans (death insurance only) covering all employees as well as corporate officers duly authorized to benefit from them.\n\nThe amount of the 2023 contribution to this plan is estimated at 10,169 euros.\n\n## 5.2. REMUNERATION POLICY APPLICABLE TO DIRECTORS\n\nThe  remuneration policy applicable to Directors was  determined  by  the Board  of Directors  on February 15,  2023  on the basis  of a recommendation from the  Remuneration  Committee. The decision-making  process  followed  to  determine  the policy  is  also  applicable when said policy is reviewed and implemented.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to Directors is submitted to the vote of the General Meeting, in line with its principles and structure, in accordance with the policy decided by the Board of Directors in February 2022 and approved by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022.\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Directors aims to determine, pursuant to the total package voted by the Ordinary General Meeting (to date, a maximum annual pay package of 1.3 million euros, in accordance with the 12 th resolution voted by the Combined General Meeting on May 5, 2020), a remuneration which is competitive internationally to attract the best skills and expertise, in compliance with the Board's diversity policy.\n\nFirst of all, it provides for fixed remuneration (prorated if the term of office commences or comes to an end during the course of the year) allocated to the Directors. This remuneration is increased for the Lead Director, and an additional fixed remuneration is allocated to the Chairs of the four Board Committees, to take account of the level of responsibilities incurred and the work involved as a result of these duties.\n\nIt also includes a variable remuneration, which is the highest part, on the basis of each Director's attendance at the meetings of the Board and the Committees/working group, in accordance with the AFEP/MEDEF Code, in the form of the allocation of a fixed amount for each attendance at a meeting.\n\nPursuant  to the  policy  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of  May  4,  2022,  (i)  the fixed remuneration  allocated  to  Committee  Chairs  is harmonized, as their  functions  involve  significantly comparable  responsibilities,  likewise  the  amount  of  the remuneration  allocated  for attending each Committee meeting and (ii) remote attendance of meetings is remunerated in the same way as attending in person in order to take into account the quality of means of communication allowing members connecting via video-conference to attend meetings and take part in discussions under conditions that are equivalent to them being physically present at meetings. While it does not alter  the preference of the  Board  and  its  members  to  attend  meetings  in  person  where  possible,  it  recognizes  the  advances  in  communication technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board of Directors of February 2023, decided to readjust on recommendation of the Remuneration Committee this amount related to intercontinental travel has been readjusted in 2023 to take into account market trends and maintain the competitiveness of the remuneration of foreign Directors. Travel expenses are refunded by the Company.\n\nThis  policy promotes attendance  and  effective participation  by  the  Directors  in  the work of the  Board  and  Committees,  which  fosters dialogue between the Directors and with the management team, and, more generally, a complete understanding by the members of the Company's activities  and issues, including  any social  and environmental issues, which  ensures solid  governance for the  Company's sustainability.\n\nThe recognition of the role of the Lead Director, who receives additional remuneration in this regard, reflects the importance accorded by the Group to his governance tasks, in connection with the meetings of the Board and the Appointments and Governance Committee, and in an informal manner between such meetings, thus promoting best governance practices. For this reason, the Company has decided, as indicated in the section 'Governance - composition, functioning and work of the Board of Directors and Committees' (paragraph 3), to maintain the function of the Lead Director the same under a separated governance mode. The consideration, in the remuneration policy, of the work of the four specialist Committees is evidence of the importance accorded to the preparation of the principal Board decisions, whether in terms of the proper running of the governing bodies, the review of the financial statements and the financial situation, the risk analysis, the consideration of the societal and environmental issues across all the Group's activities or indeed the determination of an incentivizing remuneration policy for the Executive Officers, including objectives in line with those of the Company.\n\nAccordingly, the remuneration policy, which is balanced and incentivizing, contributes to the quality of the Board's work, the latter being thus able to determine the orientations of the Company's activity and its strategy in the best interests of the Company, its employees and all the stakeholders.\n\nIt is stated that the Company Officers do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director or as Chair of a Committee/working group while they perform executive duties at L'Air Liquide S.A. Moreover, pursuant to the provisions in force at the Group which apply to all the employees who perform duties on the Group companies' Boards of Directors, and in agreement with the various stakeholders, the employee Directors do not receive remuneration in respect of their office as Director.

Attribution policy\n\nThe Company attributes annually, in principle, performance shares and/or stock options (hereinafter referred to as 'LTI') in favor of its Executive Officers and its employees. Performance share plans for its employees have been in place since 2008, and have been open to the Executive Officers and the members of the Executive Committee since 2015.\n\nThese attributions are decided upon by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations granted by the General Meeting, and most recently by the Combined General Meeting of May 4, 2022 for a period of 38 months.\n\nSince 2019, the Board of Directors has decided, in accordance with the general market trend, to grant performance shares only (instead of a mix of stock options and performance shares) to all beneficiaries, in order to simplify and standardize the scheme.\n\nThe system for the LTI plans is aimed at three sets of beneficiaries:\n\n- \u25a0 the Company's Executive Officer, for whom the attribution of LTI and its evolution over time continue to be valued in terms of the IFRS valuation (and not as attributed volumes), all stock option and performance share plans included;\n- \u25a0 the members of the Executive Committee and the Group's managers who hold positions with a high level of responsibility or who make special contributions to the Group, all of whom benefit, beginning in 2015 for the Executive Committee and since 2019/2020 for the other beneficiaries, from attribution exclusively in the form of performance shares;\n- \u25a0 the specific contributors, such as those employees distinguished by the quality of their conduct in exceptional situations, the inventors and innovators, the middle managers, as well as an expanded category of new employee beneficiaries.\n\nThe criteria used to draw up the lists of the beneficiary employees reflect the jobs and the geographical areas in which the Group carries out its activities and the specific contribution, the particular potential, or the individual or collective conduct of the persons concerned, which has been noted in exceptional situations. The lists of beneficiary employees are also drawn up with the desire to ensure a certain rotation and an expansion of the beneficiary population. Accordingly, around one-third of the beneficiaries of the plans dated September 29, 2022 are employees who had not been awarded stock options/performance shares during the last five years.\n\n## ATTRIBUTIONS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2022\n\n| Total number of performance shares   | 460,415   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|\n| % of the share capital               | 0.09%     |\n| Number of grants  (a)                | 2,635     |\n| % of employees                       | 3.91%     |\n\nPerformance conditions apply to all the performance shares which are awarded to all the beneficiaries. They are described on pages 196 to 197.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the aggregate total of outstanding performance shares for which the definitive grant date has not yet occurred and the outstanding stock options has not yet been exercised corresponds to the number of shares representing 0.52% of the share capital on this date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The maximum exercise period is 10 years since the stock option plan dated October 14, 2011.\n\nThe stock options cannot be exercised before a minimum period of four years after they are awarded. The Board of Directors has the power to terminate this lock-in period if there is a takeover bid for the Company's shares or a merger or takeover of the Company.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the number of outstanding share options granted by the Board of Directors under the plans approved by Annual General Meetings amounted to 1,340,889 options after adjustment (average price of 72.38 euros), or 0.26% of share capital.\n\nOf the total stock options authorized for issue by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 there was still a potential attribution of 10,469,005 stock options as at December 31, 2022 (no stock options were attributed since 2019, as the Board of Directors decided to only attribute performance shares).\n\nTABLE 8.

Performance share plans (information to be regarded as the special Report of the Board of Directors within the meaning of article L. 225-197-4 of the French Commercial Code)\n\n## 3.1. DESCRIPTION\n\nSince 2008, performance share attributions have been designed to retain and motivate talented employees dynamically and to reward performance over the medium term.\n\nThe Extraordinary General Meeting of May 4,  2022  authorized  the  Board  to attribute  performance  shares  to the  Group's  employees, within an upper attribution limit equal to 0.5% of the share capital over 38 months; pursuant to this upper limit, it fixed the limit on the number of shares that can be attributed to the Executive Officers over the same period, which amounts to 0.1% of the share capital.\n\nFor each attribution, the  Board  determines  two different  plan  regulations (the 'France'  Plan  and  the  'World'  Plan) which  govern  the attribution of performance shares to the beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly differ in the number of years of presence required, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan as described below.\n\nThe performance shares are accompanied by:\n\n- \u25a0 a continued service requirement during the vesting period: the shares granted to a beneficiary shall only finally vest if he or she has been an employee or corporate officer of a Group company during a vesting period, calculated as from the grant date, of three years for  'France'  Plan beneficiaries and four years for 'World' Plan beneficiaries. In the event of retirement, the beneficiary retains his rights, being no longer required to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n- \u25a0 performance conditions which relate, since the first attribution in 2008, to all performance shares awarded to any beneficiary; see the performance conditions in the summary table for attribution of performance shares below;\n- \u25a0 a holding obligation: with effect from the definitive attribution date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan have an obligation to hold the shares for an additional two years during which the said shares cannot be transferred (other than in the event of a death or disability).\n\nTo date, the performance shares delivered have been treasury shares issued as part of the Company's buyback program (see page 446).\n\nThe outstanding performance shares attributed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the authorizations voted by the General Meetings, for  which  the  definitive attribution  has  not  yet  occurred,  amounted,  after  adjustment, to 1,347,690  shares  as at  December 31,  2022, i.e. 0.26% of the shares that make up the share capital.\n\nOut of the total performance shares whose award was authorized by the General Meeting of May 4, 2022 for 38 months, 2,156,836 performance shares remained potentially available for award as at December 31, 2022.",

PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS DATED SEPTEMBER 29, 2022\n\nPursuant to the authorization of the Combined General Meeting of May 4, 2022, in connection with the 'France' and 'World' Plans dated September 29, 2022, the Board of Directors made a conditional allocation of a total of 460,415 shares representing 0.09% of the share capital in terms of the number of shares to 2,575 distinct beneficiaries (181,480 shares allocated to the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan and 278,935 shares allocated to the beneficiaries of the 'World' Plan).\n\nThe IFRS individual fair value for these performance shares amounts to 98.26 euros for the 'France' Plan and to 94.72 euros for the 'World' Plan - see details of this IFRS value in Note 21.5 'Share-based payments' in the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nSubject  to the satisfaction of the presence and performance conditions,  these  shares will be  fully vested for  the beneficiaries on September 29, 2025 for the 'France' Plan (but cannot be sold until September 29, 2027) and on September 29, 2026 for the 'World' Plan.\n\nFor this award, the Board adopted performance conditions calculated over three fiscal years - for a full description, see pages 196 et 197.\n\nThe rate of achievement of the performance conditions will be recorded by the Board of Directors at its meeting to approve the financial statements for the 2024 fiscal year.\n\nThe Board decided to apply to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier the principle of proration on termination of his office as Chief Executive Officer on May 31, 2022, even if he maintains the position of non-executive officer within the Group. The performance shares attributed to Mr Beno\u00eet Potier in 2020 and 2021 will therefore be prorated - for more details see page 186.\n\nSEPTEMBER 29, 2022 PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN - DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF BENEFICIARIES\n\n|                                                                                                             | Number of  beneficiaries   | Number of shares   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|\n| Executive officers of L'Air Liquide S.A.                                                                    | 1                          | 9,790              |\n| Senior executives (who are not corporate officers of L'Air Liquide S.A.), managers and special contributors | 127                        | 175,660            |\n| Other employees, new beneficiaries                                                                          | 2,447                      | 274,965            |",

Profit-sharing\n\nProfit-sharing and incentive schemes have been organized for many years in Group companies in France and paid almost 60.0 million euros for 2021 performance. This year these schemes cover over 98% of employees.\n\nUnder the main Company Savings Plans, Group employees in France can make payments to dedicated and diversified investment funds, on a voluntary basis or based on profit-sharing, incentives and, where applicable, contributions, and thus benefit from the preferential tax regime applicable in consideration for locking-in their assets over a period of five years.\n\nIn 2022, L'Air Liquide S.A. distributed 8.6  million  euros gross (excluding  Company contributions)  in  respect of  profit-sharing and incentives. Some 1,252 employees benefited from these schemes. Company contributions to the Company Savings Plan are negotiated every year and amounted to nearly 1.26 million euros gross in 2022. These payments correspond to an average amount of 6,887 euros per employee excluding Company contribution.\n\nSince 2021, the employees of L'Air Liquide S.A. may invest their incentive and profit-sharing (excluding Company contributions) in the Air Liquide Supplementary Retirement Savings Plan. In 2022, 440 thousand euros were invested in this plan.\n\nIn 2022, L'Air Liquide S.A.  employees invested  90.3% of their profit-sharing and incentives  in  savings  plans, respectively in bondweighted assets (27%) and equity-weighted assets (27%).\n\nA total of 46% of employee savings was invested in corporate mutual fund holding only Air Liquide shares compared with 31% last year.\n\n## 2. Employee share ownership\n\nThe Group is keen  to involve its  employees in its development. These employee share ownership  offers  contribute  significantly  to increasing employee motivation and a sense of belonging to the Group.\n\nSince  1986,  the Company has regularly  performed  share  capital  increases  reserved  for Group employees,  for which  subscription  is offered at a preferential rate. The most recent capital increase, conducted in November 2021, resulted in the subscription of 1,098,738 shares by 22,420 Group employees, representing 33.81% of the eligible employees in 74 countries.\n\nIn France, the shares subscribed in these capital increases are also eligible for the preferential tax regime applicable provided that they are blocked over a period of five years, while those held abroad are governed by the legal regulations prevailing in each relevant country.\n\nAt the  end of  2022,  the share  of capital held  by  Group employees  and former  employees was  estimated at  2.8%, of  which 2.0% corresponded (within the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-102  of  the French  Commercial  Code)  to  shares  subscribed  by employees under employee-reserved capital increases or held through mutual funds. The percentage of Group employees holding L'Air Liquide S.A. shares totaled around 46% of the workforce.\n\nAir  Liquide  wishes  to  pursue  this  strategy  and  further  the development of its  employee  share  ownership,  by regularly  offering  share capital increases to employees.",

The IFRS standards and interpretations as adopted by the European Union are available at the following website:\n\nhttps://ec.europa.eu/info/law/international-accounting-standardsregulation-ec-no-1606-2002/amending-and-supplementary-acts/ acts-adopted-basis-regulatory-procedure-scrutiny-rps\\_en\n\nThe Group has not anticipated any new standards, amendments to existing standards or new interpretations published by the IASB but not yet approved or not yet mandatory in the European Union, as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Financial Statements are presented in millions of euros. They were approved by the Board of Directors on February 15, 2023. They will be submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting on May 3, 2023.\n\n## NEW IFRS AND INTERPRETATIONS\n\n- 1. Standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union whose application is mandatory as of January 1, 2022\n\nThe following texts have no significant impact for the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments  to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', to IAS  16 'Property, Plant and Equipment', to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent  Liabilities  and Contingent Assets' and the  annual improvements 2018-2020, issued on May 14, 2020.\n- 2. Standards, interpretations and amendments endorses by the European Union whose application is optional in 2022\n\nThe Group Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 do not include any potential impacts from the standards, interpretations and amendments endorsed by the European Union as of December 31, 2022, for which adoption is only mandatory as of fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2022. These texts are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction', issued on May 7, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements', issued on February 12, 2021;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates', issued on February 12, 2021.\n\nThe Group did not apply the amendment to IFRS 16 'Covid-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021', issued on March 31, 2021 and of which the implementation is optional.\n\nFinally, the following texts are not applicable to the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts', issued on May 18, 2017;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IFRS 17 'First application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 -Comparative Information' issued on December 9, 2021.\n\n## 3. Standards, interpretations and amendments not yet endorses by the European Union\n\nThe impacts on the Financial Statements of texts published by the IASB as of December 31, 2022 and not yet endorsed by the European Union are currently being analyzed. These texts are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current', 'Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current -Deferral of Effective Date' and 'Non-current Liabilities with Covenants',  issued  on  January  23, 2020,  July 15,  2020 and October 31, 2022 respectively;\n- \u25a0 amendments to IFRS 16 'Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback' issued on September 22, 2022.\n\n## USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nThe preparation of  the Financial Statements  requires  Group or subsidiary management to make estimates and use certain assumptions which have a significant impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the notes related to these assets and liabilities, the profit and expense items in the income statement and the commitments  relating to the  period-end.  Balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement line items could differ should the subsequent actual results differ from the estimates. The most significant estimates and assumptions concern namely:\n\n- \u25a0 the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and amortization: these estimates are described in section 5.e of the accounting policies;\n- \u25a0 the  assumptions used to determine  provisions  for employee retirement benefit obligations: the actuarial assumptions used (employee turnover, mortality, retirement age, salary increase, etc.), and the  discount  rates  used  to determine the present value of obligations, as described in section 11.b of the accounting policies and in note 23.3;\n- \u25a0 the estimates and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests,  as  described in  section 5.f.  of the  accounting policies and in note 10.2;\n- \u25a0 the methods used to recover deferred tax assets on the balance sheet;\n- \u25a0 the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses;\n- \u25a0 the  accounting  methods  for  the  margin  of  the Engineering & Construction  contracts that  are  set  out in section  3.b of the accounting policies.\n- \u25a0 the assumptions retained to evaluate the lease liability (IFRS 16): lease term and discount rate. They are described in section 5.g of the accounting principles.\n\nIn addition,  the Group  considers  that  climate risks  are  material, even though their quantified impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of the  Group is  not material.  The  Group takes  into account  these  risks  in  its  closing  assumptions  and  incorporates their potential impact in its Financial Statements. In particular, climate risks are  taken  into account when carrying out  closing procedures, in particular the analysis of the useful lives of property, plant and equipment used for calculation of depreciation and  amortization, the  review  of the  estimates  and assumptions concerning assets' impairment tests, and the risk assessment to determine the amount of provisions for contingencies and losses. The  consideration  of  climate  risks  by the  Group  is  described in particular in note 31.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The carrying amount of other assets and liabilities hedged against fair value risk is adjusted to take into account  the changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risks. In addition, the principles of fairness, going concern, and consistency were applied.\n\n## 1. CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nThe consolidation methods used are:\n\n- \u25a0 full consolidation method for subsidiaries;\n- \u25a0 assets, liabilities, expenses and revenue of joint operations are recognized in relation to the Group's interest in these entities;\n- \u25a0 equity method for joint ventures and associates.\n\n## a.  Subsidiaries\n\nAll the subsidiaries or companies in which the Air Liquide Group exercises  exclusive  control  are fully  consolidated.  Control exists when all the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities;\n- \u25a0 the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity;\n- \u25a0 the  Group  has  the  ability  to  use  its  power  over  the  entity  so that it affects the amount of the returns.\n\nCompanies are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and until the date on which control is transferred outside the Group.\n\n## b.  Joint operations\n\nJoint  operations  are  joint  arrangements  whereby  the Air Liquide Group has joint control with one or several parties through a contractual agreement, which gives it rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the entity.\n\nAssets,  liabilities, expenses  and  revenue of joint operations  are recognized in relation to the Group's interest in these entities. These amounts are recorded on each relevant line of the Financial Statements as for the consolidated entities.\n\n## c. Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the Air Liquide Group has joint control with one or several parties through a contractual agreement, which gives it rights to the net assets of the entity.\n\nJoint  ventures are  consolidated  using  the equity  method.  Under this one, the net assets and net profit of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in a joint venture, goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\n## d.  Associates\n\nAssociates are investments over which the Air Liquide Group has significant influence (generally when the Group has more than a 20% interest), but no control.\n\nAssociates are consolidated using the equity method. Under this one, the net assets and net profit of a company are recognized pro rata to the interest held by the Group in the share capital.\n\nOn acquisition of an investment in an associate, the goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are prepared as of December 31.\n\n## e. Inter-company transactions\n\nAll inter-company receivables and payables, income and expenses and profits or losses are eliminated.\n\n## 2. TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF COMPANIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE EURO\n\nThe functional currency of an entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which it carries out its operations. In the majority of cases, the functional currency corresponds to the local currency. However, a functional currency other than the local currency can be retained for certain entities, provided that it represents the  currency of the  main  transactions  carried  out by the entity and that it ensures faithful representation of its economic environment.\n\nThe presentation currency of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements is  the  euro. At  the  balance  sheet  date,  the  financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 balance sheet items, at the official year-end exchange rates;\n- \u25a0 income statement and  cash flow  statement items, using the average exchange rate over the period for each currency.\n\nExchange differences are recognized under a separate item 'Translation  reserves'  in  gains  and  losses  recognized  directly  in equity.\n\nCumulative foreign exchange gains and losses as of January 1, 2004 arising from the translation into euros of the financial statements  of  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currency  is  not the euro have been maintained as a separate component of equity.\n\nOn removal from the scope of consolidation, the cumulative exchange differences of a company whose functional currency is not the euro are recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 3. REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nThe analysis of revenue recognition is based on the Group's activities, as follow:\n\n## a.  Gas & Services\n\nThe supply of gas involves local production in order to limit transport costs.  Therefore,  Air Liquide gas production  units  are located throughout the world and can supply several types of customers and industries, with the relevant volumes and services required:",

        "page_content": "## Large Industries\n\nThis business is characterized by the supply of large quantities of gas  contracted  for a  period  of  15  years  or  longer  with  a  limited number of customers. The Group guarantees a high level of reliability and availability of gas supply with continued service, over the long-term. In return, these contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through firm purchase clauses (take-or-pay). Due to the volume of gas to be supplied, Air Liquide supplies its Large Industries customers directly by pipelines, from a dedicated plant or different plants connected by a network.\n\nThese plants represent significant investments that are generally made in a way to share the production assets with the other business lines  of  the  Group, particularly  the  Industrial  Merchant business, or intended to serve the customers in an industrial basin that is connected on a pipeline network. In these cases, the assets are not identified under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases' and no lease contract is contained in the contracts with customers. When the customer's gas supply comes from a dedicated plant, the Group may decide on the use of these plants under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases'. Consequently, the gas supply contracts for the Large Industries business do not contain leases.\n\nCustomers of the Large Industries business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As a result, the revenue recognition related to these contracts occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\n## Industrial Merchant, Healthcare and Electronics\n\nThe Industrial Merchant business relies mainly on the gas production capacity of Large Industries and thereafter develops its own distribution logistics. This business is characterized by a wide range of customers and markets. The contract terms can be up to five years for cylinders and liquid gas supply and up to 15 years for small on-site gas generators.\n\nHealthcare business  supplies  medical  gases, hygiene products, services as well as medical devices to hospitals and patients in their homes. It also produces and distributes healthcare specialty ingredients for the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and vaccine markets.\n\nThe Electronics business  supplies its  customers with (i) carrier gases with  a  business  model  based on long-term contracts and on guaranteed minimum volumes with take-or-pay type clauses, (ii) electronics specialty materials in  the form  of pure or mixed gases,  (iii)  advanced materials,  (iv) equipment  and installations and (v) services notably on-site quality control and fluid management services.\n\nFor  safety and quality  reasons, Air  Liquide  supplies  gas with  its own equipment (small generators, storage tank, cylinders). Customers have no right of control on the identified assets under the meaning of IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nConsequently, the gas supply contracts for these businesses do not contain leases and the revenue recognition occurs as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 gas supply:  the  revenue  recognition occurs  when the  gas  is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available;\n- \u25a0 sale of standard equipment and materials: the revenue recognition  occurs  when  the  control  of  these equipment and materials  is  transferred, which  generally takes  place  at their delivery;\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and installations: the transfer of control occurs over the time, together with their construction. Consequently, the revenue recognition occurs  based  on the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date;\n- \u25a0 service:  the revenue recognition occurs when the service is provided.\n\n## b.  Engineering & Construction\n\nAir Liquide  enters into contracts  to  design and  build  production units  worldwide for  the  Group's  own  account and  for third-party customers.\n\nThe control of installations  is  transferred  progressively  with their design/construction. Consequently, the revenue recognition is based on the stage of completion of the contracts at the balance sheet date. The costs associated are recognized as an expense in the period when incurred. The stage of completion is assessed by using the ratio of contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date versus total estimated contract costs.\n\nThe margin realized at the stage of completion is recognized only when it can be reliably measured. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue,  the expected loss is immediately recognized as a provision for onerous contracts.\n\n## c. Global Markets & Technologies\n\nThe Global Markets & Technologies business focuses on new markets requiring a global approach.  This business is  growing mainly within the following markets:\n\n- \u25a0 new markets relating to the energy transition, as well as space, aerospace, and extreme cryogenics markets. As a consequence of its nature, the analysis of the revenue recognition on  this market is done on  a  case-by-case  basis depending on the nature of performance obligations;\n- \u25a0 gas usages by the actors in the maritime sector, namely offshore oil and gas platforms, offshore wind turbines, or cryogenic transportation by  sea.  The  analysis  carried  out for Industrial Merchant is applicable to this market.\n\n## 4. TAXES\n\n## a.  Income tax expense\n\nThe  tax  rate  is calculated  on the  basis of the  fiscal regulations enacted or substantively enacted at the fiscal year closing date in each of the countries where the Group's companies carry out their business.\n\nThe Group's applicable tax rate corresponds to the average of the theoretical  tax  rates  in force in  each of the  countries, weighted according to profit obtained in each of these countries.\n\nThe  average  effective tax rate is calculated  as  follows: (current and deferred income tax expense)/(net profit before tax less share of profit of equity affiliates, dividends received and net profit from discontinued operations).\n\n## b.  Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax base (excluding non-deductible goodwill and the other exceptions provided in IAS 12), the tax loss carryforwards and the unused tax credits. Deferred tax assets are recognized on all deductible temporary differences provided that it is highly probable that the tax benefits will be realized in future years.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The liability method is applied and any changes to the tax rates are recognized in the income statement, except those related to items directly  recognized in equity.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the entities have a legally enforceable right to offset and if they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority. Deferred taxes are not discounted.\n\nDeferred taxes are mainly due to temporary differences between the tax and economic depreciation of assets, the carryforward of tax losses and provisions not immediately deductible for tax purposes, such as employee benefit provisions.\n\nWhen the Group decides not to distribute profits retained by the subsidiary within the foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability is recognized.\n\n## 5. NON-CURRENT ASSETS\n\n## a.  Goodwill and business combinations\n\n## Business combinations as of January 1, 2010\n\nThe Group has prospectively applied IFRS 3 revised and IAS 27 revised since January 1, 2010.\n\nWhen the Group obtains control of an acquiree, the business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method on the acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3 revised:\n\n- \u25a0 the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 any minority interests in an acquiree are measured as the minority interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiable assets or at fair value. This option is applied on a case-by-case basis;\n- \u25a0 the consideration transferred and any contingent consideration are measured at fair value;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related costs are recorded as other operating expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.\n\nFor a business  combination achieved in stages,  any previously held equity interests in the acquiree are measured at the acquisition-date fair value. Any resulting gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe measurement period of a business combination shall not exceed  12  months  as  of  the acquisition  date. Any  adjustments, after the measurement period, of the consideration transferred and the fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities are recorded in the income statement.\n\nOn the acquisition date, goodwill is recognized in the consolidated balance sheet as the difference between:\n\n- \u25a0 the consideration transferred plus the amount of minority interests in  the acquiree  and  the fair  value  of  the previously held equity interest; and,\n- \u25a0 the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.\n\nNegative goodwill is recognized immediately through profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of cash-generating  units  that  benefit  from  business combination synergies.  Subsequently, goodwill  is  not amortized  but  is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are any indications of impairment, in accordance with the method described in section 5.f.\n\n## Business combinations prior to January 1, 2010\n\nBusiness combinations  achieved  prior  to  January 1, 2010 have been accounted for in accordance with the former versions of IFRS 3 and IAS 27.  These  standards  had already  adopted the acquisition method in the version published by the IASB in March 2004. The main provisions that differed from the revised standards are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 minority interests were measured based on their share of the net identifiable assets of the acquiree and the fair value measurement option did not exist;\n- \u25a0 earn-outs  were included  in  the  acquisition cost, without  time limits, when the payment was deemed probable and the amount could be reliably measured;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related costs were recorded in the cost of the business combination.\n\nFor an acquisition achieved in stages, the fair value remeasurement of any previously held net asset was recognized in equity.\n\nFor an acquisition of minority interests in a previously held company, the difference between the acquisition cost and the net carrying amount of the minority interests was recorded in goodwill.\n\nAt the time of the transition to IFRS and in accordance with the exemption  offered by IFRS 1, the Group  decided not to apply IFRS 3  'Business combinations' retrospectively for acquisitions that took place prior to January 1, 2004.\n\n## b.  Research and Development expenditures\n\nResearch and Development expenditures include all costs related to the scientific  and  technical activities, patent  work, education and training necessary to ensure the development, manufacturing, start-up, and commercialization of new or improved products or processes.\n\nAccording to  IAS  38, development  costs shall be  capitalized if, and only if, the Group can meet all of the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are itemized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the technical and industrial feasibility of completing the project is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset arising from it;\n- \u25a0 the  Group has the  ability  to  use or  sell the  intangible  asset arising from the project;\n- \u25a0 the Group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;\n- \u25a0 the Group has adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the project and to use or sell the intangible asset.\n\nWhen these conditions are not satisfied, development costs generated by the Group are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\nResearch expenditure is recognized as an expense when incurred.",

        "page_content": "## c. Internally generated intangible assets\n\nInternally generated intangible assets primarily include the development costs of information  management systems.  These costs are capitalized only if they satisfy the criteria as defined by IAS 38 and described above.\n\nInternal and external development costs on management information systems arising from the development phase are capitalized.  Significant  maintenance and  improvement costs  are added to the  initial cost  of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nInternally generated intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives.\n\n## d.  Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets include separately acquired intangible assets such as software, licenses, and intellectual property rights. They also include the technology, brands and customer contracts valued upon the acquisition of companies in accordance with IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nWith the exception of certain brands, intangible assets are amortized  using the  straight-line  method over their  useful lives. Information management systems are generally amortized over a period comprised between five and eight years and customer contracts over a maximum period  of 25 years, considering the probabilities of renewal.\n\n## e. Property, plant and equipment\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are carried at their acquisition cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\n\nIn the event of mandatory dismantling or asset removals, related costs are added to the initial cost of the relevant assets and provisions are recognized to cover these costs.\n\nInterest costs on borrowings to finance the construction of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized during the period of construction when they relate to the financing of industrial projects over a twelve-month construction period, or longer.\n\nWhere  parts  of an  item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted separately and depreciated over their own useful lives.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. The costs of major inspections and overhauls are recognized as a separate component of the asset and are depreciated over the period between two major overhauls.\n\nDepreciation is  calculated  according to the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 20 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 cylinders: 10 to 40 years;\n- \u25a0 production units: 15 to 20 years;\n- \u25a0 pipelines: 15 to 35 years;\n- \u25a0 other equipment: 5 to 30 years.\n\nThe estimated useful lives are reviewed regularly and changes in the estimates are recorded prospectively from the date of change.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## f. Impairment of assets\n\nThe Group regularly assesses whether there are any indications of asset impairment. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is  greater  than  its  recoverable  amount, defined as  the  higher  of the fair  value  less  costs to  sell  (net  fair  value)  and  the value in use.\n\nImpairment  tests are performed systematically once a  year for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\nAssets that do not  generate  largely  independent cash flows are grouped according to the cash-generating units (CGUs) to which they belong. A cash-generating unit is an identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash  inflows  of other  assets  or groups  of  assets.  They  are mainly  determined  on  a  geographical  basis  and  by  reference  to the markets in which the Group operates.\n\nIn practice, the Group performs impairment tests at various levels pursuant to these principles:\n\n- \u25a0 dedicated and on-site plants are tested individually;\n- \u25a0 pipelines and plants that provide these pipelines are tested at the network level;\n- \u25a0 liquid gas and hydrogen/CO plants are grouped together according to the plants' customer market;\n- \u25a0 other assets are allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units.\n\nThe cash-generating units of the Gas & Services activities  are determined on a geographical basis. The other activities are managed at a  worldwide level  (Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies).\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cashgenerating units that benefit from business combination synergies and which represent the levels at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.\n\nWhen performing impairment tests on cash-generating  units or groups of  cash-generating  units comprising goodwill, the  Group uses the market multiples  approach.  Insofar  as the  fair  value  is not significantly greater than the net carrying amount of the cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units, the Group confirms the  recoverable  amount of the  cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units using the estimated cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nFor other cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, and assets whose value is tested on an individual basis, the Group determines the recoverable amount using  the estimated cash flow approach (value in use).\n\nThe market multiples used are determined based on the market value of the Air Liquide Group. The differences between the resulting multiples and those  of  comparable companies  are not material.\n\nThe growth rates, taken into account with respect to the cash flow estimates for cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units, are determined based on the activity and geographical location of the CGU considered.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash  flows are measured over the  asset's estimated period  of use, taking  into account customer contract terms  and technical obsolescence.\n\nThe discount rate depends on the nature, the location of the asset and the customer market. It is determined according to the minimum level of profitability expected from the investment considering industrial and commercial risks and credit terms.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of an asset, a cash-generating unit or a group of cash-generating units is lower than its carrying amount,  an impairment  loss  is recognized immediately  through profit  and loss. An  impairment  loss of a  cash-generating  unit  is first allocated to goodwill.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount again,  the previously  recognized impairment loss  is  reversed  to the income statement, with the exception of impairment losses on goodwill, which cannot be reversed.\n\n## g.  Leases\n\nIn the course of its activity, the Group enters as a lessee in contracts mainly for the following types of assets:\n\n- \u25a0 land, buildings and offices;\n- \u25a0 transportation equipment, in particular for Industrial Merchant and Healthcare business lines;\n- \u25a0 other equipment.\n\nAccording to IFRS 16, any contract (apart from exceptions mentioned below) containing a lease leads to recognition on the lessee's balance sheet of a right-of-use of the leased asset and a lease liability related to the present value of the commitments for future lease payments (lease liability).\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys to the Group the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. In particular, the Group has concluded that transportation contracts which confer to the supplier the substantive right to substitute the vehicle throughout the period of use and/or the control on the choice of the route, the driver and maintenance policy, are  service contracts and do  not meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16.\n\nIn addition, the Group has chosen to use the following exemptions and not to apply IFRS 16:\n\n- \u25a0 to the  lease contracts having a lease terms of 12 months or less;\n- \u25a0 to the lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value, in particular, office and telephony equipment, computers and small IT equipment. Lease contracts for data centers are analyzed on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe main assumptions used to measure the right-of-use and the lease liability are:\n\n- \u25a0 lease  term. It corresponds to the non-cancellable period for which a lessee has the right to use an underlying asset, together  with periods covered  by an option  to extend or to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise (for options to extend) or not to exercise (for options to terminate) such options. The probability to  exercise or  not an option is determined by type of contracts or on a case-bycase basis according to contractual terms, regulatory environment and the nature of the underlying asset (in particular, its technical specificity and strategic location);\n- \u25a0 the discount rate used for evaluation of the lease liability. The discount rate retained is the  lessee's  incremental borrowing rate. Due to the centralized financing in the Group, it corresponds for each subsidiary to the interest rate for intragroup borrowings determined according to the currency of the lease contract, the country and the lease term taking into account the repayment profile (linear amortization of the lease liability).\n\nDeferred taxes relating to the right of use asset and lease liability arising from a single transaction are recognized on a net basis.\n\n## 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\n## a.  Non-current financial instruments\n\n## Non-consolidated investments\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies that are not accounted  for using  the equity  method are classified  as  assets measured at fair value. These investments are not held for trading, consequently, at initial recognition, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. In this case, changes in fair value are not  reclassified  to net result upon  disposal of these investments.\n\nDividends from these investments are recognized in other financial income.\n\n## Loans and other financial assets\n\nLoans and other financial assets are  initially  recognized at their fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost. Impairment tests are performed at each closing date. Any impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\n## b.  Trade and other-receivables\n\nTrade and other  receivables are measured at their transaction price upon initial recognition and then at amortized cost less any impairment losses based on expected credit losses model.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated on the basis of a  matrix consisting in using historical loss rates adjusted depending on actual observable conditions. Expected credit losses are estimated at each closing date in the following manner:\n\n- \u25a0 segregating trade receivables into appropriate groups, in particular  depending  on  the  activities  of  the  Group, type  and size of client and its market segment;\n- \u25a0 within each group  of trade receivables, determining of agebands;\n- \u25a0 for each age-band identification of losses realized in previous financial year;\n- \u25a0 adjusting if necessary historical loss rate depending on actual observable conditions in order to take into account, in particular, current market conditions, type of client, credit management practices of the Group as well as specific information concerning individual customers;\n- \u25a0 application of loss rates estimated  in this way  to  each  ageband of trade receivables.\n\nFor all construction contracts in progress at the year-end, the gross amounts payable by and to customers represent the sum of costs incurred plus profits recognized using the percentage of completion method, equivalent to total revenue recorded using the percentage of completion method, less the amount of  advances received.",

        "page_content": "Amounts payable by customers are presented in trade receivables.  Amounts due to  customers  are  presented in other current liabilities.\n\n## Assignments of trade receivables\n\nAssignments of trade receivables are derecognized from the balance sheet when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows related to these receivables to the assignee; or\n- \u25a0 the  Group retains the contractual  rights  to receive  the cash flows related to these receivables, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to the assignee in an arrangement that cumulatively meets the following three conditions:\n- -the Group has no obligation to pay to the assignee unless it collects the equivalent amount,\n- -the Group is prohibited from selling or pledging the receivables other than as security for the obligation to pay cash flows to the assignee,\n- -the Group has an obligation to remit any cash flows it collects on behalf of the assignee without material delay;\n- \u25a0 and the Group transfers substantially all the risks and awards of ownership of the receivables, in particular credit risk and risk of late payment.\n\n## c. Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, current bank accounts, and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and which are exposed to a negligible risk of change in value.\n\nShort-term investments include temporary cash investments maturing in less than three months (commercial paper, certificates of  deposit  and  money  market funds) whose minimum long-term rating is A (S&P) or A2 (Moody's).\n\nAs cash investments maturing in less than three months are exposed to a negligible risk of a change in value, they are recognized at historical cost (including accrued interest) which is considered to approximate fair value.\n\n## d.  Trade payables\n\nThe Group sets up supplier paying services agreements with partner banks to facilitate the processing of supplier invoices payments.  The  Group analyzes  the main  contract features that enable to keep the trade payables qualification. In particular, the Group ensures that the following characteristics are met:\n\n- \u25a0 no deviation of  the  payment  terms  of  the  underlying  payable between the financing party and the original supplier. In other words, the Group must pay to the bank no later than the payment term of invoice;\n- \u25a0 payment terms negotiations between Air Liquide and supplier must be conducted independently of any negotiation on paying service  agreement. In particular,  payment  terms  shall not  be subject to the supplier's success in selling invoices to the bank;\n- \u25a0 the  terms  of  contract  with the  supplier  shall not  be  explicitly linked to any payment  term  extension.  Payment term  with  a particular supplier must be homogenous, independently of the participation of a particular invoice in the program or not;\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 payment terms should stay within the ordinary industry/sector norms and local regulation, and should not be tied to the participation in the paying services agreement;\n- \u25a0 program structures should avoid debt-like features such as interest and fees paid by Air Liquide to the bank or supplier;\n- \u25a0 tri-party agreements between Air Liquide, the supplier and the bank  that pre-arrange  the  financing  of  the invoices  owed by Air Liquide to the supplier shall be avoided.\n\n## e. Current and non-current borrowings\n\nBorrowings  include  bonds  and  other  bank  borrowings  (including the put options granted to minority shareholders).\n\nAt inception, borrowings are recognized at fair value corresponding to the net proceeds collected. At each balance sheet date, except for put options granted to minority shareholders (see section 10 'Minority Interests'), they are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Under this method, the borrowing cost includes the redemption premiums and issuance costs initially deducted from the nominal amount of the borrowing in liabilities.\n\nBorrowings maturing in less than one year are classified as current borrowings.\n\nBorrowings  hedged by  interest  rate  swaps are recognized  on  a hedge accounting basis.\n\n## f. Derivative assets and liabilities\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks relating to the Group's financial and operating activities. For all these transactions, the Group applies hedge accounting and documents, at the inception of the transaction, the type of hedging relationship, the hedging instruments, and the nature and term of the hedged item.\n\nApplying hedge accounting has the following consequences:\n\n- \u25a0 fair value hedges for existing assets and liabilities: the hedged portion of the item is carried at fair value in the balance sheet. Any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement, where they are offset by the corresponding changes in  fair value  of  the  hedging instruments (except for the impact of premiums/discounts);\n- \u25a0 future cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recorded directly in equity (items that may be subsequently reclassified to income statement),  while  the change in  the  fair value of  the hedged item is not recognized in the balance sheet. The change in fair value of the ineffective portion is recognized in other financial income or expenses. When the hedged transactions occur and are recorded, amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified in the income statement;\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ineffective portion of changes in fair value is recognized in 'Other financial income and expenses'. Once the foreign entity subject to the net investment hedge is sold, the loss or profit initially recognized in translation reserves is recognized in profit or loss, within the gain or loss generated.\n\nHowever, in limited circumstances, certain types of derivatives do not qualify  for  hedge accounting; they  are  carried at  fair value through 'Other financial income and expenses' with an offsetting entry in financial assets and financial liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of assets, liabilities and derivatives is based on the market price at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 7. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\n## a.  Assets classified as held for sale\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified  as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This classification  occurs when  the Group  takes the  decision to sell them and that the sale is considered highly probable.\n\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale are presented on different lines  of  the balance sheet. They are measured  at  the lower  of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Assets classified as held for sale are no longer depreciated (amortized) as  of  the date  they are classified  as  assets  or disposal groups held for sale.\n\nWhen a sale involving the loss of control of the subsidiary is considered  highly probable, all the assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are classified as being held for sale, independently of whether or not the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after its sale.\n\n## b.  Discontinued operations\n\nA discontinued operation is a clearly identifiable component that the Group either has abandoned or that is classified as held for sale:\n\n- \u25a0 representing a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations;\n- \u25a0 being part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or,\n- \u25a0 being a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nOnce the criteria  are  met,  the  profit  and  loss  and  the  cash  flow from discontinued operations are presented separately in the income  statement and  the  consolidated cash flow  statement for each period.\n\n## 8. INVENTORIES AND WORK-IN-PROGRESS\n\nInventories  are  measured  at  the lower  of  cost  or net  realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, direct and indirect labor costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\nNet  realizable value  is  the  estimated  selling  price  in the  normal course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## 9. SHARE CAPITAL, RESERVES AND TREASURY SHARES\n\nAir Liquide's share capital is composed of ordinary shares.\n\nRetained earnings include the following items:\n\n- \u25a0 translation reserves: exchange differences arising from the translation into euros of financial statements prepared by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro are recorded in translation reserves. Fair value changes in net investment hedges of these foreign subsidiaries are also recorded in this reserve;\n- \u25a0 fair value of financial instruments: this item records accumulated fair value changes in the effective portion of cash flow hedge derivatives (transactions not yet recognized in the accounts);\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains and losses: all actuarial gains and losses and adjustments arising from the asset ceiling, net of deferred taxes, are recognized in consolidated reserves in the period in which they occur.\n\nWhen the Group buys back its own shares, they are classified as treasury shares at the purchase price and presented as a deduction from equity for the consideration paid. The profit or loss from the sale of treasury shares is recognized directly in equity, net of tax.\n\nFurthermore, acquisitions or disposals of minority interests, without change in control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders. Thus, the difference between the price paid to increase the percentage of interest in entities that are already controlled and the additional share of equity thus acquired is recognized  in  Shareholders' equity. Similarly,  a  decrease  in the Group's percentage interest in a controlled entity is accounted for as an equity transaction with no impact on profit or loss.\n\nDisposals of shares with loss of control give rise to the recognition in disposal gains or losses of the change in fair value calculated for  the  total  investment  at  the  date  of  disposal. Any  investments retained, where applicable, will be measured at fair value at the date when control is lost.\n\n## 10.  MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nTransactions with minority interests, without impact on the control, are considered as transactions with the Group's shareholders and are registered in shareholders' equity.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32, put options granted to minority shareholders are recorded as borrowings at the option's estimated strike price.\n\nThe share in the  net assets of  subsidiaries is  reclassified from 'Minority interests' to 'Borrowings'.\n\nDue to the absence of any specific IFRS guidance, the Group has elected to recognize the consideration for the difference between the strike price of the option granted and the value of the minority interests reclassified as borrowings in shareholders' equity -Group share.\n\nMinority interests in profit and loss do not change and still reflect present ownership interests.",

Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\nRestructuring provisions include only the direct costs arising from the restructuring and  are  recognized  in the  period in  which the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either begun or been announced. When these plans involve termination benefits, the resulting provisions are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n- \u25a0 when  the Group can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits;\n- \u25a0 when the provision of the related restructuring is recognized.\n\nA provision for losses on contracts is recognized when the expected benefits from  the contract are lower  than  the cost of satisfying the obligations under the contract.\n\n## b.  Pensions and employee benefits\n\nThe Group  provides its  employees with various pension plans, termination benefits, jubilees and other post-employment benefits for both active and retired employees. The characteristics of each plan vary according to the laws and regulations applicable in each country as well as each subsidiary policy.\n\nThese benefits are covered by two types of plan:\n\n- \u25a0 defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 defined benefit plans.\n\nThe  Group grants both defined benefit and  defined  contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole obligation is to pay regular contributions. The employer's obligation is limited to payment of the planned contributions. The employer  does not  grant any  guarantees on  the future  level  of benefits paid to the employee or retiree (means-based obligation). The annual pension expense is equal to the contribution paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation. It is recognized in 'Personnel expenses'.\n\nDefined benefit plans are those by which the employer guarantees the future level of benefits defined in the agreement, most often depending on the employee's salary and seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either financed by contributions to a fund specialized in managing the amounts received;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, retirement and similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take into account the following assumptions: salary increases, employee turnover, retirement date, life expectancy, inflation and appropriate discount rates for each country.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDefined  benefit plans  are covered  by  external  pension  funds in certain  cases. The  assets of  these  plans  are  mostly  invested in bonds or equities carried at their fair value.\n\nAll  actuarial  gains  and  losses  as  well  as  any  adjustment  arising from the asset ceiling are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nActuarial assumptions  used vary  according to the demographic and economic conditions prevailing in each country where the Group has pension plans.\n\nDiscount rates used to measure the present value of the Company's obligations  and  the  net  interest  cost  are determined by  reference to  market  yields  on  High-Quality corporate  bonds. Where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government bonds with the same maturity at the valuation date shall  be used.  In the  Euro  zone, the  United States, the  United Kingdom and Canada, discount rates were determined using tools designed by independent actuaries. Their database uses several hundred different corporate bonds with a minimum AA-rating and maturities ranging from one to 30 years. Cash flows of expected benefits are subsequently  discounted using  rates  associated  to each maturity.\n\nValuations are carried out annually by independent actuaries for significant plans and every three years for other plans unless there are  material  changes  in  assumptions  or  major  events  that necessitate a new calculation. Impacts related to defined benefit plans are registered as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the service cost, the gain relating to curtailments and settlements, and the actuarial gains and losses from other long-term benefits and recognized in 'Personnel expenses'. In addition, the  service cost  of defined benefit plans which  are capped, linked to length of service and require the presence of the beneficiary  in the  company at the time  of retirement is spread over the period between the date on which the services rendered began to generate rights and the date on which the additional services cease to generate rights;\n- \u25a0 net interest cost  for defined benefits  is registered in 'Other financial income and expenses';\n- \u25a0 past service cost is recorded in profit or loss according to the nature of the change to the plan that generated it (i.e. either in 'Personnel expenses' or in 'Other operating income and expenses');\n- \u25a0 actuarial gains and losses from defined benefit plans, retirement termination payments, and medical plans are recorded in 'Gains and losses recognized directly in equity'.\n\n## 12.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\n\nForeign currency transactions are recognized according to the following principles:\n\n- \u25a0 foreign currency transactions are translated by each company into its functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction;\n- \u25a0 at year-end, monetary assets and liabilities  denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the closing exchange rate.\n\nExchange differences relating to commercial transactions are recognized in operating profit. For financial transactions, exchange differences are recognized in financial income and expenses except for differences resulting from the hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity that are directly recognized in equity until the net investment is removed from the consolidation scope.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nContingent assets and liabilities arise from past events, the outcome of which depends on future uncertain events.\n\nContingent liabilities represent:\n\n- \u25a0 possible obligations arising from past events whose existence will  be confirmed  only  by  the occurrence of  uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or,\n- \u25a0 present obligations that arise from past events, but that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle  the  obligation or  because  the  amount  of  the  obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\nContingent assets and liabilities that are material are disclosed in the notes to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements, except for contingent  liabilities  assumed in  a  business combination, which are recognized in accordance with IFRS 3 revised.\n\n## 14.  GOVERNMENT GRANTS\n\nGovernment grants received are initially recognized in 'Other noncurrent liabilities'. They are then recognized as income in the income statement for the period:\n\n- \u25a0 on the same basis as the subsidized assets are depreciated in the case of government grants related to assets;\n- \u25a0 deducted  from  the costs  intended to be  compensated  in the case of government grants other than those related to assets.\n\nThe Group analyzes the  substance of government incentives delivered through the tax system and selects an accounting treatment consistent with such substance.\n\n## 15.  SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nThe Group grants stock options and performance shares to Executive Officers and some employees.\n\nStock options and performance shares are measured at fair value on the grant date. Their fair value is recognized as a 'Personnel expense' in the income statement with a corresponding increase in equity, and amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\n\nThe valuation is performed by an independent expert, using mathematical models appropriate to the characteristics  of each plan. It takes into account the market vesting conditions associated to each one. The fair value measured at the grant date is not subject to re-evaluation due to changes in market conditions.\n\nVesting conditions, other than market ones, have no impact on the fair value measurement of services received but adjust the expense that is recognized according to the number of equity instruments actually granted.\n\nThe dilution effect of non-vested stock option plans and performance share allocations is reflected in  the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## Share subscription option plans\n\nOptions are valued using the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 volatility: implicit;\n- \u25a0 risk-free interest rate: zero-coupon benchmark rate at the plan issue date and matching the various maturities retained;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate: based on the historical average annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. The resignation rate is used to extrapolate the number of options which will not be exercised due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## Performance shares allocation plans\n\nPerformance shares are measured at fair value, taking into account a discount on non-transferable shares. The cost of nontransferability is measured as the cost of a two-step strategy consisting in the forward sale of shares being non-transferable for four years (or five years depending on the plan) and the purchase on the spot market of the same number of shares funded by an amortizable loan with an in fine capital repayment.\n\nValuation is based upon the following main underlying assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 risk-free interest rate: four-year  zero-coupon  benchmark  rate (or five-year depending on the plan) at the plan issue date plus a credit margin that would be proposed to employees;\n- \u25a0 dividend growth rate: based on the historical average annual growth rate;\n- \u25a0 employee resignation rate: that of individuals belonging to the same age group as the plan beneficiaries. This resignation rate is used to extrapolate the shares which will not be allocated due to the resignation of beneficiaries;\n- \u25a0 the probability of achieving the market vesting conditions.\n\n## 16.  GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION QUOTAS\n\nIn certain countries, the Group is subject to greenhouse gas emission quota systems.\n\nIn the absence of any specific IFRS guidance, the  Group has elected to apply the  ANC Regulation No. 2014-03. The Group does  not buy CO2  quotas  for  the purpose of generating  profits from fluctuations in price; therefore, at each closing date:\n\n- \u25a0 a liability  is recognized  if  the greenhouse gas emissions are higher than the CO2 quotas held by the Group. It corresponds to the cost of CO2 quotas in shortfall to cover the greenhouse gas already emitted; or,\n- \u25a0 an  asset  is  recognized  if  the greenhouse  gas  emissions  are lower than the CO2 quotas held by the entity. It corresponds to the CO2 quotas available to cover the future greenhouse gas emissions, valued at historical cost.",

The segment designs, develops and builds industrial gas production plants for the Group and third parties. It also designs and manufactures plants in the traditional, renewable and alternative energy sectors.\n\nThe Global Markets & Technologies  segment  is also managed separately on a worldwide scale. It focuses on new markets which require a global approach, drawing on science, technologies, development models, and usages related to digital transformation.\n\nResearch and Development and corporate activities do not meet the operating segments definition and are thus presented within reconciliation.\n\nThe information communicated in  the tables covering segment information is presented according to the same accounting principles as those used for the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nRevenue is analyzed by geographical area of production (country of origin).\n\nInter-segment  revenue between Gas & Services,  Engineering  & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies activities corresponds to the sales between these operating segments.\n\nThe Group operating  performance is  assessed on the  basis  of each segment's Operating income recurring.\n\nSegment assets include non-current assets, with the exception of 'Deferred tax assets', 'Investments in associates', 'Fair value of non-current derivatives (assets)', as well as 'Inventories and work-in-progress', 'Trade receivables' and 'Other current assets'.\n\nSegment liabilities correspond to 'Provisions, pensions and other employee benefits', 'Trade payables', 'Other current liabilities' and 'Other non-current liabilities'.\n\nSegment profits, assets and liabilities consist of amounts directly attributable  to  each segment, provided  they can  be allocated  to the segment on a reasonable basis.\n\n## 2. NET DEBT\n\nThe net debt includes:\n\n- \u25a0 current and non-current borrowings, as defined in section 6.e of accounting policies, minus the fair value of hedging derivative assets to cover borrowings;\n\nreduced by:\n\n- \u25a0 cash and cash equivalents, as defined in section 6.c of accounting policies, minus the fair value of hedging derivative instruments recorded in liabilities to cover loans.\n\nThe net debt does not include the lease liabilities as defined in section 5.g of accounting policies.\n\n## 3. INFORMATION ON INTERESTS IN JOINT ARRANGEMENTS OR ASSOCIATES\n\nThe materiality of the interests in joint arrangements or associates is assessed according to the following criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 contribution of the entity to the Group's Operating income recurring;\n- \u25a0 share of these interests in the Group's net assets;\n- \u25a0 dividends paid to these interests.\n\n## 4. INFORMATION ON MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nThe materiality of the minority interests is assessed according to an analysis of:\n\n- \u25a0 the minority interests' share in the Group's net assets;\n- \u25a0 the contribution to the Group's Operating income recurring of the subsidiary having minority interests;\n- \u25a0 dividends paid to minority interests.\n\n## 5. OPERATING INCOME RECURRING\n\nThe Group's operating performance is measured based on Operating income or loss recurring determined in accordance with ANC recommendation No. 2020-01.\n\n## 6. OTHER NON-RECURRING OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES\n\nMaterial non-recurring operations that could affect operating performance readability are classified under 'Other non-recurring operating income' and 'Other non-recurring operating expenses'. They may include:\n\n- \u25a0 gains or losses on the disposal of activities or groups of assets;\n- \u25a0 acquisition-related and integration-related costs relating to business combinations;\n- \u25a0 restructuring costs resulting from plans whose unusual and material nature distort the readability of the Operating income recurring;\n- \u25a0 significant provisions and impairment losses for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;\n- \u25a0 incurred or estimated costs relating to significant political risks or litigations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Air Liquide's presence in Ukraine was limited to a commercial office and engineering services office for the Engineering & Construction activity. In Russia, the Group mainly operated in the Large Industries, Industrial Merchant and Healthcare business lines. The revenue realized in Russia represented less than 1% of the Group's consolidated revenue in 2021.\n\nAs  of  June 30, 2022, in  view of the  very uncertain geopolitical context, the series of successive sanctions and counter-sanctions and restrictions in terms of cash movements between Russia and Europe, the Group determined that indications of impairment existed for the assets held in Russia that required to carry out an impairment test. As a result, a provision of 404 million euros on these assets was recognized in Other non-recurring operating expenses, with no impact on cash, as well as the costs of unwinding hedges and mothballing certain projects in the amount of 15 million euros.\n\nOn September 2, 2022, Air Liquide confirmed its intention to withdraw from Russia. Taking a responsible and orderly approach, the Group signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the local management team with  the objective  to  transfer its activities in\n\nRussia in a framework of an MBO (Management Buy Out). This project is notably subject to Russian regulatory approvals.\n\nFurthermore, as a consequence of the evolution of the geopolitical context and increased sanctions and counter-sanctions, the Group updated its analysis of the control it holds over activities in Russia and considered that it no longer satisfied the conditions of control as defined by IFRS 10 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and described in section 1.a of the accounting principles and methods in the appendix to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, the Group's activities in Russia are no more consolidated since September 1, 2022. The corresponding shares are now recognized as  non-consolidated investments, with an estimated fair value of zero given the specific context.\n\nThe total impact for the Group amounts to 586 million euros over the 2022 financial year, recognized in Other non-recurring operating expenses, and corresponds mainly to the provision for impairment, the impairment of non-consolidated investments and financial receivables that the Group holds with these Russian entities.",

The key  model  assumptions used,  such  as  market multiples  and  the  discount  rate,  took  into account the stock market and world economic context.\n\nThe market multiples used were determined using the Air Liquide Group market value as of December 31, 2022. Multiples obtained do not materially differ from those of companies whose activity is similar to that of the Group.\n\nIf need be, the growth rates used for estimating the cash flows of cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units were significantly lower than the Group's historical average growth rates. Growth rates are comprised between 1% and 3% in mature markets, and up to 5.5% in emerging markets. The weighted average cost of capital used was 5.6% as of December 31, 2022 (4.1% as of December 31, 2021). The weighted average cost of\n\ncapital is adjusted for the activity and the geographical location of the cash-generating units being tested.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the recoverable amounts  of  each cash-generating  unit  or groups  of cash-generating units significantly exceeded their net carrying amounts.\n\nConsidering the activity  of  the Air  Liquide  Group, no reasonably possible change in key assumptions would result in an impairment. The Gas & Services activities favor synergies between the different business lines by pooling assets for a given geographical area. The geographical development of the activity is generally based on  local  industrial investments and external growth operations throughout the Large Industries business line. The supply of gas to clients  of  the  Large  Industries  business  is contracted for a minimum duration of 15 years. These customer contracts provide a good visibility and guarantee of future income.",

Options granted since October 14, 2011 must be exercised within 10 years.\n\nA four-year vesting period applies to stock options granted.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the number of outstanding share options granted by the Board of Directors under the plans approved by Annual General Meetings amounted to 1,340,889 options after adjustment (average price of 72.38 euros), or 0.26% of share capital.\n\nOut of the total number of options issued pursuant to the approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 4, 2022, 10,469,005 options were retained for possible grant by the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Performance shares plans\n\nAn additional compensation system involving performance shares was set up in 2008 as a way to reward best employees and associate their medium-term performance with the Company's objectives.\n\nThe 21 st resolution adopted by the Extraordinary Annual General Meeting held on May 4, 2022 authorizes the Board of Directors to grant free shares to Group employees, up to a maximum of 0.5% of the Company's share capital over a 38-month period. As part of this maximum attribution, free shares representing up to 0.1% of the Group's share capital can be granted to corporate officers over the same period.\n\nUnder this authority, the Board of Directors adopted two different general  regulations on  September 29,  2022 ('France'  Plan and 'World' Plan) governing the attribution of performance shares to beneficiaries determined by the Board of Directors. The differences between the 'France' and 'World' Plans mainly refer to the number of years of service required - paragraph a) below, and to the correlative absence of any holding requirement for the 'World' Plan - paragraph c) below.\n\nThe granted shares shall be either shares issued through a capital increase performed by the Company by no later than the definitive vesting date or shares bought back by the Company in the market prior to such date.\n\nTo date, performance shares granted are treasury shares bought back as part of the Company's shares buyback program.",

In the event of retirement,  the beneficiary retains his  rights, being  no  longer required to satisfy the continued service requirement;\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- b) performance requirements for all performance shares allocated to all beneficiaries which are now identical to performance requirements applicable to stock-options;\n- c) a holding  requirement for performance shares: as from the final grant date, the beneficiaries of the 'France' Plan are required  to  hold their shares for  two  additional  years  during which such shares may not be transferred (except in the event of disability or death).\n\nOptions granted to the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) who were attributed the highest number of options\n\nIn 2022, no options have been granted.\n\n## Options exercised in 2022 by the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) with the highest number of options exercised\n\n| Grant date   | Number of options exercised   |   Average price (in euros) (a) |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 09/27/2012   | 36,889                        |                          69.92 |\n| 09/26/2013   | 31,538                        |                          68.71 |\n| 09/22/2014   | 19,270                        |                          75.31 |\n| 09/28/2015   | 3,747                         |                          81.46 |\n| 11/29/2016   | 76                            |                          69.33 |\n| TOTAL        | 91,520                        |                          71.11 |\n\n(a) Historical data.\n\n## Options exercised in 2021 by the ten employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (excluding corporate officers) with the highest number of options exercised\n\n| Grant date         | Number of options exercised   |   Average price (in euros) (a) |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 10/14/2011         | 7,198                         |                          57.28 |\n| 10/14/2011 Belgium | 3,393                         |                          57.94 |\n| 09/27/2012         | 68,004                        |                          70.14 |\n| 09/26/2013         | 20,179                        |                          74.06 |\n| 09/22/2014         | 9,605                         |                          77.67 |\n| 09/28/2015         | 4,500                         |                          84.08 |\n| TOTAL              | 112,879                       |                          70.85 |\n\n(a) Historical data.\n\n## Number of share subscription options and weighted average strike price\n\n|                                                                                  | 2021         | 2021                                       | 2022      | 2022                                       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                  | Options  (a) | Weighted average  strike price  (in euros) | Options   | Weighted average  strike price  (in euros) |\n| Total number of options outstanding as of January 1  (adjusted number and price) | 2,475,317    | 69.72                                      | 1,700,972 | 71.39                                      |\n| Options exercised during the period (adjusted number and price)                  | 759,959      | 65.93                                      | 352,635   | 71.14                                      |\n| Options canceled during the period (adjusted number and price)                   | 14,386       | 72.57                                      | 7,448     | 72.43                                      |\n| Total number of options as of December 31  (adjusted number and price)           | 1,700,972    | 71.39                                      | 1,340,889 | 72.38                                      |\n| Of which total number of options eligible for exercise                           | 1,616,414    | 70.52                                      | 1,340,889 | 72.38                                      |\n\n(a) The total number of outstanding options at the beginning of the period was adjusted following the capital increase with free shares attribution in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

administrative proceedings. The potential costs of such proceedings are provided for, when they are probable, only if the amount can be quantified or estimated within a  reasonable  range. In the  latter case, the  amount  provided for represents the best estimate of the Group's management. Provisions are determined based on a case-by-case risk assessment and events occurring during ongoing proceedings may result in a risk reappraisal at any time. These litigations are by nature diverse and involve various Group subsidiaries. Contingency provisions recorded with respect to all Group litigations  amounted to 185.8 million  euros  as  of  December 31,\n\n2022 (228.5 million euros as of December 31, 2021) and are presented in 'Other provisions'. They include provisions for industrial disputes and for tax risks, excluding income taxes, respectively for 127.0 and 58.8 million euros.\n\nThe Group does not provide the detail of these provisions, considering that disclosing the amount provided for each individual litigation could be prejudicial to the Group. Nevertheless, no single litigation is likely to have a material effect on the Group's financial position or its profitability.",

PENSION PLANS\n\nThe most significant pension plans relate to France, Germany and the United States.\n\nIn France, Air Liquide provides an additional  retirement  benefit based on the final salary which is paid in addition to other normal pension plans. On December 31, 1995, this plan was closed to employees under age 45 or with less than 20 years of service as of January 1, 1996; the latter being covered by a defined contribution plan. These plans are unfunded. The annual amounts paid with regards to additional benefits cannot exceed a threshold set  originally  at  12%  of  total  payroll  or  12%  of  pre-tax profits  of companies involved.  This 12%  threshold will be  proportionately reduced  by  comparing  the number of  plan beneficiaries  for the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. In 2017, this additional benefit was funded subsequently to the Article 50 of the law of January 20, 2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nIAS 19 'Employee Benefits' provides a very restrictive definition of defined contribution plans; any plans not complying fully with the conditions required are defined benefit plans by default.\n\nThis restrictive definition of defined contribution plans requires Air  Liquide  to  account  for  these  additional  benefits  as  a  defined benefit plan in spite of the limited obligations for the Company and the nature of the obligations not being stable or continuous.\n\nThe qualification as a defined benefit plan results in the recognition of a provision with regards to the future obligations.\n\nWith the Company's obligations being limited, the valuation of what will actually be paid to retirees is uncertain. Since the effect of this threshold cannot be measured reliably, the provision recognized  represents  the actuarial value  of  the  amounts  to  be paid out to retirees until the plan is closed, excluding any potential threshold effect. The additional retirement benefit paid by Air Liquide is aligned with the indexation of French statutory and supplementary pension plans up to a maximum annuity. Any additional annuity will not be subject to any indexation. The effects related to the revaluation cap  and  floor were  accounted  for in 'Other financial expenses'.\n\nIn Germany, there are two main Air Liquide pension plans.\n\nThe first plan provides the retirees of Lurgi (Engineering & Construction activity) with a lifetime annuity, based on the income  and  length of  service vested  in  the plan at  the time  of retirement, the normal  retirement age being 65.  The plan also provides disability and widowhood pensions.  This plan is now closed to new entrants, the latter benefiting from a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe second plan is an old plan covering  employees of the Gas & Services activities. The plan provides a lifetime annuity, based on the  average  income  earned over  the employee's  career and the length of service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement  age being 65.  The  plan also provides disability, preretirement and widowhood pensions. It is now closed to new entrants, with new employees benefiting from another defined benefit plan. Providing a minimum length of service of ten years, the plan provides a lifetime annuity based on the average income earned over the employee's career and the length of service vested at the time of retirement, the normal retirement age being 65. The plan also provides disability, pre-retirement and widowhood pensions.\n\nIn accordance with common market practice in Germany, limited funding contributions are made to pension funds as both plans are mainly managed internally.\n\nIn the United States, Air Liquide grants retirees supplemental benefits in addition to  the normal pension plans. The US plan provides a traditional final average pay benefit to those who continue to accrue benefits. A retiring employee may elect to receive their pension benefit as a lump sum or a lifetime annuity. This plan was closed to new participants in 2004 and was frozen in  2016.  Therefore,  employees  who  joined the  Company before 2004  are  no  longer  acquiring  new  rights on this  defined  benefit plan, but benefit from the defined contribution plan that has been opened since 2004 to new employees.\n\nA new plan was implemented on January 1, 2017 (Supplemental Saving plan). This  plan  comes  on  top  of the  basic  savings  plan offering  additional  retirement  benefits  beyond the tax limit of the basic  plan.  It  represents  an  annual  cost  of  around 7  million  US dollars.",

PENSION PLAN RISK ANALYSIS\n\n## Sensitivity to movements in discount rates and other variables\n\nThe present value of obligations related to defined benefit plans is measured by discounting  future cash  flows. Discount  rates  are determined based on Government bonds rates or, when the financial markets are sufficiently liquid, on 'high-quality' corporate bond rates, which can vary from one period to another.\n\nChanges in discount rates can materially change the present value of the Group's obligations and the expense recorded in the year.\n\nThe amount of obligations is affected to a lesser extent by revised wages and inflation indexes, as well as legal changes regarding retirement age or official mortality tables.\n\n## Impact of a -0.25% decrease in discount rates\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of December 31, 2022  (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2022   |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                      34 | 2.7 %                                             |\n| Americas        |                                                                      17 | 2.4 %                                             |\n| Asia-Pacific    |                                                                       1 | 1.9 %                                             |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                      52 | 2.6 %                                             |\n\n|                 |   Impact on obligations as of December 31, 2021  (in millions of euros) | % of total obligations as of  December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Europe / Africa |                                                                      55 | 3.3 %                                             |\n| Americas        |                                                                      28 | 3.0 %                                             |\n| Asia-Pacific    |                                                                       1 | 1.0 %                                             |\n| TOTAL           |                                                                      84 | 3.1 %                                             |",

Any adverse movement in these variables would require additional Group contributions to the pension funds on a timely basis.\n\nPlan assets consist of shares, bonds and other assets whose value is subject to market fluctuations. A downturn in the financial markets would increase the net liabilities of defined benefit plans.

NET DEBT BY CURRENCY\n\nThe Group ensures a natural hedge and reduces its exposure to currency fluctuations by raising debt mainly in the currency of the cash flows that are generated to repay the debt. In most countries, and  especially  outside the  euro,  US dollar,  Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi zones, financing is raised in either local or foreign currency (EUR or USD) when sales contracts are indexed to foreign currency. Debt  in  other currencies is mainly denominated in Taiwan dollar, South African Rand, Singapore dollar, British pound sterling and in Canadian dollar.\n\nAs part of intra-group multi-currency financing, the Central Treasury Department converts the debt raised in financial markets into  various  currencies  to  finance  subsidiaries  in  their  functional currencies  or  their  cash  flow  currencies.  The  breakdown of this hedging portfolio is shown in the table below.\n\nAccordingly, a portion of the euro debt raised was converted (1,622.0 million euros) to other currencies to finance foreign subsidiaries.  As an  example, 3,543.5 million euros were  raised initially in US dollar, and 537.3 million euros were raised in euros and converted in US dollar using currency swap contracts. 296.3 million euros were in cash or cash equivalent, leading to an adjusted net debt in US dollars of 3,784.5 million euros.\n\n| 2022 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt -  original issue   | Interest rate and  currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Adjusted net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| EUR                           | 7,209.7                        | (1,622.0)                           | (892.7)                      | 4,695.0             |\n| USD                           | 3,543.5                        | 537.3                               | (296.3)                      | 3,784.5             |\n| JPY                           | 108.8                          | 218.2                               | (13.6)                       | 313.4               |\n| CNY                           | 314.6                          | (45.8)                              | (213.9)                      | 54.9                |\n| TWD                           | 387.9                          |                                     | (12.1)                       | 375.8               |\n| ZAR                           | 264.2                          |                                     | (41.4)                       | 222.8               |\n| Other currencies              | 344.0                          | 912.3                               | (441.4)                      | 814.9               |\n| TOTAL                         | 12,172.7                       |                                     | (1,911.4)                    | 10,261.3            |\n\n| 2021 (in millions of euros)   | Gross debt - original  issue   | Interest rate and  currency swaps   | Cash and cash  equivalents   | Adjusted net debt   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| EUR                           | 7,743.7                        | (2,061.9)                           | (1,340.1)                    | 4,341.7             |\n| USD                           | 3,671.4                        | 1,052.1                             | (292.6)                      | 4,430.9             |\n| JPY                           | 117.7                          | 82.9                                | (19.2)                       | 181.4               |\n| CNY                           | 230.8                          | (115.5)                             | (208.6)                      | (93.3)              |\n| ZAR                           | 310.3                          |                                     | (27.6)                       | 282.7               |\n| Other currencies              | 621.0                          | 1,042.4                             | (358.5)                      | 1,304.9             |\n| TOTAL                         | 12,694.9                       |                                     | (2,246.6)                    | 10,448.3            |\n\n## 24.6.

OTHER FINANCING INFORMATION\n\nThree  financial covenants are associated to bank  debt  facilities exceeding 50 million euros: they are long term loans used by Air Liquide  Arabia (Saudi  Arabia) and  Air Liquide Large Industries South Africa (South Africa), for a total outstanding amount of 327 million euros as of December 31, 2022. Financial covenants were all met as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe amount of bank credit facilities subject to financial covenants represents around 4.0% of the Group's gross debt as of December 31, 2022.\n\nBonds issued by L'Air Liquide S.A. and Air Liquide Finance, and making up the carrying amount of bonds as of December 31, 2022, include a change of control clause.\n\n## Note 25 Financial risk policy and management\n\n## 25.1.  FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nRisk  management is a priority  for  the  Group.  Consequently,  the Finance Department governance relies on Strategic Finance Committees and Operational Finance Committees.\n\nThe Finance Department centrally manages the main financial risks, in accordance with decisions taken by the Strategic Finance Committee to which it  reports  on a regular basis. The Finance Department also performs  country  and customer  risks analyses associated with investment decisions and attends Investment Committee meetings.\n\nThe financial policy adopted by Air Liquide, the purpose of which is to minimize the risks incurred by the Group and its subsidiaries, enables the Group to ensure sustainable funding sources. To minimize the refinancing risk related to debt maturity schedules, the Group diversifies financing sources and spreads maturities over  several years.  In  2022,  the  average debt  maturity  was 5.9 years. As of December 31, 2022, the long-term debt (gross debt maturing in more than one year) represented 84% of the overall Group debt, compared to 83% as of December 31, 2021.\n\nInterest rate, commodities and foreign currency hedging strategies validated by  the Operational  Finance Committee  are set up depending on market opportunities , while complying with prudence and risk limitation principles.\n\nThe Group also pays continuous attention to its bank and customer counterparty risks by regularly monitoring ratings issued by main international rating agencies and the level of risk associated with these counterparties. An internal ratings system, set-up in  2018, is used  for  the  most important  clients when  no leading credit ratings agency information is available.\n\n## a) Foreign exchange risk\n\n## Principles\n\nFinancial  instruments  are only  used to hedge transaction-based foreign exchange  risk.  The risk  is attached  on  the one  hand  to financial  cash  flows  arising  from  royalties,  dividends,  intra-group loans and borrowings denominated in foreign  currencies  and  on the other  hand  to  foreign currency  commercial cash flows  from operating entities.  Although  in  slight  increase, commercial  cash flows denominated in foreign currencies do not represent significant amounts compared to consolidated revenue.\n\nForeign exchange risk related to royalties, dividend flows and intra-group loans and borrowings in foreign currencies is hedged by  the  Central  Treasury  Department  using  currency  forwards  or options  with an overall term of  less than 18 months. Currency hedging of intra-group loans and borrowings uses currency forwards.\n\nForeign currency  commercial  cash  flows from  operating  entities are hedged  either as part of  the annual budgetary process for subsidiaries with recurring flows in foreign currency or at the signing date of a sale or purchase contract for non-recurring flows for the Engineering & Construction business line. Around a hundred subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange risk. These subsidiaries  mainly  use  currency  forwards set  up  by Air Liquide Finance (internal counterparty for hedging transactions) except in countries where it is prohibited by local regulations. The majority of these contracts have short maturities (three to twelve months) and market transactions are regulated by master agreements of the French Banking Federation ('FBF') or by master agreements of the International Swaps and Derivative Association ('ISDA') for local  hedging operations.  These do not include collateralization commitments or margin calls.\n\nWhen preparing their budget at the year-end, subsidiaries report their foreign exchange risk exposure to the Central Treasury Department in order to hedge the commercial cash flows expected in the following year. In each case, the Central Treasury Department monitors the adequacy of the hedges with the identified risks and performs a full revaluation of all hedges, every six months.\n\nThe foreign  exchange  translation  risk (consolidation  in  euros  of the assets and liabilities in currencies) is not subject to hedging. Indeed, investments are essentially funded in the currency in which the cash flows are generated, thus creating a natural currency hedging.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regarding other currencies, the Finance Department provides  subsidiaries  with  advice  as to  the different types of bank loans and/or hedging transactions to enter into according to the characteristics of local financial markets.\n\nhedging instruments. This approach enables the Group to limit the effect of interest rate fluctuations on financial expenses.\n\nConsequently,  at  the  2022  year-end, 94% of the  total  debt  was fixed-rate debt. The fixed-rate/floating-rate breakdown is reviewed on a regular basis by the Finance Committees, depending on interest rate fluctuations and the level of Group debt.\n\nThe Group policy is to maintain the major portion of total debt at fixed rates and to protect the residual balance using optional\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on floating-rate debt\n\nThe Group net debt exposed to interest rate fluctuations amounted to around 432 million equivalent euros as of December 31, 2022, for an average outstanding amount of 0.8 billion equivalent euros (total debt adjusted for interest rate hedging instruments and short-term securities) in slight increase compared to December 31, 2021 (0.7 billion equivalent euros).\n\nAn increase or decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points (\u00b11%) on all  yield  curves  would  have  an  effect  of  approximately \u00b18 million euros on the Group's annual cost of debt (accounted in financial charges) before tax, assuming outstanding floating debt remains constant.\n\n## Sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations on derivatives and their underlying hedged items\n\nThe table below shows the effect of a 1% fluctuation of interest rates in all foreign currencies on the interest rate derivatives portfolio in the Group's net profit and equity, as of December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                             | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   | Interest rate risk   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                                                             | +1.0%                | +1.0%                | -1.0%                | -1.0%                |\n| (in millions of euros)                                      | P&L impact           | Equity impact        | P&L impact           | Equity impact        |\n| Interest rate derivatives and their hedged underlying items | (0.3)                | 38.9                 | (0.2)                | (39.1)               |",

        "page_content": "To protect the Group against the increase of variable rates applicable to short-term financing (commercial papers) and to other exposure to variable rates in 2023, the Group set up 6 firm hedges for 148 million euros and 200 million US dollar. They were completed  by optional hedges for  a  total  amount  of  140 million euros and 200 million US dollar.\n\nAll hedging instruments used for interest rate or foreign exchange risk management purposes relate to identified risks and were set up to comply with the Group's financial policy. The effect on equity primarily stems from the fixed-rate hedging instruments contracted by the subsidiary Air Liquide Finance.\n\n## c) Counterparty risk\n\nCounterparty  risks for  Air Liquide potentially include customers and bank counterparties.\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries serve a large number of customers (more than two million worldwide) located in extremely diverse markets: chemicals, steel, refining, food, pharmaceuticals, metals, automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, research laboratories, electronics,  etc.  In  2022, the  Group's  main  customer  represents around  2%  of  revenue,  the  Group's  10  main customers  around 15% of sales, and the Group's 50 main customers around 35% of sales. The geographical risk is limited by the Group's sustainable coverage in 73 countries (1) on all continents. This diversity reduces customer and market risk.\n\nTo better assess its exposure, the Group has implemented procedures to regularly monitor the financial situation of its major customers  as well as a monthly reporting for the  Group's  171 main transnational customers in order to monitor the related consolidated risk.\n\nMoreover, customer risk assessment and in particular the quality of the customer's site is an important component of the investment decision process.\n\nBank counterparty risk relates to the outstanding amounts of deposits,  current  accounts,  market values  of  derivatives  and  to the credit lines contracted with each bank. Pursuant to its financial policy, in  the majority  of  cases, the  Group  requires a long-term\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nStandard & Poor's 'A' credit rating or a Moody's 'A2' rating from its counterparties to accept commitments on financial instruments. The Group's  credit  lines are also spread among  several banks from various geographical areas to avoid the risk of concentration while complying  with the same credit rating requirements.  The Operational  Finance Committee regularly  reviews  and approves the list of bank counterparties related to investments and the list of  financial  instruments.  With  regards  to  short-term  investments, outstandings are subject to strict limits per counterparty and are monitored daily.\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement specifies that the valuation of currency, interest rate and commodity hedging instruments must take into  account  the counterparty credit  risk  attached to these transactions. Considering the aforementioned counterparty selection criteria, the effect on the periodic valuations, by applying the historical default probabilities method is immaterial.\n\n## d) Liquidity risk\n\nIt is  Group financial  policy to  spread over  time the maturity  of long-term debt in order to avoid concentration of annual refinancing needs. Liquidity risk is also reduced by the stability of cash flows generated from operations as well as by having confirmed credit lines in place. The financial covenants attached to  the  current  financing  arrangements described in note 24.7 do not affect the Group's access to liquidity.\n\nThe carrying amount of short-term financing in the form of commercial paper amounted to 131 million euros as of December 31, 2022, a decrease by 113 million euros compared to the end of 2021. The average amount of commercial paper amounted to 756 million euros in 2022, compared to 516 million euros in 2021.\n\nThe Group policy requires that commercial paper in issue be backed by confirmed long-term credit lines. In 2022, this requirement was met, with an amount of confirmed credit lines of 3,600 million euros largely exceeding maximum outstanding commercial paper.\n\nThe table below presents the maturities of the bilateral and syndicated credit lines:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2023   |   2024 | 2025   |   2026 |   2027 | 2028   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Bilateral lines and syndicated credit lines | -      |    500 | 2,500  |    400 |    200 | -      | 3,600   |\n\nWhen the Group makes short-term financial investments other than bank deposits, it systematically favors monetary instruments with a short-term maturity in order to limit the risk of non-liquidity or high volatility.\n\nThe following tables represent the future cash flows related to the main balance sheet items and to the derivative financial instruments recognized at the end of the last two periods. Interest flows are calculated in accordance with IFRS 7 and represent the\n\n(1)\n\ninterest payable for each relevant period. Interest flows related to floating interest rate or foreign currency instruments were calculated  using the closing interest  and  exchange rates as  of December 31, 2021 and 2022. The flows related to debt repayment obligations differ  from  the  amounts recognized in the Group's balance sheet due to the accounting treatment applied to borrowings and the exclusion of hedging instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As  Air Liquide does not purchase electricity or natural gas for speculation or arbitrage on commodity price trends purposes, no forward contracts relating to energy meet the definition of a derivative instrument. The contracts enter into as part of the Company's normal business to be used in the industrial process and do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument.\n\nFurthermore,  in  a  global  context of  highly  volatile  electricity and natural gas market prices, Air Liquide continues to index long-term\n\ncustomer contracts to hedge these risks. For natural gas and electricity prices, the opening  of some markets led the Group, under these circumstances, to replace the regulated tariffs by local market indices.\n\nNonetheless, a few  contracts remain  for which price  indexation alone  cannot  guarantee a total  and effective  hedge  against  the risk of energy prices fluctuations. These risks are therefore hedged by Air Liquide, particularly by Air Liquide Finance, using adequate commodity derivatives, which are mainly swaps with maturities of generally less than two years. For contracts for the supply of  industrial gas produced from renewable energy,  new risks to be taken into account (long-term commitment, fixed price, intermittency, management of environmental certificates, etc.) could lead the Group to make greater use of appropriate hedging instruments.\n\nThe fair value recognition of these derivative instruments had no material impact on Group  equity or  profits  as  of  December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In consideration, Exeltium and its  shareholder  clients signed long-term  electricity supply contracts. The contract signed by Air Liquide has a 20-year term  and  can  be  suspended by Air  Liquide  after  10  years.  This contract provides long-term visibility over the price of the electricity to be supplied. This project was approved by the European Commission.\n\nThe Group's energy purchase commitments amounted to 5,442.8 million euros as of December 31, 2022 (2,673.9 million euros as of  December 31,  2021).  In  2022, the Group has signed  significant  Power  Purchase Agreements.  The first  one  for  15  years  duration  with  Vattenfall  in the  Netherlands amounting to 402 million euros, and two others with Enel Green Power in South Africa for 392 million euros. Those contracts will start in 2025 and are therefore not yet subject to mutual commitments received  from  clients  in  connection  with  long-term gas supply contracts.\n\nAlmost all of these commitments, except the ones mentioned above, are covered by mutual commitments received from clients in connection with long-term gas supply contracts. These commitments are not disclosed in the table above.\n\nThe 2022 plan performance shares granted to corporate officers and Executive Committee members cannot be exercised unless certain performance conditions are achieved.\n\nNo  stock  options or performance shares  were granted to other non-executive Directors under these plans.",

BUSINESS MODEL\n\nAir Liquide supplies gas and energy solutions to customers in the metals, chemicals, refining and energy industries, which are essential for their own core businesses, to improve process efficiency and to make their plants more environmentally friendly.\n\nAir  Liquide's  business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gas needs of its customers who often emit greenhouse gases themselves, in particular in the metals, chemicals and refining industries.  This outsourcing  is justified by  Air Liquide's expertise which grants them access to state of the art technologies, optimized energy consumption of production tools, while ensuring the reliability of the supply in the long term. However,  it  leads  to  the transfer of a portion  of  the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nIndustrial gases are used in most industries today and they will be even more so during the energy transition because they are at the heart of industry decarbonization solutions. Demand will increasingly turn to low-carbon gases, in line with changing regulations.\n\nFor the Large Industries activity, which bears most of the assets described below, the supply of gas is contracted for 15 years or more. Such assets are depreciated over the term of the contract, which substantially  reduces  the  risk of impairment. Within these contracts, the Group guarantees long-term service continuity and a high level of reliability with respect to the gas supply via a highperforming industrial solution. In return, long-term gas supply contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through take-orpay clauses,  as  well  as  the indexation  to  variable  costs (mainly electricity  and natural gas), including any CO2 cost (for example ETS schema in Europe), and inflation.\n\n## 31.2.  GROUP'S ASSETS AND CO \u2082 EMISSIONS\n\nThe main Group assets that impact the CO2 balance are:\n\n- \u25a0 424 large Air Separation Units (ASU), oxygen and nitrogen in particular,  which do  not use  any combustion  processes and consume almost exclusively electrical energy, and therefore do not generate any CO2 emissions. However, electricity used by the  Group to  power  these  units generate  CO2 emissions at electricity suppliers;  such  emissions  are classified  as  indirect emissions (scope 2). The CO2 emissions reductions can be in this case done mostly through renewable electricity purchases;\n\n- \u25a0 62 large hydrogen production units (SMR), which use combustion processes emitting CO2 based on natural gas consumption; such emissions are classified as direct emissions (scope 1). The reduction of CO2 emissions is done by using Group's proprietary technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS).\n\nAir Liquide carries out a complete inventory of its greenhouse gas emissions, which are reported according to the different categories  recommended by recognized standards such as the GreenHouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. The following schema represents the CO2 emissions of the Group:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe data presented have been rounded up to the tenth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Emissions are reported in million tonnes of CO2-equivalent using 'marketbased' methodology\n\nThus, in  2022,  the Group's  direct  reported emissions (scope 1) and indirect reported emissions (scope 2) amount respectively to 16.3 million tonnes and 23 million tonnes in CO2-equivalent.\n\n<!-- image -->",

GROUP'S CLIMATE OBJECTIVES\n\nAir Liquide acknowledges the importance and urgency of climate issues. The Group intends to play an active role in achieving the targets set  out in the Paris Agreement, which defines a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2\u00b0C compared with the pre-industrial level, and by continuing efforts to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nIn this regard, the Group has committed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Two major intermediate milestones support this long-term objective:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 followed by a -33% reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions in 2035 compared with a 2020 baseline (1) .\n\nMoreover, the Group has maintained the objective set in 2018 to reduce its carbon intensity by -30% by 2025 compared with 2015 (2) .\n\n## 31.4.  TRANSITION RISK - GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS\n\nThe main climate risk identified by the Group at the 2022 closing period relates to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe climate transition risk (greenhouse gas emissions) is closely linked to the access to renewable electricity sources and implementation by public authorities of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies such as, for example, the introduction of a carbon price or more stringent product regulations, that may impact:\n\n- \u25a0 either the Group's plants (direct impact on the operational scope), resulting in increased production costs, which by contract would be transferred to the customers, and the need for new investments;\n- \u25a0 or those of its suppliers, resulting in suppliers price increases;\n- \u25a0 or customers (indirect impact on the value chain), impacting for instance their market, processes and industrial gases needs.\n\n## The following governance and actions have been implemented to limit the risk on the Group's assets:\n\n- \u25a0 For  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  those  without  a current price for CO2,  Air  Liquide includes in its investment decision  process  a  carbon price  of 50  euros  per  tonne, the local current price and a high value of 100 euros or more per tonne, chosen in function of the geography and context. The Group makes sure that with the price the project is still viable for the customer. As a reminder, any CO2 cost is contractually passed through to the customer, significantly reducing any impairment risk on the related asset.\n- \u25a0 In cases where the public carbon price exceeds a certain cap, contracts with some customers contemplate additional investment  to  decarbonize the  facility  (for example  by using carbon capture and storage solutions -CCS) and the corresponding additional revenue for the Group.\n- \u25a0 The Group's electricity procurement initiatives have been reinforced, in particular the procurement of renewable electricity, in order to reduce the scope 2 emissions figures.\n- \u25a0 The trajectory  of  the  climate objectives is centrally  managed via a carbon budget allocated to the regions which is revisited every year, in line with intermediary objectives. This trajectory is monitored by the Environment and Society Committee of the Board of Directors, which also meets once a year, in joint sessions with the Audit and Accounts Committee. During this joint session, the two Committees may review the trajectory of climate objectives. The implementation of these climate objectives  is  part of the  criteria  for  the Long Term Incentive plans for the CEO and for more than 2000 beneficiaries.\n\n## Air Liquide's actions to limit transition risk impacts include:\n\n## Scope 2 reduction:\n\n- \u25a0 Related to the 424 large air gas  production units or ASUs, (scope 2 emissions) mainly by using renewable electricity: the deployment of the Group's actions in the 10 countries with the greatest potential will significantly reduce scope 2 emissions. Since 2018, Air Liquide has already signed 13 renewable energy  supply contracts  for an  estimated annual  quantity  of 1.724 GWh/y (in a full year after start-up of renewable production units). As the ASUs are almost all electrified, they do not require any specific investment for the transition, because emission reduction will be managed through renewable energy purchase.\n- \u25a0 Energy costs, including renewable  energy costs do not represent any financial risk as they are 100% passedthrough to the customer according to the terms of the 15 years or more contracts.\n\n## Scope 1 reduction:\n\n- \u25a0 Related  to  the  62  large  hydrogen  production  units  or  SMRs, (scope 1 emissions), by capturing CO2. Air Liquide masters a complete portfolio of proprietary technologies for capturing CO2. Thus, advanced Cryocap\u2122 CO2 capture technology equipment has  been in industrial  operation  since  2015  on  a hydrogen production  unit  in  France.  The  Group  was recently selected for financing via European subventions for two carbon capture projects on SMRs. Thus, the decarbonization of the Group's 10 largest SMRs will reduce scope 1 emissions by more than 40%. No dismantling of existing SMRs before the end of the contract is necessary to achieve the Group's climate objectives .\n- \u25a0 The innovation capacity and technological know-how of Air Liquide's  teams enable  the Group to offer cleaner and  more sustainable solutions to reduce its own emissions and those of its  industrial  customers. The Group  focuses on technologies for climate solutions and energy transition. In 2022, Air Liquide had more than 350 patent families on hydrogen.The Group's Innovation expenses amounted to 308 million euros in 2022, including more than 100 million dedicated to climate solutions.",

        "page_content": "- \u25a0 The demand for low-carbon industrial gas at a higher price is growing and makes it possible to remunerate the investment necessary for the decarbonization of Air Liquide's assets , in particular for the  production of hydrogen, as well as any additional costs linked to the supply of renewable electricity. In addition, financing programs in the  form of subsidies  or  tax credits are also implemented in Europe and more recently in the United States in order to support, during a transition period, the  decarbonization of existing industrial assets and new units of production. Therefore, there is no indication of impairment for the related assets .\n- \u25a0 Costs related to CO2 emissions (ex ETS scheme in Europe) a re 100% passed-through to the customer according to the terms of the 15 years or more contracts. The Group also applies this business model to the supply of low carbon industrial  gas,  therefore Air Liquide does not bear the risk associated with energy and CO2 costs.\n\nThe potential impacts of transition risk have been analyzed in the context of the 2022 Group's Financial Statements closing, based on the above mentioned facts and assumptions. No significant impact has been identified, either on the useful life or on the value  of the assets,  on the  client portfolio  or on  the cash flows generated by existing activities or  on provisions for risks and charges.\n\n## 31.5.  PHYSICAL RISKS\n\nAir Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the world  exposed  to changes (in amplitude or frequency) in exceptional meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down or interrupt the Group's operations or make them more expensive. Its  suppliers  and  customers are  also  confronted  with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which are increasing: storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the US Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to more long-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in their variability, the disappearance of certain resources, etc.\n\nAir Liquide's actions to limit physical impacts include:\n\n- \u25a0 Physical risks (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.)  are  appraised during the review of investment requests, in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example in the design of equipment.\n- \u25a0 Group  operations which are regularly exposed  to the acute risks described above have risk management systems in place aimed at adopting  suitable preventive  operational  measures, and at managing these crises by, first and foremost, protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n- \u25a0 Chronic risks are taken into account, in particular in the design of production units, in the same way and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n- \u25a0 Losses caused by natural disasters are covered by the Group property and business interruption program.\n- \u25a0 The potential impacts on the 2022 Group's Financial Statements of the physical risks has been studied. No significant impact has been identified, either on the useful life or on the value of the assets, on the client portfolio or on the cash flows generated by existing activities or on provisions for risks and charges.\n\nTo be noted for both transition risks and physical risks, there is no impact on the dismantling provision, as this is an obligation already presented and provisioned from the date  of the Large Industries contract signature.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This Statutory  Auditors'  report  includes  information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the Statutory Auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the Management Report and other documents provided to shareholders.\n\nThis report should be  read in  conjunction with,  and construed in accordance with, French law  and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of L' Air Liquide,\n\n## OPINION\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Air Liquide ('the Group') for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit and Accounts Committee.\n\n## BASIS FOR OPINION\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment,  were of  most significance in our audit  of  the consolidated  financial  statements  of  the current period,  as  well  as  how  we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: qualification of the contracts and related revenue recognition method\n\n## Risk identified\n\nThe gas supply of the Large Industries  activity is based on long term  contracts with a limited  number of customers and requires significant industrial investments.\n\nAs  described  in note  '3.a.  Revenue  recognition -  Gas  &  Services'  of the  accounting  principles section of the  consolidated  financial statements, these investments are usually made to share production capacity with the other business lines of the Group, particularly the Industrial Merchant business or to serve customers connected to pipelines in an industrial region. In such cases, Group management considers that those assets are not identified as defined in the standard IFRS 16 'Leases'.\n\nWhen assets used for the long term supply agreements are dedicated to a customer, the Group considers that it retains the right to direct the use of these  assets as defined in the standard IFRS 16.  Accordingly, gas supply agreements linked to those assets are not considered  as leases.  These  industrial  investments  continue  to  be  controlled by  the Group and  are  recorded  as  property,  plant  and equipment, the full amounts received for the contracts being, otherwise, recognized as revenue.\n\nCustomers of the Large Industries business simultaneously receive and consume the benefits granted by the gas supply service or its availability. As a result, the revenue recognition related to these contracts occurs when the gas is supplied or when the reserved capacity is made available.\n\nAs described in note 31 \"Climate risk consideration\" to the consolidated financial statements, long term gas supply contracts include guaranteed minimum volumes through take-or-pay clauses, as well as the indexation to variable costs (mainly electricity and natural gas), including any CO2 cost, and inflation.\n\nDue to the complexity of those contracts and the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements of the judgments made when the contract is signed or in case of subsequent significant modifications, and of the execution of contractual clauses such as indexation",

Revenue recognition -  Gas Services' of  the accounting principles section of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Large Industries activity: useful lives of production units and measurement of their recoverable amount\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the net book value of property, plant and equipment amounts to 23, 647 million euros, or 47,8% of the Group total assets, that include the significant industrial investments to execute the customer agreements of the Large Industries activity. As disclosed in note '5.e. Property, plant and equipment' of the accounting principles section of the consolidated financial statements, Large Industries production units are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, usually 15 to 20 years. The estimated useful lives are reassessed on a regular basis and the resulting change in estimates, if any, are recorded on a prospective basis.\n\nIn addition, the  Group can be  exposed  to  certain  risks  specific to industrial investments.  Expected  returns  on investment  and their recoverable value can, for example, be adversely impacted by events such as the economic context, overruns and construction delays, start-up conditions, technology changes, geographical location, counterparty risk or the need for new investments in order to meet an increasing demand for low-carbon industrial gases. New investments may also be required to meet the Group objectives and commitments to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  note  '5.f.  Impairment  of  assets'  of  the  accounting  principles section  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  Group management determines on a regular basis whether asset impairment indicators exist. If a triggering event is identified, an impairment test is performed to confirm whether the net book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable value. These principles lead the Group to test production assets (either individually or within the cash generating unit to which they are attached), in particular in case of significant start-up delays, project  termination, significant decrease in expected  business volumes, early  termination or  non-renewal of  related customer contracts, obsolescence of assets in the context of the energy transition.\n\nThe measurement of the recoverable value of the equipment relies on significant estimates relating to the Group's capacity to generate future  cash-flows, re-use  certain  equipment  for  other  internal or  external  customers,  to  sell the  assets,  or to  obtain indemnification, notably from customers, or subsidies\n\nDue to the significant value of each production asset and the cumulative value of these assets, the key assumptions used to assess their useful life, their re-use or the compensation to be received, we have considered the useful life and measurement of the recoverable value of Large Industries production assets as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 understanding the procedures performed by the Group to assess and update the depreciation period of the equipment;\n- \u25a0 assessing the consistency of their useful lives with contractual terms and available internal technical studies;\n- \u25a0 analyzing the Group's process to identify impairment indicators;\n- \u25a0 understanding the work carried out by the Group to determine the recoverable values of the plants, including key assumptions and estimates used to determine the future cash flows;\n- \u25a0 assessing the accounting translation of impairment losses resulting from the determination of recoverable values;\n- \u25a0 assessing,  with  the assistance  of  our experts in  climate change and  energy  transition, the  impact  of  climate change and  energy transition on the financial statements, in order to corroborate the Group's assessment that its climate strategy has not resulted in any material impact, neither on the useful life nor on the recoverable value of Large Industries production assets;\n- \u25a0 assessing the absence of obvious inconsistencies between the consolidated financial statements and the Group's other publications addressing the issues related to climate change (Management report, the Universal Registration Document);\n- \u25a0 verifying  the  appropriateness of the  disclosure  included  in  note  '5.e.  Property,  plant and equipment' and note '5.f.  Impairment of assets' of the accounting principles section of the consolidated financial statements and note 31 'Climate risk consideration\" to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impairment test of goodwill\n\n## Risk identified\n\nIn connection with its external growth strategy, the Group monitors the related goodwill at the level of group of cash generating units. For the Gas & Services activity, goodwill are mostly allocated on a geographical basis. For the world business units Engineering & Construction and Global Markets & Technologies, goodwill is monitored at the business unit level. As at December 31, 2022, goodwill amounts to a net book value of 14,587 million euros (29,5% of the Group total assets).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insofar as the fair value is not significantly greater than the net carrying amount of the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units, the Group confirms the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit  or  group  of  cash-generating  units  using the  estimated  cash  flow approach (value in  use)  as described  in note '5.f. Impairment of assets' of the accounting principles section of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe determination of fair value  and  recoverable value, and  the sensitivity to the fluctuation  of market  multiples and key data and assumptions used, require significant judgement and management estimates, in particular in the context of climate change and energy transition. We have therefore considered the impairment test of goodwill as a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures consisted notably in:\n\n- \u25a0 understanding and assessing the principles used to determine the groups of cash generating units;\n- \u25a0 analyzing, with the assistance of our valuation experts, principles and methods used to determine the market value and their measurement based on multiples of market capitalization;\n- \u25a0 corroborate, on the basis of external data:\n- -the results of the Group's impairment tests as of December 31, 2022, and\n- -the consideration of both climate risk and challenges and opportunities relating to the energy transition;\n- \u25a0 assessing the sensitivity of the result of the impairment tests performed by the Group as at December 31, 2022;\n- \u25a0 assessing the appropriateness of the information included in note '10. Goodwill' to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the Group's Management report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the  consolidated non-financial statement required  by  Article  L.225-102-1  of the  French  Commercial Code  (Code  de commerce)  is included  in  the Group's information given  in the Management report,  being specified  that,  in  accordance  with  Article L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and the information  has to be subject to a report by an independent third party.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of the presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  the  annual  financial  report  mentioned in Article  L.  451-1-2,  I  of  the French  Monetary  and Financial  Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared  under the  responsibility of the  Chief Executive  Officer (Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral), complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging of these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent to the block-tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to the European single electronic format, the content of certain tags of the notes may not be rendered identically to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of L'Air Liquide by the Annual General Meeting held on May 12, 2016 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on May 4, 2022 for KPMG S.A.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in its seventh year of uninterrupted engagement and KPMG S.A.in its first year.\n\n## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  and  for such internal  control  as  management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Accounts Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors",

        "page_content": "## STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is  not  a  guarantee  that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies  and  assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25a0 obtains  an understanding of internal control relevant  to  the audit  in order  to  design  audit  procedures  that are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u25a0 assesses the  appropriateness  of  management's use of the  going concern basis  of  accounting and,  based  on  the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u25a0 evaluates  the overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u25a0 obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance  of  the audit  of the  consolidated  financial statements  and  for the  opinion  expressed on  these consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit and Accounts Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Accounts Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide  the  Audit and Accounts Committee  with the declaration  provided for in  Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee   the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 1 st , 2023 The Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nKPMG S.A\n\nOlivier Lotz\n\nC\u00e9dric Le Gal\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\nLaurent Genin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n<!-- image -->",

General principles\n\nThe statutory accounts  of  the Company L'Air  Liquide S.A. have been prepared in accordance with the accounting rules and principles generally accepted in France according to the provisions of the French Chart of Accounts (Plan Comptable G\u00e9n\u00e9ral) .\n\nThe accounting policies for the establishment and presentation of the statutory accounts have been applied in accordance with the principle of prudence and with the following basic assumptions:\n\n- \u25a0 Going concern;\n- \u25a0 Consistency of accounting methods from one accounting period to another;\n- \u25a0 Separation of each accounting periods.\n\nThe method used for the valuation of recorded items is the historical cost method.\n\nOnly material information is disclosed.\n\n## 2. Non-current assets\n\n## A.  Intangible assets\n\nInternally generated intangible assets primarily include the development costs of information management systems. They are capitalized only if they generate probable future economic benefits and whether there is available appropriate resources (technical, financial and others) to complete the development and use or sell the intangible asset. Internal and external costs corresponding to detailed application design, programming, the performance of tests and the drafting of technical documentation intended for internal or external use are capitalized.\n\nSignificant upgrade and improvement costs are added to the initial cost of assets if they specifically meet the capitalization criteria.\n\nOther intangible assets include separately acquired intangible assets such as software, licenses and intellectual property rights and are measured at acquisition cost.\n\nIntangible assets are amortized according to the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.\n\n## B.  Tangible assets\n\nLand, buildings and equipment are recognized at historical cost. Interim interest expense is not included in the cost.\n\nWhere components of a tangible asset have different useful lives, they are  accounted  separately  and  depreciated over their  own useful lives.\n\nDepreciation is computed according  to the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 buildings: 10 to 30 years;\n- \u25a0 equipment: 5 to 20 years.\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\n## C.  Impairment of intangible and tangible assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each closing date whether there is any indication of impairment loss of intangible and tangible assets. If such indications exist, an impairment test is performed to assess whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its present value, which is  defined as the greater  of its  market value and value in use.\n\nIn assessing  value in  use, the  estimated future cash flows  are discounted to their present  value as  this  would  be  done  for  an investment decision.\n\nWhen the present amount of an asset is lower than its net carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement. When the present value exceeds the carrying amount, the previously  recognized  impairment is  reversed  to  the income statement.\n\n## D.  Equity investments\n\nEquity investments are  recognized  at their  initial  amount  on  the entry date, with the exception of those subject to a revaluation as provided by Law 76-1232 of December 29, 1976. Acquisition costs that are not representative of market value are expensed.\n\nWhen the carrying amount, determined using the criteria normally adopted for the measurement of equity investments (market multiples method based on the Air Liquide Group market valuation, estimated cash flow approach, and net asset value remeasured at fair value), is lower than the book value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference.\n\n## E.  Treasury shares\n\nWhen the Company purchases its own shares, they are recognized at cost as treasury shares in other long-term investment securities. The gains or losses on disposals of treasury shares contribute to the net profit for the year.\n\nHowever, shares allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are reclassified to a 'Short-term financial investments - Company treasury shares' caption at the balance sheet value on the date of allotment.\n\nA provision is recorded over the rights vesting period to cover the future charge of employees and members of Executive Management of the Company relating to the remittance of current shares when the performance criteria can be determined with reliability. Conversely, the amount corresponding to the maximum performance level is presented in off-balance sheet commitments.\n\nWhen the purchase cost of shares is higher than their valuation based  on the  average share price  during  the last month of the fiscal year, treasury shares earmarked for cancellation or allocated for the purpose of implementing plans for free grants of shares are not impaired.\n\n## 3. Inventories and work-in-progress\n\nRaw materials, supplies and goods are primarily measured at weighted average cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for inventories and work-inprogress when the estimated realizable amount is lower than cost.\n\n## 4. Trade receivables and other operating assets\n\nTrade  receivables and  other operating  assets are measured  at historical cost.\n\nAn impairment loss for receivables is recognized when it becomes probable that the amount due will not be collected and the loss can be reasonably estimated.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date.\n\nAt year-end, the difference arising from the translation of receivables and payables denominated in a foreign currency, are recognized in suspense accounts in assets and liabilities ('Unrealized foreign currency gains or losses').\n\nWhere applicable, unrealized foreign exchange losses associated with non-hedged transactions are subject to a contingency provision.\n\n## 6. Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when:\n\n- \u25a0 the Company has a present obligation towards a third party as a result of a past event or an ongoing one;\n- \u25a0 it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation;\n- \u25a0 a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n## 7. Financial instruments\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A. applies the ANC regulation n\u00b0 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 related to financial forward and hedging instruments.\n\nIn accordance with its risk management policy, L'Air Liquide S.A. enters into forward currency purchases or sales in order to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with transactions carried out in foreign currencies.\n\nBy  symmetry,  the foreign  exchange gains or losses  on forward currency purchases or sales is presented at the same time and in the same income statement caption as the hedged item.\n\nLikewise, the unrealized gain from the hedging is presented within the unrealized foreign currency gains or losses statement caption, to offset  the exchange  differentials  related to the  revaluation  of underlying receivables and debts. When the forward currency purchases or sales, hedge future transactions not yet recorded on the balance sheet, the fair value of these instruments represents an off balance sheet commitment.\n\nWhere applicable, when the financial instruments used do not constitute hedging transactions ('isolated open position'), the losses resulting from their year-end market value are provided for in the income statement. In accordance with the principle of prudence, unrealized gains are not recognized in the income statement.\n\n## 8. Post-employment benefits\n\nThe Company applies the ANC  recommendation n\u00b0 2013-02  of November,7 2013 amended on November 5,  2021  (2 nd method) related to the recognition and measurement of retirement benefits and similar obligations\n\nThe Company provides its employees with various pension plans, termination benefits, jubilees (awards based on years of service) and  other post-employment benefits for  both active employees and retirees. These benefits are covered in two ways:\n\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined contribution plans;\n- \u25a0 by so-called defined benefit plans.\n\nThe Company grants both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.\n\nDefined contribution plans are plans under which the employer's sole obligation is to pay regular contributions. The employer does not grant any guarantee on the future level of benefits paid to the employee or retiree ('means-based obligation'). The annual\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Statutory accounts on the parent company\n\npension expense is equal to the contribution paid during the fiscal year which relieves the employer from any further obligation.\n\nDefined benefit plans are those by which the employer guarantees the future level of benefits defined in the agreement, most often depending on the employee's salary and seniority ('result-based obligation'). Defined benefit plans can be:\n\n- \u25a0 either financed by contributions to a fund specialized in managing the contributions paid;\n- \u25a0 or managed internally.\n\nIn the case of defined benefit plans, retirement and similar obligations are measured by independent actuaries, according to the projected unit credit method. The actuarial calculations mainly take into account the following assumptions: salary increases, employee turnover, retirement date, mortality, inflation and appropriate discount rates.\n\nActuarial  gains  and losses  exceeding  the  greater  of  10%  of  the obligations or 10% of the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the reporting period are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants.\n\nIn accordance with  article L.123-13 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), the Company maintained its previous practices:  obligations  related  to  retirement  termination  payments and jubilees are provided whereas other  retirement obligations related to defined benefit plans are not provided but are disclosed in the notes.\n\n## 9. Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.\n\nRevenue associated with delivery of services is booked when delivery is completed.\n\n## 10. Tax consolidation\n\nL'Air  Liquide  S.A. has set up a tax consolidation  group with  the French subsidiaries in  which  it  holds  a  direct  or  indirect  interest exceeding 95%,  as  defined by article  223-A of the French Tax Code.\n\nEach company calculates its tax provision as if it was taxed separately. L'Air Liquide S.A., as head of  the tax consolidation group, recognizes as an expense the tax corresponding to its own profits and recognizes in a balance sheet current tax account the impact of restatements and eliminations when determining taxable profit as a whole and the tax deferrals of subsidiaries with losses. It is booked in exceptional income and expenses according to the Opinion 2005-G of the Emergency Committee of the C.N.C.\n\n## 11. Research and Development expenditures\n\nDevelopment costs shall be recognized as assets if and only if the Company can demonstrate all of the following:\n\n- \u25a0 the project is clearly identified and the related costs are individualized and reliably monitored;\n- \u25a0 the technical and industrial feasibility of the project is demonstrated;\n- \u25a0 there is a clear intention to complete the project and use or sell the products arising from it;\n- \u25a0 it is probable  that the project will generate future  economic benefits for the Company.\n\nWhen these conditions are not satisfied, the work carried out does not systematically result in the completion of an intangible asset that will be available for use or sale, development costs generated are recognized as an expense when incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Additional paid-in capital was reduced by the amount of premiums related to these shares, i.e. -152.8 million euros;\n- -capital increase of 269.0 million euros, noted by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as delegated by the Board of Directors on May 4, 2022, resulting from the granting of one free share for 10 existing shares (creation of 47,547,083 new shares) and one free share for 100 existing shares as part of a 10% bonus allotment (creation of 1,358,416 new shares) by deducting -269.0 million euros from 'Additional paid-in-capital'; The Additional paid-in capital was reduced by the capital increase costs, i.e. -1.6 million euros;\n- -capital increases of 1.9 million euros resulting from the exercise of 179,795 subscription options before the free share attribution and 172,840 subscription options after the free share attribution. The Additional paid-in capital was increased by the premiums related to these share capital increases, i.e. 23.2 million euros.\n- (c) The change in Retained earnings also includes the difference between the estimated loyalty dividend and the loyalty dividend actually paid and the cancellation of the dividend pertaining to treasury shares.\n- (d) The change in the Accelerated depreciation results from the new accelerated depreciation in accordance with asset depreciation and amortization policies.\n\n## 14.

There is therefore no isolated open position whose change in fair value would have a direct impact on the income statement.\n\n## 16. Retirement and similar plans\n\n## A.  Group retirement benefit guarantee agreement\n\nIn France, Air Liquide grants additional benefits to retirees (3,206 retirees as of December 31, 2022). These benefits provide a supplemental retirement income based on final pay, which is paid in addition to other normal retirement benefits. This plan is closed to employees  under the  age  45, or with  less than 20  years of service as  of January 1,  1996.  These  plans  are  unfunded.  The annual amount paid with regards to additional benefits cannot exceed originally  12%  of  total  payroll  or,  in  some  case,  12%  of pre-tax profits of companies involved. This 12% threshold will be proportionately reduced by comparing the number of plan beneficiaries for the year to the number of plan beneficiaries for the previous year. The additional benefit granted by Air Liquide is indexed to the pension revaluation rates of normal and supplemental retirement benefits up to a certain annuity threshold without any indexation beyond. This additional benefit was funded subsequently  to the article  50 of the  law of January  20, 2014 securing the future and fairness of pensions plans.\n\nThe contributions amounted to 19.2 million euros after reinvoicing subsidiaries (21.8 million euros in 2021). Excluding the impact of timelines, and until the plan ends, the actuarial value of obligations vis-\u00e0-vis retirees and those eligible as of December 31, 2022 amounts to 393.8 million euros.\n\nBased on the assumptions used for the valuation of the retirement obligations, an estimated 199.9 million euros will be recharged to the subsidiaries of L'Air Liquide  S.A. as and  when  benefits  are paid to the retirees.\n\n## B.  Externally funded plan\n\nL'Air Liquide S.A. grants to employees not covered by the preceding plan (1,074 employees as of December 31, 2022) and with  at  least  one half-year of service  benefit  from  an  externally funded defined contribution plan. Contributions  to this plan are jointly  paid  by  the employer and employee. For 2022, employer contributions  amounted to 8.4 million euros (8.1 million  euros  in 2021).\n\n## C.  Retirement termination payments and jubilees\n\nThe corresponding obligations are provided for in the amount of 29.0 million euros (net of tax) and 1.0 million euros, respectively.\n\n## D.  Calculation of actuarial assumptions and methods\n\nThe calculations with  respect to  the Group's retirement benefit guarantee agreement, retirement termination payments and jubilees are performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial  gains  and losses  exceeding  the  greater  of  10%  of  the obligations related to retirement termination payments and unrecognized past service costs are amortized over the expected average working lives of the plan participants. As of December 31, 2022, the amounts stand at -5.7 million euros (15.8 million euros in 2021).\n\nThe actuarial assumptions (turnover, mortality, retirement age, salary increase) vary according to demographic and economic conditions.\n\nThe discount rates used to determine the present value of obligations are based on Government bonds or High-quality Corporate bonds, with the same duration as the obligations at the valuation date (3.75 % as of December 31, 2022).\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in  compliance  with  the  independence  requirements of the  French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de Commissaire aux comptes) for  the  period  from  January  1 st ,  2022  to  the  date  of  our  report, and specifically  we  did  not  provide  any prohibited  non -audit  services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS - KEY AUDIT MATTERS\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we  inform you  of the  key  audit matters relating  to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional  judgment,  were of most significance in our audit  of the  financial statements  of the  current  period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the Financial Statements.\n\n## Equity investments measurement\n\n## Risk identified\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the net book value of the equity investments amounts to 12,419.3 million euros and represents 86,9% of the total balance sheet. Equity investments are recognized at their initial consideration, excluding acquisition costs and after considering legal reevaluation if any (as provided by Law 76-1232 of December 29, 1976).\n\nAs disclosed in note '2.D. Accounting policies - Equity investments' to the  statutory Financial Statements, when  the carrying amount (determined applying the market  multiples method based on the Group market capitalization or the estimated cash flows method or the  method of  net  asset  value  re-measured  at  fair value)  is  lower than  the net  book value of  the equity  investment, an  impairment loss is recognized for the difference\n\nThe selection of the method used to determine the carrying amount requires significant judgement of the Company.\n\nDue to the significant equity investments balance and the impact of the method retained to determine the  carrying amount, we have considered  that the  measurement  of  the equity  investments  as  a key audit matter.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur procedures mainly consisted in considering, based on information provided by the Company, the valuation methods applied by the Company, and assessing;\n\n- \u25a0 the assumptions used to determine the re-measured net asset;\n- \u25a0 the methodology and the results of the tests performed based on the Group market capitalization;\n- \u25a0 the appropriateness  of  information  included in  notes '2.D. Accounting policies -Equity investments', '10. Financial assets' and '11. Impairment, allowances and provisions' to the Statutory Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## STATUTORY AUDITORS' RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the Financial Statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823 -10 -1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u25a0 identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25a0 obtains  an understanding of internal control relevant  to  the audit  in order  to design  audit procedures  that are  appropriate  in  the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the Financial Statements;\n- \u25a0 assesses the  appropriateness  of  Management's use of the  going concern basis  of  accounting and,  based  on  the  audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material  uncertainty exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw attention  in  the audit  report  to  the  related  disclosures  in  the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- \u25a0 evaluates the  overall presentation  of  the Financial Statements and  assesses  whether these  statements represent  the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## REPORT TO THE AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS COMMITTEE\n\nWe submit to the Audit and Accounts Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report significant deficiencies, if any, in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Accounts Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also  provide the Audit  and Accounts Committee  with  the declaration provided  for in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU) No.  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France as set out in particular in Articles L. 822 -10 to L. 822 -14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de Commissaire aux comptes). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Accounts Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine et Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 1 st , 2023 The Statutory Auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nKPMG S.A.\n\nOlivier Lotz\n\nC\u00e9dric Le Gal\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson\n\nLaurent Genin\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following  this,  in  March  2021, Air  Liquide  set  itself the  ambition to achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  2050 and two major milestones: a -33% reduction of its CO2 (2) emissions in absolute value by 2035 versus 2020 (3) and an inflection point in emissions around 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAir Liquide's objective to reduce its Scopes 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2035 has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in May 2022 as qualified and aligned with climate science (4) . The Group was the first in its industry to obtain validation from the SBTi.\n\nAir Liquide intends to contribute to carbon neutrality by addressing its entire value chain, covering direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions related to energy procurement (Scope 2), as well as the main indirect emissions of Scope 3.\n\nTo achieve the decarbonization of its assets, the Group has now set up processes to measure and control its CO2 emissions on a quarterly basis. Each geography of the Group has been allocated a yearly carbon budget and each new project is evaluated against the global trajectory of decarbonization.\n\nAir Liquide's strategy is based on the decarbonization of its own assets, as well as on a commitment throughout its value chain:\n\n- -upstream, by integrating the reduction of emissions into the purchasing process and supporting its suppliers,\n- -downstream, by developing innovative  low-carbon  solutions  with its  customers  to  offer low-carbon solutions and co-developing processes like oxy-combustion and CO2 capture.\n\nOverall, the Group contributes to the emergence of a low-carbon society by promoting hydrogen, by developing clean mobility, and by enabling the circular economy with use of biomethane.\n\n## SCOPE 3 COMMITMENT\n\nAware of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its 'Scope 3' emissions reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to make a pledge that 75% of its 50 largest customers will have a stated carbon neutrality commitment by 2025 and 100% by 2035.\n\nIn 2022, the Group's Scopes 1 and 2 emissions remained stable for the second year in a row, while activity is growing strongly again.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In mature economies, the Group improves the quality of life of patients with chronic diseases at home, 49% of them having personalized support plans by the end of 2022, a 11% improvement compared to the year before. In low-and-middle-income countries, Air Liquide facilitates access to oxygen to 1,778,000 people.\n\n## \u25a0 Act as a trusted partner.\n\nAir Liquide strives to  act  as  a trusted  partner with  all its  stakeholders:  employees, customers,  suppliers,  shareholders  and local communities.\n\nAir Liquide is  promoting  inclusive  culture  and diversity. In 2022,  the Group has  reached a  share  of  31.5% (5) of women among Managers and Professionals with an objective of 35% by 2025.\n\nThe Group is committed to providing 100% of its employees with a common basis care of coverage, including death and disability insurance, healthcare and paid maternity leave by 2025. In 2022 the population covered is 42% of employees, an improvement of 8% vs. last year.\n\nAir Liquide supports local social initiatives, with Citizen at Work program. 43% of employees had access to volunteering opportunities in 2022, with the objective of providing such access to its 100% of employees by 2025.\n\n## Other environmental objectives\n\nDecarbonizing the planet is a strategic pillar for the Group. On a broader level, Air Liquide is responsible for preserving the environment, particularly water resources and biodiversity.\n\nIn 2022, due to the development of the activity, and in particular the takeover of Sasol's production units, the Group's water consumption increased by 10%.\n\nAir Liquide published its policy and objectives regarding water management in 2021 and began its deployment in 2022 (see paragraph 2.3 Water management in the section 2 Environmental stakes of this chapter, page 368).\n\n## COMMITMENTS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY\n\nAfter an in-depth analysis of the impacts and dependencies of its products and supply chain on biodiversity, Air Liquide has formalized a more detailed framework in 2022, which led it to make its first commitments to preserving biodiversity (see paragraph 2.4 Biodiversity in the section 2 Environmental stakes of this chapter, page 371).\n\n## Legal framework\n\nThis Universal Registration Document strives to comply with the various principles that respectively govern the (EU) Regulation 2017/1129 of June 14, 2017 ('Prospectus III Regulation'), the Vigilance Plan and the Extra-financial Performance Declaration (EFPD) as follows:\n\nChapter 1 sets out the Group's integrated strategy, its business model, and its financial, environmental and societal performance.\n\n## Chapter 2 includes:\n\n- \u25a0 a description of risk factors that are material and specific to the issuer and associated management measures, covered in article 16 of the Prospectus III Regulation;\n- \u25a0 the  mapping  of risks  specific  to  the  duty  of  vigilance (as  defined  by the  article  L.  225-102-4  of  the  French  commercial  code) supplements the  Company's own mapping, identifying risks  that the Company could pose to individuals (concerning respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, health and safety) and to the environment. The most serious risks are identified so that they can be addressed as a priority by implementing preventive, mitigating or remedial measures (page 95).\n\nThe Extra-financial Performance Declaration (EFPD), as defined in article L. 22-10-36 paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code and published in Chapter 5 , sets out the main extra-financial risks for the Group and the associated mitigating policies. Some of these risks  fall  within  the  requirements  of  the Prospectus  III  Regulation  and are  included  in  the Risk Factors  and Management Measures section of Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nJust like the Annual Financial Report, the Environmental and Societal reporting is reviewed each year by an independent verifier. Audits by independent verifier conducted in 2022 covered 30% of the workforce and 24% of the Group's environmental footprint (6) .\n\nFor further information, the Group's website has a section dedicated to Sustainable Development.\n\nVisit https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/act-sustainable-future.",

Some of  these  risks  also relate to criteria in the Prospectus III regulation, and as such are presented in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document;\n- \u25a0 the policies and procedures implemented to prevent and mitigate these risks (Chapter 5);\n- \u25a0 the  results of  these policies  and  key performance  indicators (Chapter 5).\n\nIt is structured around corporate, environmental and social stakes.\n\nIn the Extra-financial Performance Declaration, the main risks and stakes were identified by the Sustainable Development Department in partnership with the Legal, Financial, Human Resources and Risks departments. Some of them appear in the Group's overall risks map and have been reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nMoreover, in  identifying these  risks and  stakes, Air Liquide  also takes into account a dual materiality perspective:\n\n- \u25a0 their internal impact, i.e. on the Group's performance and development;\n- \u25a0 their external impact taking into account the assessment of its stakeholders.\n\nIn order to integrate the main risks and opportunities into Group's strategy, according to the importance given to them by the various stakeholders, Air Liquide updated the materiality matrix of its sustainable development stakes in 2020. The results of this process are presented in this chapter (page 395 and 396).\n\nThrough its business, commitment and environmental and social actions, Air Liquide contributes to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) introduced by the UN to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and guarantee prosperity for all by 2030. To illustrate this contribution, initiatives by the Group - described in the EFPD - are associated with the relevant SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AIR LIQUIDE PROTECTS LIFE AND ENVIRONMENT\n\nMany industrial and medical gas applications protect the environment on the sites of Group's customers, and life at the homes of Group's patients. These applications accounted for over 40% of Group revenue in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Social stakes\n\n## 1.1. HEALTH AND SAFETY\n\n## 1.1.1.  Health and safety risks\n\nHealth  and  safety  risks form  part  of  the  Group's  industrial risks (described in chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 78), which are associated with the various products, industrial processes and distribution methods in use. Air Liquide's various business lines involve more specific risks associated with products and processes, and how they are operated.\n\n## 1.1.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nSafety  is  an  integral  part  of Air Liquide's  operational  excellence and culture. The Group is committed to reducing the exposure of its employees, customers, subcontractors, suppliers and local communities to occupational and industrial risks effectively and in all circumstances. Commitment to safety is total, visible and accompanied by unshakable vigilance.\n\nPrevention, protection, early detection and rapid reaction to health and  safety  risks  are at the  heart of the  Group's concerns.  This commitment is reiterated in the General Statement of Air Liquide's Principles of Action. These Principles are shared with all entities and are available on the Group's website ( https:// www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics/groupsprinciples-action).\n\nEvery  subsidiary  is committed  to  achieving the  'zero  accidents' ambition, as well as the  objective of  continuously  improving its safety performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The safety of individuals\n\nSafety is  a  collective  commitment  and  the  responsibility  of  each individual.  Being  aware  of  dangers and risks,  applying  the  rules and taking care of others - all this contributes to reducing the risk of accidents and strengthening the Group's safety culture. Safety leadership  training  and on-the-job  training  courses  are  regularly organized. Air Liquide's managers encourage safety efforts, demonstrate this commitment on site and reward best practices.\n\nEach employee and contractor must be aware  of safety rules, follow  them and intervene each time there is a risk of unsafe behavior or conditions.\n\nThe Group has drawn up Life-Saving Rules. Everyone working for Air Liquide, whether an employee or subcontractor, must be aware of these rules, follow them and always intervene if there is a risk of  unsafe behavior or conditions. The interpretation and meaning of each rule is widely shared within the Group and with subcontractors. The Safety and  Industrial Systems Department provides  entities with  various  communication,  awareness-raising and training materials on vital safety rules. Given their importance, non-compliance with any of these rules by anyone working for Air Liquide can lead to a warning, or even penalties up to and including suspension. These vital safety rules are as follows:\n\n- 1. I do not work under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n- 2. I do not smoke outside the reserved areas.\n- 3. I wear the personal protective equipment (PPE) required for the task and the work area.\n- 4. I wear a portable detector in the required areas.\n- 5. I never enter a confined space without analyzing and managing the risk.\n- 6. I only intervene when the risks are identified and formalized.\n- 7. I apply lockout procedures before working on any equipment potentially containing energy.\n- 8. I do not deactivate an Important Safety Component (ISC) without applying downgraded mode or compensatory measures.\n- 9. I wear fall-prevention equipment when required.\n- 10. I do not pass under a suspended load.\n- 11. I secure vehicle loading.\n- 12. I always wear my seat belt when I am in a moving vehicle.",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nAir Liquide uses contractors within the course of its business and pays particular attention to the following:\n\n- \u25a0 assessing the level of maturity and performance of safety measures before any sales commitment is made;\n- \u25a0 including safety clauses in the contracts;\n- \u25a0 a work structure with shared, comprehensible and detailed safety instructions;\n- \u25a0 communicating Air  Liquide's  safety  values  and standards,  as well as the regulations in force that must be followed;\n- \u25a0 being as demanding and stringent with contractors as we are with Group employees;\n- \u25a0 supervising contractors' safety in the execution of services;\n- \u25a0 safety reviews once the work is complete and sharing feedback.\n\n## Process safety\n\nProcess safety addresses risks relating to industrial facilities from production to product implementation. It draws on Air Liquide's Industrial Management System (IMS) and requires:\n\n- \u25a0 the identification of specific industrial risks for each business;\n- \u25a0 knowledge of scenarios and their potential consequences;\n- \u25a0 the implementation of appropriate preventive and protective safety measures for each of these risks;\n- \u25a0 the monitoring and analysis of risks relating to new technologies and events arising within the profession;\n- \u25a0 feedback to facilitate learning, awareness-raising, the promotion of a safety culture and to improve prevention.\n\nSince its implementation in 2005, the IMS has significantly changed and improved the way in  which industrial  activities  are managed. Thanks to employees' commitment to safety, environmental  protection and reliability,  this  system helps  strive towards operational excellence. Its implementation is regularly assessed by specific IMS internal audits.\n\nThe safety of industrial processes is a complex issue as, although rare, incidents can lead to very serious consequences with multiple fatalities. In order to ensure that operations efficiently take this risk into account, Air Liquide has introduced specific action plans, the purpose of which is to control the most serious risks  relating  to  industrial  processes.  They  have been  assigned the necessary resources (expertise and budgets) and follow a roadmap.\n\nThe progress of specific action plans aimed at bringing the most serious risks related to industrial processes under control is regularly monitored by the Group's Executive Management.\n\n## Road safety\n\nEach year, delivery vehicles, sales staff  and technicians travel hundreds of millions of kilometers. Non-compliance with the traffic regulations or the lack of regular maintenance of vehicles would expose drivers and third parties to increased risks of accidents.\n\nThe Group's goal is  to permanently reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents, for its employees and subcontractors as well as for third parties.\n\nIt uses the following means to achieve these goals:\n\n- \u25a0 ensuring that the Group's safety rules are applied by all subsidiaries and service providers;\n- \u25a0 replacing the fleet with safer vehicles;\n- \u25a0 improving the safety of drivers and third parties by introducing the necessary behavioral changes through the implementation of digital alert and support technologies;\n- \u25a0 systematically incorporating feedback from the most serious events, and sharing best practices with all of Group's subsidiaries and partners;\n- \u25a0 monitoring the implementation and effectiveness of measures implemented by subsidiaries through dedicated audits.\n\nAccording to the geographies, context, current legislation and practices, all or some of the following measures are applied:\n\n- \u25a0 the installation of onboard technologies such as cameras, which can detect driver  fatigue  and  distractions,  or  reversing cameras to reduce blind spots, in order to help change driver behavior or provide visibility of the vehicle's surroundings;\n- \u25a0 increased dialog on road safety both internally as well as with service  providers  and other  organizations  specialized in this subject, both locally and on an international scale. Air Liquide regularly holds transport safety discussions and knowledgebuilding events with its partners;\n- \u25a0 initiatives which lead to a change in behavior to implement a dynamic culture of road safety among Air Liquide employees and employees of the Group's contractors.\n\n## 1.1.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 'Good health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\nThe  lost-time  accident frequency  rate  for Air  Liquide  employees and temporary workers decreased to 0.9 at the end of 2022, compared to 1.1 at the end of 2021. Continued implementation of awareness and prevention actions will further improve safety and significantly and sustainable reduce this lost time accident frequency rate.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  recorded  the death of  one subcontractor  on road. The Group has made and will continue to make every effort to analyze all accidents that have occurred in order to learn from them and thus prevent them from happening again.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, several accidents involving an Air Liquide vehicle, some of which could have been avoided, unfortunately resulted in the death of a third party.\n\nAn analysis of road accidents in recent years has revealed a number of recurring causes, such as fatigue or distraction while driving. For this reason, Air Liquide has launched some key initiatives to support changes in driver behavior and promote the use of digital driver-assistance technologies, which will gradually lead to improvements in road transport safety.\n\n## 1.2. HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT\n\n## 1.2.1.  Human Resources management related risks\n\nHuman Resources management related risks are part of the Group's business related risks (described in  chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 81). Working arrangements in an international group like Air Liquide need to be able to adapt to a constantly changing world so that employees can operate in a safe, high-quality working environment and contribute to the Group's sustainable growth.\n\nThe long-term performance of Air Liquide is driven, in particular, by the quality of its employees, their skills and their commitment.\n\nIn its businesses, the Group is therefore exposed to the risk of not being able to:\n\n- \u25a0 attract and maintain the required skills at the right time and in the  right  place, in  particular  in  emerging  countries  where  the Group is expanding its activities, or in regions where the employment market is strained;\n- \u25a0 develop these skills, in particular with the digitization of certain businesses.\n\nIn addition  to  risks  relating  to  skills  management, psycho-social risks may also affect the health and level of commitment of Group employees, in particular in the recent context where working from home has been rapidly implemented.\n\nLastly, although all  Air Liquide employees have social security coverage that complies with local regulations, there are still disparities between countries that could potentially create inequitable situations within the Group. Furthermore, local standards may not, in some cases, be enough to provide adequate and fair social protection for employees.",

Policy and procedures\n\nThe Group is committed to identify, attract and develop the necessary scientific, technical and digital skills required for its growth, the efficient working of its operations and innovation. The Human Resources policy defines the main rules, together with the roles and responsibilities of the different parties in their implementation, with respect to, among others:\n\n- \u25a0 acquisition  and  sustainability  of  the  necessary  skills. Training is provided under the Air Liquide University brand. It is part of a structured program and is managed by a specific learning management system (LMS: Learning Management System);\n- \u25a0 supporting employees in their personal development throughout their  career, particularly  with  a  centralized career and skills management tool (TMS: Talent Management System) and the communication of career advancement opportunities (TAS: Talent Acquisition System).\n- It  should be noted that Air Liquide has begun to transform its HR processes, including the implementation of the integrated Workday tool, which will take place by 2024. The implementation of the talent management tool is already underway in certain geographies;\n- \u25a0 changes in working methods within the Company. The organization of work must not only meet the demands and expectations of today's employees and the Company, but also those of tomorrow, while being based on the Group's fundamentals. The result of a co-creation bringing together more than 700 employees, the Group thus deployed in 2020 its  new  BeActEngage model, which allows  its employees  to develop in a safe, ethical and engaging environment to deliver sustainable performance;\n- \u25a0 measuring and recognizing  performance  and contributions  of all employees. In addition to employee remuneration and loyalty policies (regular capital increases reserved for employees), specific provisions aimed at promoting and sustaining certain skills, such as inventor and entrepreneur recognition programs, and the technical expertise development scheme (Technical Community  Leaders) in a  wide  range of fields such as industrial operations, industrial safety and, more recently, digital and IT since 2019.\n\nThe Group ensures the building of a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative  professional environment while  also safeguarding the health and well-being of employees in the workplace.\n\nThe growth in working from home has increased the use of digital tools to ensure business continuity. Within the context of changes to the Group's organizational models, which were accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, Air Liquide  launched a  global project in 2020 called 'Next Normal' to support this shift in the organization of work.\n\nWith this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a supervised remote working policy;\n\n## 2025 objective\n\n## 2022 results\n\nof employees with common basis of care coverage including death and disability benefits, health coverage and a minimum of 14 weeks of paid maternity leave.\n\n100%\n\nof employees with common basis of care coverage including death and disability benefits, health coverage and a minimum of 14 weeks of paid maternity leave.\n\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 careful consideration of interactions with customers and patients;\n- \u25a0 a new framework for Air Liquide's responsible travel policy.\n\nTo facilitate the deployment of the project, Air Liquide developed a reference  guide  in  2021.  First shared  with  managers,  the guide helps  the entities to  set  up  new  working  methods  based  on  the initial global experience. Working groups were then organized with employees in the entities to validate the commitments.\n\nIn order to strengthen well-being at work, focus groups have been set up aiming at promoting the work-life balance of employees to strengthen their occupational well-being. This approach meets employees' expectations on this subject.\n\nIn addition, the Group continued to roll out the common basis of care  coverage  for all  employees worldwide,  in accordance with local regulations and the minimum standards set by Air Liquide.\n\n- \u25a0 life insurance: an insurance with a compensation equivalent to one's year salary in the event of death;\n- \u25a0 medical coverage: coverage for hospital inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 maternity leave: minimum 14 weeks leave paid at 100%.\n\nThese practices were incorporated into principles that were jointly developed with European social partners. In 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This led to the creation of a charter based on principles of action linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life balance. The content of this charter facilitated the conclusion of company agreements with social partners in order to offer new services to employees.\n\n## 1.2.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 'Good health and well-being' and 8 'Decent work and economic growth'.\n\n## Common basis of care coverage\n\nAs part of the ADVANCE objectives announced in 2022, Air Liquide's ambition is to ACT FOR ALL by committing to its employees. For this purpose, the Group has renewed its commitment to offer common basic social coverage to all employees by 2025.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, entities were grouped by country so that gaps in their current coverage could be assessed and a plan devised to phase in upgrades by 2025 could be defined.\n\nIn 2022, the percentage of employees benefiting from this common basis of care coverage is  42%,  compared with 34% at the end of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n42%\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition, in  2022,  each hub consolidated a 2023-2025 roadmap to achieve the target set.\n\n## Citizen at Work\n\nIn this same context,  the Group launched  the Citizen at Work initiative  in 2022 to  enable  its  employees to  actively  serve  their local communities.\n\nFor many years and throughout the world, Air Liquide's employees have been involved in helping local communities, with the support of subsidiaries' management or the Foundation.\n\nTo encourage this even further, the Group has created the Citizen at Work program, with the aim of giving employees the means to act and increasing its collective impact. This initiative, launched as a pilot scheme in 2022, provides subsidiaries with a framework to enable employees to volunteer in their local community. It will be gradually rolled out across the  entire Group  to reach  100% of entities by  2025. At  the end of  2022,  43%  of  Group  employees already had access to this program. Each project identified as part\n\n## 2025 Objective\n\n## 2022 Results\n\nof employees with access to volunteer initiatives as part of the Citizen at Work program.\n\n## 100%\n\n## Employee training and engagement\n\nAs part of the BeActEngage - Trust and Grow program, the Group provides employees with the means to learn throughout their career. As a learning company, Air Liquide also encourages employees to pass on their knowledge and learn from each other, and peer-to-peer learning is an excellent opportunity to broaden their skills.\n\nAir Liquide University has reinforced its offer of online learning ('elearning') used by a large number of users (more than 60,200 in 2022) in a wide variety of fields (ethics, industrial safety, competition law, digital safety, management, etc.).\n\nFollowing the health crisis, the digital transformation of many business lines and increased training for employees, the Air Liquide University has once again launched two virtual events open to the entire Group, which revolve around six themes: Management & Leadership, Sales & Marketing, Operational Excellence, Innovation, Climate & Energy Transition and HR professionals. This has resulted in 4,230 employees logged in to over 220 online sessions: webinars, virtual classes and learning paths.  Those sessions are afterwords available  in the  Learning Management system and the University website.\n\nAir Liquide University has also organized for the first time a Learning Festival, a two-week long virtual event dedicated to peer-based learning. All sessions were led by internal Air Liquide facilitators.  The  120  internal  facilitators and  51  creators  of  minitutorials  passed  on  their knowledge to the  2,500  participants in more than 100 sessions and 45 micro-learning videos.\n\nThese events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group with participants from 72 countries and, secondly, revealed employees' creative and teaching abilities.\n\nIn 2019, the Group launched  a  program  to measure and track commitment, My Voice. This program aims to assess and improve the experience and well-being of employees within the Group. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Employee feedback is collected  each year  throughout  the  Group to better understand their expectations, identify and implement appropriate\n\nof employees with access to volunteer initiatives as part of the Citizen at Work program.\n\n43%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nactions and thus significantly improve their commitment. This level  of  attention  to the  employee  experience  is  a  key factor in attracting, retaining and developing employees. The response rate for the 2022 commitment survey was 77%, compared to 83% in 2021.\n\nAir Liquide  is  committed to meaningful  social dialog  in all  of  its subsidiaries. This comes in different forms according to local regulations. In 2022, 86% of Group employees had access to a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nThe performance review meeting is a key stage in employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and their manager on performance and development, the assessment and  setting  objectives for  the  year  ahead.  In  2022, 78% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\n## 1.3. DISCRIMINATION\n\n## 1.3.1.  Risks associated with discrimination\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and policy and the Group considers it a source of strength, creativity and performance. It is a fundamental element  of the organization, in terms  of both businesses and employees, and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe discrimination risk is part of the environment and society risks (described  in  chapter  2  of  this  Universal  Registration  Document on page 87).\n\nAir Liquide carries out activities with high technological content in a  large  number of countries with  different  cultures.  The Group's objective in  this  regard is  to  have  teams  comprising  employees who represent the environment in which they operate. Each entity is  therefore responsible for implementing action plans specific to its own environment and legal framework, which may include many forms of diversity (skin color, disability, ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, etc.).\n\nof this new initiative is in line with Air Liquide's sustainable development objectives and enables employees to get involved in areas such as professional integration, children's learning, environmental protection, health and social inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXAMPLES OF CITIZENS AT WORK INITIATIVES CARRIED OUT IN 2022\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide France Industrie employees were involved in preparing 750 meals for distribution to disadvantaged people in the Paris region;\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide employees in South Korea supported students throughout the year as part of a mentoring program called 'ALTogether';\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide USA employees took part in cleaning up a bayou in the  Houston area, as part of the 'Clean It  Like  You  Mean  It' Trash Bash operation.",

Policy and procedures\n\nThe Group's objective is to increase diversity among managerial staff to better recognize the many cultures from which Air Liquide employee come and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified gender  equality targets  have  been  set  for the  Group. The local entities took an inventory of the current situation to define an objective at the level of the clusters and thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\nWithin the Human Resources organization, a team leads projects designed to improve diversity. The Group's roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploy diversity objectives at all entities and implement corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improve all  of the Group's Human Resources processes to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promote  an inclusive  culture to leverage the  diversity within teams.\n\nEach hub  and  business then  implements its  own  roadmap and diversity action plans taking the local context into consideration. In this context, they analyze processes and practices, identify potential biases and implement corrective measures ('nudges') to limit these biases. Thus, during the regular reviews of talents with high potential, the diversity of profiles is taken into account, with the aim of continuing to increase diversity in the Group's key positions.  This serves as a way to promote the  many  cultures present within the Group, and to strengthen gender equality.\n\nThrough its diversity policy, Air Liquide is therefore committed to combating all forms of discrimination.\n\n## 1.3.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group aim to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 5 'Gender equality' and 10 'Reduced inequalities'.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide employed 67,100 collaborators in 73 countries (1) .\n\n## Gender equality\n\nPERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AMONG MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Including Airgas since 2017.\n- (b) The share of women among \"Managers and Professionals\" is rounded off in increments of 0.5%.\n- (c) Including Airgas since 2016.\n\nThe Group has set a number of ambitious gender equality objectives, aimed at reaching a rate of:\n\n- \u25a0 35% women at the 'Managers and Professionals' level,  by 2025. These  objectives are in line with  the results obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 26% in 2012 to 31.5% (2) in 2022;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\nThe ambitious gender diversity objectives set for the 'Managers and Professionals' and 'senior executives' population, and for maintaining  the gender diversity  goal among the  Group's  'high potentials,' are also intended to form a talent pool to ensure balanced gender representation on the Executive Committee by promoting female talents to higher levels of management. Moreover, in view of the new obligations laid down by the 'Rixain' Law of December 24, 2021, the Group is also aligning its gender equality  objectives  with  regard  to  the  Executive Committee with those of the Law, i.e. 30% of women by March 1, 2026.\n\nIn 2022, women represented 47%  of  employees considered  as high performers, this  level has been increasing regularly for a number of years and must be maintained.\n\nThe Executive Committee includes four women among its 14 members.\n\nMore generally, and taking the highest level of responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 24.8 % of all positions defined as 'senior executives'. This latter percentage has increased from 19% to 24.8% over the last four years.\n\nAmong the 10% of positions with the greatest level of responsibility within Air Liquide S.A., 28.4% of them are held by women; these women have an average age of 52.6 years and a median age of 55.6 years, i.e. 3.2 years and 0.8 years less respectively than the average age (55.8 years) and median age (56.4 years) for men. This difference is due to the policy to promote women to the highest levels of responsibility earlier on in their careers, and therefore eliminate career development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nFinally, the promotion of an inclusive culture also contributes to a sustainable approach to diversity. Numerous initiatives are deployed within the Group to this end: events, learning opportunities, mentoring, networks and communities for different interest groups such as women's careers. Another recent example is the  second edition  of  the  movement  for inclusion, which  is  a development opportunity for committed employees. For seven months, 220 of these 'Inclusion & Diversity enthusiasts' designed and  carried out  experiments  across the  Group  using innovative methods to promote inclusion in  the work environment. These new approaches are disseminated throughout the organization in a spirit of continuous improvement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Professional Equality Index and five related indicators must also be made available to the Social and Economic Committee and transmitted to the Labor administration.\n\nIn 2022, the Group's 30 companies with at least 50 employees in France were audited. The weighted average Professional Equality Index stands at 90.5/100, maintaining the trend compared to 2019, 2020 and 2021. The company L'Air Liquide S.A. published its fifth annual Professional Equality Index, which reached 97/100.\n\nOutside of France, the Group initiated a common process to assess the gender pay gap by creating an internal index based on the  French index but tailored to Air Liquide's global presence. It was deployed for the first time in 2019 for entities with more than 400 employees. This index from the year 2021 onwards is calculated on the basis of the weighting of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 pay gap between women and  men using  the median salary per job grade;\n- \u25a0 individual wage  increase  gap  between  women and men  per job grade;\n- \u25a0 percentage of employees  having  received  a salary  increase after a maternity leave ;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\nFor the year 2021, the scope of the index has been expanded to include entities with more than 200 employees, and the calculation method has been revised. The changes made, including the use of median salary and job classification, aim to obtain a more accurate result.\n\nThe result of the 2021 index, calculated in 2022, is 75/100 based on 74% coverage of  the  Group's employees (entities with  more than 200 employees), while the result of the 2020 index was 82/100 for  a scope covering 61% of the workforce (entities with more than 400  employees).  The lower score in  2022 is due in particular to the expansion of the index to entities with more than 200 employees, thus including countries with greater social disparities. An action plan has been deployed:\n\n- \u25a0 part of the 'Merit Increase' budget was allocated to filling gender wages gaps;\n- \u25a0 awareness workshops with HR population were organized\n\n## 2025 Objectives\n\n## 2022 Results\n\nyoung graduates among managers and professional recruitments.\n\n33%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(a) Indicator calculated annually.\n\nyoung graduates among managers and professional recruitments.\n\n## Age\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES BY AGE BRACKET IN 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is committed to fostering better qualifications and training programs  for  young  people  to  facilitate their  integration into the workplace.\n\nInternship and apprenticeship contracts are encouraged by the Group. In France,  557  young  people  have  benefited  from  workstudy contracts and 468 from an internship, combining theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\nSeniors will represent an increasing share of Air Liquide employees in  the coming  years.  Their  contribution  to  mentoring programs  (notably the  Technical Community Leaders program), and training programs aimed at younger generations will be further promoted.\n\nVarious initiatives have been introduced within the Group to ensure the support and engagement of employees nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 26 people became skills sponsors following the pilot launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'Youth-employment contracts' were continued. They include initiatives promoting the hiring and retention of older employees.\n\nInternational exchange programs are in place to attract and develop young talents: ALLEX programs for executives and EVE for technicians  (those programs include more  than  600  people since they were first created).\n\n22.4% (a)",

This  slogan  carries  a strong conviction. The inclusion of disabilities is fully in line with the policy to promote diversity within Air Liquide.\n\nThis desire is not new, it has been embodied since 2007 in successive agreements in France which have advanced the policy of welcoming, maintaining and promoting the professional development of people with disabilities. Air Liquide is committed to finding  solutions  to  keep  disabled  people  in  the workplace. The following adjustments are planned to accommodate for disabilities in the workplace:\n\n- \u25a0 ergonomic studies and adaptation of the workstation with regard to the capacities of the person;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptation of methods of access to work premises and specific training services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nAir  Liquide  makes teams aware of the inclusion of disabilities in order to facilitate the reception and professional integration of workers with disabilities in the Company. The French subsidiaries have awareness-raising plans in order to strengthen the level of information for all  players and fight  against  any  prejudices that may persist. In 2022, a survey of employees in a selection of French entities was carried out in order to gain a better understanding of the obstacles to the inclusion of people with disabilities in the teams and thereby determine appropriate actions. The results of this survey will be shared more widely with the European disability coordinators. The French entities\n\n## 2. Environmental stakes\n\n## 2.1.

The aim of this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment rate to  reach 4.2%  in  2022  vs.  3.3% in 2018.The 2021 rate, calculated in April 2022, is 4.43% (4.35% in 2020). Negotiations with the labor unions began in late 2022 for the signature of a sixth Disability agreement for the 2023-2025 period.\n\nMore widely in Europe, other concrete actions are also carried out to change the way disability is seen in operations and accelerate the pace  of  recruitment:  campaign  ambassadors and  a  working group with managers.\n\n## Nationality\n\nThere are 35 different nationalities among Air Liquide's senior managers.

Climate risk: greenhouse gas emissions\n\nClimate risk (greenhouse gas emissions) is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 86).\n\nAir  Liquide's  business model is based on the outsourcing of the industrial gas needs of its customers who often emit large quantities of greenhouse gases, in particular in the metals, chemicals and refining industries. This outsourcing is justified by Air Liquide's expertise which allows them to optimize the energy consumption of production tools and favor low-carbon energy procurement. However, it leads to the transfer of a portion of the customer's greenhouse gas emissions to the Group.\n\nAlmost 85% of Air Liquide's large production units are Air Separation Units,  which do  not  use  any combustion  processes, hence do not directly generate any CO2 emissions and consume almost exclusively electrical energy. Electricity used by the Group to power these units generates CO2 emissions at electricity suppliers, and are classified as indirect or Scope 2 emissions.\n\nThe Group's two activities that  directly emit CO2 are hydrogen production and co-generation of steam and electricity. These account for nearly 15% of large production units and use combustion processes emitting CO \u2082 , known as direct emissions Scope 1.\n\nIn the interests of defining and developing mitigation measures for this risk, Air Liquide has defined scenarios to assess the impact of this risk on its activities.\n\n## SCENARIOS FOR AIR LIQUIDE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY\n\nIn order to develop and manage the achievement of its climate objectives, Air Liquide draws on scenarios which allow it to:\n\n- \u25a0 plan  its  activities  and assets in  a  variety  of  prospective  scenarios  to  guarantee  the Group's  resilience  going  forward  and feed  its strategy;\n- \u25a0 develop an  economic growth strategy  which  incorporates a reduction in the Group's emissions in line with trajectories that are compatible with the Paris Agreement;\n- \u25a0 analyze the possible impact of public greenhouse gas emission reduction policies on the Group and on its existing assets, as well as any dependence of the Group's carbon trajectory on these policies, in particular those aimed at making the energy sector and end markets carbon-free;\n- \u25a0 manage the Group's carbon trajectory by monitoring, notably, the impact of new investments made on the carbon footprint.\n\nAs the Group's activities are global and cover a wide-range of sectors, Air Liquide relies on various sources to develop these analyses. These include work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) based on the findings of climate science, and that of the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\n## CLIMATE TRAJECTORY\n\n## Science Based Targets commitment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn July 2019, the Group joined the Science Based Targets initiative,(SBTi), a certification created by a coalition of stakeholders committed to environmental issues.\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative provides companies with a methodology for setting a GHG emissions reduction objective based on climate science and in line with a well below 2\u00b0C scenario or a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\nFollowing  the submission of its application to  SBTi in November 2021, Air Liquide's  objectives have been approved by  SBTi, and determined in May 2022 to be compliant with a well below 2\u00b0C trajectory, a 'premi\u00e8re' for industrial gases. However, as of today, there is no sectoral approach specific either to the chemicals sector in general or to Air Liquide's activities, which serve a wide variety of sectors of the economy. The objectives submitted by Air Liquide aim, for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in absolute terms, at a 35% reduction in 2035 compared to a base year of 2021, considered as the first year with full deployment of 'market-based' reporting. Air Liquide has therefore joined, together with other stakeholders, an SBTi-led initiative to develop a sectoral approach for the chemical sector so it can continue to contribute to the development of methodologies for the chemical and industrial gases sector, and enhance the value of its climate protection actions, both in terms of its emissions and the resulting environmental benefits to its customers.\n\nAir  Liquide  has  signed  the  French  Business  Climate Pledge, demonstrating its  commitment  to  take  concrete  action for  a  low-carbon society.\n\nThe Group contributed to the Assessing Low Carbon Transition (ACT) initiative aiming to develop tools to assess low carbon strategies in the chemical sector.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policy and procedures\n\nTo reinforce the climate objectives announced in November 2018, which set the framework under which the Group takes active measures for the climate in its operations, with its customers and ecosystems by offering low -carbon solutions, Air Liquide announced new sustainable development objectives on March 23, 2021. In line with the Paris Agreement, and to face the urgency of taking climate change and energy transition into account, Air Liquide has shown its commitment by setting itself the ambition  of  achieving carbon  neutrality  by  2050,  with two  major intermediate milestones:\n\n- \u25a0 the start of reduction of absolute CO2 emissions around 2025;\n- \u25a0 a -33%  reduction in Scopes 1 and 2 CO2 emissions (3) by 2035, compared with a 'market-base' (4) 2020 baseline.\n\nThe objective of reducing carbon intensity by -30% by 2025 compared to 2015 (5) emissions has been maintained.\n\nIn 2022, Group's Climate Policy has been added to the BlueBook (6) , to consolidate the principles governing Group's management of Climate risks, covering the full value chain.\n\nThe monitoring and achievement of the Group's climate objectives rely on:\n\n- \u25a0 the internal greenhouse gas emissions procedure, which sets out the monitoring of current greenhouse gas emission regulatory obligations with which the Group must comply; the methodology for calculating Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, as well as the reporting scope and frequency;\n- \u25a0 integration of the monitoring of the CO2 trajectory performance in the Group's management process, in particular the CO2 budgeting process that now includes the allocation of a carbon budget to the different geographical areas, as well as quarterly monitoring by  geography and  business line  at  the Executive Committee level;\n- \u25a0 a review of investment decisions, taking climate factors - and in  particular  a  CO2  price -  into consideration, along  with an analysis of the opportunities and risks associated with climate transition.  For  all  its  projects,  for  all  geographies,  even  those without a current price for CO2, Air Liquide includes in its investment decision process a CO2 price sensitivity study. Different values are used, including a baseline price of 50 euros per tonne of CO2, the current local price and a high value of 100 euros or more per tonne, depending on geography and context;\n- \u25a0 the  implementation of the  'Climate  Champions'  network and the regular review of the geographical decarbonization plans. The plans define the projects to be carried out in order to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the Group's objectives, such as the supply of renewable energy, CO2 capture on hydrogen production units, energy  efficiency  programs or vehicle fleet conversion programs;\n- \u25a0 the assumption of the introduction, in the regions in which the Group  operates,  of public policies  aimed  at  stepping up the transition toward a low-carbon economy that are in line with a 'well below 2\u00b0C' trajectory.\n\nThe main lines  of the Group's  action plans are detailed in the \"Acting for a low-carbon  society\"  infographics on  pages  361  to 364.\n\nIn order to reduce its indirect emissions related to power procurement (Scope 2 emissions), Air Liquide is increasing its sourcing of renewable power, using several approaches depending on local conditions allowing access to renewable power.\n\nThe main approach is the signature of long term Power Purchase Agreements (PPA). However, the Group may purchase certificates such as Guarantees of Origin that may or may not be bundled with power delivery especially when integration of a PPA into the sourcing portfolio is uneasy or, in areas supplied by regulated utilities, through 'green tariffs'.\n\n## SCOPE 3 COMMITMENT\n\nAware  of the importance of contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality throughout its value chain, in 2022, Air Liquide worked on developing its Scope 3 emissions reduction strategy. The value of its customer relationships has led the Group to make a pledge that 75% of its 50 largest customers will have a stated carbon neutrality commitment by 2025 and 100% by 2035. In addition, Air Liquide will continue its in-depth analysis of all Scope 3 emission categories in 2023, leveraging the work carried out by the Expert Advisory Group (EAG) led by SBTi.",

However,  given the ambitious  decarbonization  plan of  the  Group, including for the Sasol project, this does not compromise the -30% intensity reduction objective to reach a carbon intensity of 5.1 (\"market-based\" methodology) by 2025 vs. 2015 baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This reflects the Group's strong commitment to controlling its CO2 emissions trajectory and the measures implemented.\n\nReported emissions increased in 2022 due to the full-year inclusion of emissions related to the assets acquired from Sasol, which  only contributed to  reported  emissions in 2021  from the date of their integration on June 24, 2021. The implementation of emission reduction plans in the various regions where the Group operates have helped moderate the increase of emissions, despite its strong growth in activity.\n\nAs a result, the volumes of renewable electricity, in the electricity supply, have increased by approximately 10% in 2022. The\n\ngrowth in the volume of renewable electricity, in the Group's supply, is set to continue and accelerate, as shown by the signing of several long-term contracts (PPAs) in 2022, namely with Vattenfall  in the  Netherlands,  with Shell Energy Europe Limited and with Enel Green Power, jointly with Sasol, in South Africa. In addition, the Group continues to develop CO2 capture projects to reduce emissions associated with hydrogen production, such as the Kairos@C and Antwerp@C projects.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Sasol air separation units in South Africa on June 24, 2021, the Group's carbon intensity increased in 2021, reflecting only half-year impact, from the date of acquisition.

This method does not generally deal with a product's economic or social aspects, but the approach and methodologies of the life cycle  described  in  the  international  standard  can  also be applied to these other aspects.\n\nA team of LCA practitioners operating from the different R&D centers of the Group supports the Group in deploying this tool to assess and quantify, on products or  projects,  positive  and  negative  impacts  on climate, water and marine resource, waste, pollutant emissions, biodiversity, and ecosystems.\n\nFor  instance,  Air  Liquide's  production of hydrogen  delivered to refineries leads to  direct CO2 emissions: an in-depth life cycle analysis highlighted the fact that the environmental cost relating to the CO \u2082 emissions associated with this hydrogen production is largely offset by the benefit of the elimination of acid rain and the decrease in respiratory diseases.\n\nThe Group relies on this approach to:\n\n- \u25a0 assess and take account the environmental impacts when designing technologies, products, and offers;\n- \u25a0 maintain and enrich its stakeholders interactions by proposing sustainable solutions to customers and suppliers;\n- \u25a0 improve the efficiency of its  processes, rethink the  production chain  and  make  the best long-term strategic choices for its investments.\n\nIn  2022, Air  Liquide  has  complemented this  approach  with an  ongoing  project  aiming  at  harmonizing  methodologies for  Carbon Footprint of products. The project covers the various gases produced and  sold by the Group and their respective production pathways. The objective is to provide clear information to customers on their carbon footprint related to Air Liquide supplies and accompany them in their CO2 emissions reduction journey.\n\n## CLIMATE AND ENERGY TRANSITION TRAINING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide University continued to offer the 'Climate & Energy Transition On-Boarding' training program. The objective is to share the Group's vision and provide knowledge and behaviors that will ensure  resilience  and safeguard growth opportunities  associated  with  climate  and  energy transition. On-boarding topics cover climate, customers and technology. Since the program's launch, more than 1,489 employees have participated in at least one session.\n\nn\n\ner\n\n## 2.1.5.  Engaging stakeholders\n\nSince the announcement  of  its climate objectives  at  the end  of 2018, Air Liquide set up a dedicated in-house organizational structure. The announcement of these objectives and the associated action plan have proven to be factors that drive engagement among Group employees and were further boosted by the announcement of new sustainability objectives on the 23 rd March 2021.\n\n## Climate Champions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresent within each cluster (group of countries), Climate Champions are responsible for managing the Group's CO2 emissions reduction objectives. The Climate  Champions are the Sustainable Development Department's point of contact in the different clusters (group of countries).\n\nThey  coordinate  the development of a roadmap that  defines  all the operational measures required to achieve the climate objectives. Their role includes monitoring KPIs, rolling out projects and reporting progress.\n\nThe Group Sustainable Development Department is the facilitator of this network that is currently composed of 14 Climate Champions: meetings are held monthly, and in 2022, a two day webinar brought together more than 40 experts and managers to share experiences and good practices regarding decarbonization technologies and solutions, renewable energy sourcing, and other CO2 emissions reduction topics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Previously called 'Climate Ambassadors' and renamed 'Sustainability Ambassadors' in 2022 to account for the extended role covering all  aspects of sustainable development, the members implement local initiatives within their entities, raise awareness among employees and share best practices.\n\nTheir actions cover recycling, zero-waste campaigns, and sustainable  mobility.  The  network  has  more  than 600 members, spread across  the Group's  various  geographies, compared with 450 in 2021, demonstrating the growing interest of employees in sustainable development issues.\n\nThese actions are also relayed on a dedicated Intranet site where general information on sustainable development and the Group's strategy in this area is accessible: sustainable development objectives, educational videos, articles, current projects, local initiatives, etc.\n\n## TYPES OF INITIATIVES IN 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INTRODUCING A SYSTEM OF PLASTIC REUSABLE CAPS ON GAS CYLINDERS\n\nIn Austria, a system of reusable plastic caps has been implemented by a 'Sustainability Ambassador' on gas cylinders to limit the use of plastic and its inadvertent dispersal by customers into  nature.  With  the  support of Ambassador's management, the use of reusable caps was successfully tested for one year, which led to a reduction in environmental impact as well as savings in handling time and procurement. The concept has been extended to other cylinder  types in  Austria and  could be deployed more widely in the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY DAY\n\nAs Air Liquide makes progress towards its sustainability ambition, it is of the utmost importance to ensure employees have the necessary information and resources to  understand  the Group's objectives, the progress made towards achieving those objectives, and how they can relate their own actions to the Group's sustainability strategy.\n\nTo achieve the ambition to inform and promote the Group's sustainability objectives, the Group hosted an internal 'Sustainability Day' on  November 15,  2022.  This  internal event featured a corporate webinar featuring sustainability actions and initiatives taking place around the world. In the days that followed, local events under the framework of the Sustainability Day were organized in the Group's various geographies.\n\nIn December 2022, the Group launched an internal sustainability survey, reaching more than 78% of the Group population, to measure the interest of its employees in ESG thematic as well as their  personal  involvement  in  these  subjects. The  data  collected provides insight into the Group's strengths, for instance, employees' belief that sustainability should be a top priority for Air Liquide. In this sense, the survey also reflects opportunities for the Group to improve, notably by providing sufficient information and training on  sustainability  topics.  In 2023, Air Liquide  will launch actions to address employee feedback and increase sustainability-related engagement.",

CLIMATE: PHYSICAL IMPACT ON OPERATIONS\n\n## 2.2.1.  Climate: physical impact on operations\n\nThis risk is part of the Environment and Society risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 87).\n\nAir Liquide  operates  in  certain  regions  of  the world  exposed  to changes (in amplitude or frequency) in exceptional meteorological phenomena due to climate change. These phenomena can slow down or interrupt the Group's operations or make them more expensive. Its  suppliers  and  customers are  also  confronted  with this same issue.\n\nThese can be broken down into:\n\n- \u25a0 acute risks triggered by events such as natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which are increasing: storms, hurricanes, flooding, etc. These risks may relate to Air Liquide sites located near the coast for example, or in regions affected by hurricanes (the Gulf Coast, South Asia, etc.);\n- \u25a0 chronic risks related to more long-term changes in climate models and rising temperatures: rising sea levels, chronic heat waves in certain regions, changes in rainfall patterns and an increase in their variability, the disappearance of certain resources, etc.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nPhysical risks (water availability, frequency of extreme events, etc.)  are appraised during  the  review  of  investment  requests, in the same way as financial criteria, to ensure that the associated risk management measures are adapted, for example, in the design of equipment.\n\nIn addition, Group  operations  that are regularly  exposed to the acute  risks described  above  have risk  management  systems in place aimed at adopting suitable preventive operational measures and managing these crises by, first and foremost, protecting individuals and the production facilities in close cooperation with customers. These systems are regularly updated and improved.\n\nChronic risks are taken into account, particularly in the design of production units, in the same way, and to the same extent as their energy efficiency and carbon footprint.\n\nIn 2022, these risks are already taken into account, especially in (i) the  Water  Management Policy,  which concerns, among other things, water-related risks for production units for which this risk is proven, and (ii) Business Continuity Plans that ensure the resilience of operations in the event of disruption, including extreme climatic events.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide launched an initiative to consolidate and further improve the risk management process for climate impacts on operations. A scoping phase was conducted in 2022 with the objective of consolidating and structuring a procedure for the Group in 2023, to be deployed in 2024. With the implementation of this procedure, Air Liquide will:\n\n- \u25a0 identify the perils linked to the physical impacts of climate change,  according to  one  or more scenarios with  high CO2 emissions;\n- \u25a0 evaluate the importance of these risks for the Group's activities;\n- \u25a0 develop, if necessary, adaptation plans.\n\nThese risks, like the other climate risks described in this section, are taken into account in the preparation of the Financial Statements (paragraph 'Use of estimates and assumptions' of the accounting principles and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Chapter 4), page 257 and 309 respectively).\n\n## 2.2.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 'Industry, innovation and infrastructure,' 12 'Responsible consumption and production,' and 13 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and  its impacts'.  As a first step, a workshop gathering  experts from various technical areas and several geographies was organized to identify material climate change related hazards; in parallel, a first assessment of available climate modeling tools has been conducted.\n\nFor this scoping phase, the Group also relied on the work performed in 2021: a group of internal experts who, in partnership with external stakeholders, analyzed risks triggered by climate change based  on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This analysis focused on specific assets to strengthen the understanding of key parameters.\n\nIn 2022, under  the European Union's  Taxonomy  Regulation,  an assessment of Do Not Significant Harm (DNSH) was conducted for the Group's activities identified as eligible for the climate change mitigation objective. This assessment includes the evaluation of the climate risk related to water and especially, the changes that could occur in terms of water availability during the life of the sites, for the hydrogen production activity. As part of a continuous improvement approach and as the Group's environmental program develops, additional analyses will be carried out on  climate-related  risks and their materiality for the Group's various activities. In addition, new tools will be deployed to map the relevant risks geographically according to the different climate scenarios.\n\n## 2.3. WATER MANAGEMENT\n\n## 2.3.1.  Water management risk\n\nThe Group depends on water for its activities. Its water consumption is related to the loss of water by evaporation in the process of cooling rotating machines, particularly for the production of air gases, or its use as a raw material for the manufacture of products such as hydrogen.\n\nAir Liquide pays particular attention to water management, especially in areas of water stress. The main water management risk for Air Liquide's activities is the possible lack of availability of water which could result in a slowdown or shutdown of a production unit. Moreover, Air Liquide integrates the risks for other stakeholders in its water management. The management of water in its activities can have two main types of impact on people:\n\n- \u25a0 related to the withdrawal and use of water on the sites where the Group operates;\n- \u25a0 related to the quality of water returned to ecosystems after use,  as  set  out in  Chapter 2, Section 4.2.1 of the  Vigilance Plan (page 124).",

Policy and procedures\n\nTo manage the risks associated with water withdrawal and use as well as the quality of the water returned to ecosystems, a water management policy has been published in the BlueBook in 2021.\n\nThis policy identifies the impact of Air Liquide's activities on water availability  and quality. The policy defines the  principles  of risk management based on a specific assessment of the situation at each site.  Finally,  it  describes  the  actions  to  be  implemented  to ensure appropriate water management.\n\n## WATER MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide initiated the rollout of the water management policy focusing on the following Group objectives that have been defined in 2021:\n\n- \u25a0 implementing a documented water management plan by 2025 aimed at reducing water withdrawal and use risks for waterintensive operations in areas of high water stress;\n- \u25a0 defining and implementing a Group-wide standard for all operations that goes beyond existing local processes and procedures and guarantees that the quality of discharged water will meet or exceed applicable local criteria.\n\nThe action plans to achieve these objectives are being rolled out. In 2022 a working group that included several water experts developed  the foundational work required  for the  roll-out of the Group water policy, consisting in the assessment of sites by their levels of water use and water stress location, as well as the creation of  guidelines, standards,  and tools to  support the  field deployment that will start in 2023. In particular this foundation work included the preparation of:\n\n- \u25a0 guidelines and tools for  implementing a water management plan for water-intensive operations in areas of high water stress;\n- \u25a0 a new technical standard regarding the sustainable monitoring and control of industrial wastewater that is expected to be issued to all operations in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the Group continued improving the water data collection and reporting accuracy. This included the update of the technical standard used for the environmental data reporting, as well as the organization of training webinars with the field teams in charge of environmental data reporting. Air Liquide has a network of water experts across all regions. Their role is to act as dedicated contact points for all questions relating to water and its use and to verify data (withdrawal, restitution, quality).\n\n## 2.3.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6  'Clean water and sanitation', 12 'Responsible consumption and production' and 14 'Life below water.'\n\nFor several years, Air Liquide has been implementing initiatives to improve data collection and better guide water management on its production sites to reduce water consumption, particularly in water-stressed areas.\n\nIn 2022,  Air Liquide consumed 91 million m\u00b3 of water, a 11% increase compared with 2021, which is mainly related to acquisitions, and in particular to the acquisition of the Sasol production units.\n\nAir Liquide withdrew 973 million m\u00b3 of water from various sources. 87% came from customers, 6% came from  freshwater  sources such as rivers and lakes, 2% from municipal supply and the remaining 5% from various other sources.\n\nIn 2022, more than 40% the water discharged from the Air Liquide Facilities has been reused by third parties (typically customers) for their own usage, after treatment, if necessary. This usage allowed the third party to not withdraw the corresponding amount of water from the natural environment\n\nIn terms of  water  usage, several types of  cooling systems  are utilized at Air Separation Units (ASU):\n\n- \u25a0 54% of these units have semi-open water circuits, where some of the water evaporates during cooling;\n- \u25a0 39% of these units have open circuits. The water passes through the plant to cool it, and all the water taken is returned. Both types of units require continuous water top-ups for cooling;\n- \u25a0 finally, the other units have closed systems, which do not extract water from their surrounding environment. These consume no water after the initial filling.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment takes into account the specific data for each site according to its location in terms of a watershed, groundwater and an administrative boundary.\n\nTo  carry  out  this assessment, the  Group  used  the 'business  as usual'  scenario  (SSP2 RCP8.5 of the  IPCC).  Each site is thus identified as belonging to an area of water stress (8) or  not (area\n\n(8)\n\ndefined according to the intensity of water conflict). This mapping also includes new units.\n\nAn analysis that has been conducted in 2022 focused on water intensive operations  (i.e. facilities  that  have a water withdrawal greater than  50,000  m 3 per year)  shows  that  there  are 78 sites located in high and extremely high water stress locations. By 2025, 100% of these sites have the objective of implementing a documented management plan aimed at reducing water withdrawal and use risks.",

The Group continues to support its customers to meet more stringent regulations, and to fight water stress and scarcity with cost-effective solutions.\n\nAir Liquide's 'Essential Small Molecules' (mainly O2, O3 and CO2) play a fundamental role in drinking water and wastewater treatment processes. These gases are key to balance mineral levels  in desalination  of water plants,  or to  eliminate  pollutants from surface drinking water. For industrial players seeking technologies to treat and recycle water, these molecules help boost  the removal of organic pollution from wastewater  and to avoid corrosion or clogging in cooling systems.\n\nThe Group continues to innovate in water treatment to help respond to the growing needs of global markets.\n\nFor example, in 2022, Air Liquide has invested in and partnered with InOpsys, a Belgian scale-up that developed innovative technology to treat wastewater streams without discharging hazardous materials into the environment. The two companies work together in an open innovation partnership and have designed a solution for a multinational pharmaceutical company's production facility in Belgium.\n\n(9)\n\n## 2.4. BIODIVERSITY\n\nBiodiversity refers to living species of all kinds, including terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems,  and also the ecosystems to which they belong. It includes diversity within and between species, the diversity of ecosystems, and the interactions between living organisms.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Risk associated with biodiversity\n\nAir Liquide is mindful of its impact on biodiversity, which encompasses both the diversity of living things and the links between species themselves. At a time when the balance of natural environments is threatened, it is important to preserve biodiversity - not only because of the many services it provides to human society, but also for its own intrinsic value.\n\nThere are two ways in which companies can interact with biodiversity:  in  terms  of  impact and  in  terms  of  dependency.  In addition, the  IPBES (9) identified  five pressures  that companies can have  on biodiversity, which  are  land degradation, pollution, climate change, overexploitation of biological resources and invasive species. The approach to the issue of biodiversity must therefore cover the company's entire value chain, from resource management to product life cycle analysis and must cover the five pressures.\n\nIn 2022,  Air Liquide completed an in-depth  review of its value chain's impact on biodiversity, which was launched in 2021. Through an assessment of the direct and indirect impact along the value  chain  -  not  only  the  Group's operation  but also  upstream and downstream - this approach allowed to identify positive and negative impacts and dependencies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this reason, the Group's impact in terms of land occupation and degradation is limited and, where necessary, is the subject of particular attention,\n- -the  other  impacts  are  primarily  indirect  and linked  to  CO2 emissions, water consumption and discharges, and certain atmospheric discharges which are already addressed through the Group Climate Policy and Water Policy.\n- \u25a0 The main impacts associated with biodiversity are indirect and outside of the Group operations:\n- -the Group's operations are rarely directly dependent on ecosystem services;  this dependence is mainly  related  to two specific  activities,  biomethane  and  Seppic's activities, through their reliance on agricultural supplies and, for Seppic, reliance on living species,\n- -the electricity sourcing mix of the Group which has an indirect  impact on water consumption and climate change due to certain energy sources used, such as nuclear, natural gas  or coal, which  have direct impacts on water consumption and climate change,\n- -some other impacts  identified as minor  linked  to specific sourced materials, fuels and feedstocks  production have been identified,\n- -furthermore, the Group allows to avoid certain impacts on biodiversity through some of its products such as hydrogen used for fuel desulfurization, thus reducing  emissions of sulfur compounds, as well as through its solutions to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gases emissions by its customers.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nThe Group currently addresses the  issue  of  biodiversity  through different ways adapted to the issue at stake:\n\n- \u25a0 Seppic  (a  Group subsidiary  developing  specialty  ingredients) and biomethane's activities have their own dedicated policies to address  their business-specific issues.  Seppic commits  to reduce the pressure put on biodiversity by its supplies;\n- \u25a0 a  procedure is  being  developed to assess the environmental impact of new projects;\n- \u25a0 main indirect impacts of the Group are addressed through the climate change and water policies, and  industrial standards regarding waste and pollutant emissions.\n\nAir Liquide intends to continuously raise its environmental ambition and is reinforcing its action toward biodiversity preservation in 2022.",

This will be defined in 2023 and be deployed thereafter.\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide  commits  to reinforce its biodiversity assessment criteria into the investment process for all new projects by 2024.\n\n## Biomethane business\n\nIn addition to energy production, methanization contributes to waste treatment and the production of organic fertilizer, which replaces fertilizers of fossil origin. This multifunctionality leads to numerous environmental externalities on the climate, air, soil, and water quality with impacts on biodiversity on a local or global scale in the short and long term.\n\nAlthough most of the impacts of a biomethane project are generated outside Air Liquide's perimeter, the Group is working on a dedicated sustainability charter for its Biogas activities that integrates the entire value chain. In 2022, Air Liquide has joined forces with key players in the sector and is mobilizing internal and external expertise to set up a harmonized and objective framework to better take into account and control externalities in the development and operations of biomethane production projects.\n\n## Seppic\n\nSpecial attention is paid to the value chain of Seppic, an Air Liquide subsidiary which has been manufacturing and marketing specialty ingredients for more than 75 years. As Seppic's biodiversity challenges mainly relate to procurement, Seppic ensures that supplies comply with the Group's responsible procurement policy. More specifically, Seppic adheres to biodiversity regulations for the countries in which it accesses genetic  resources  and their derivatives;  to  the principles of the Convention  on Biological Diversity  and the  Nagoya  Protocol for access  to  genetic  resources and  the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization. Seppic constantly monitors developments in associated regulatory tools and the status of the plant and marine species it uses with regard to CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and UICN (International Union for the Conservation  of  Nature)  lists  of  threatened and endangered species. An internal validation process is established with a\n\nsteering committee to ensure that the use of raw materials complies with the Nagoya Protocol and applicable national laws. In addition, as palm derivatives represent almost half of its natural origin inputs by volume, Seppic is taking actions to actively promote the sustainable transformation of the palm oil supply chain. In order to do so, Seppic is building its approach by relying on the RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil) massbalance certification and by participating in the ASD initiative (Action for Sustainable Derivatives). Seppic's goal is to play  a proactive role in tackling deforestation and to ensure human rights are respected in the palm industry. Seppic ensures its direct suppliers  take a  proactive stance  by  accompanying them every year in investigating the supply chain up to the mills as well as in investigating how grievances are managed.\n\n## 2.4.3.  Performance\n\nThe actions undertaken by the Group are intended to contribute to the UN Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs)  14 'Life  below water' and 15 'Life on land'.\n\n## Actions undertaken by the Group\n\nAfter analyzing the materiality matrix conducted in 2020 that highlighted the biodiversity topic, Air Liquide launched in 2021 and finalized in 2022 a project with the  company I Care  &  Consult (ICC) to assess all its dependencies and the pressure it puts on biodiversity allowing to structure the Group's impacts on biodiversity around the five pressures identified by the IPBES as illustrated in paragraph 2.4.1. This in-depth analysis served as a basis to pinpoint the priority issues for the roll out of the Group's biodiversity strategy in 2022.\n\nAs part of this process, Air Liquide mapped in 2021 all of its sites to identify  those located near  protected areas according to the IUCN's Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) database. The KBAs correspond to areas identified based on specific criteria such as areas that make a  significant contribution  to biodiversity within various ecosystems. Proximity to these areas reflect the heightened sensitivity of biodiversity to human activity. This review, found that 13% of Air Liquide sites in 2021 were located within a 50-km radius of at least nine KBAs (mainly in Europe due to  the  large  number of KBAs recognized by regulations) and for which heightened attention must be paid in regard to any pressure that may be put on biodiversity. Air Liquide is currently working on determining, for the various type of activities, what is the relevant radius regarding its sites' proximity to KBAs. As KBAs may change over time, Air Liquide will renew this mapping on a regular basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example, the methanization of livestock effluents or communities' organic waste helps prevent certain ammonia or methane emissions generated by their storage and decomposition, at the edge of fields or in landfill. This business, by preventing these emissions, thus contributes to the protection of biodiversity as part of a circular economy approach.\n\n## Actions undertaken by Seppic\n\nIn order to better identify the impacts and dependencies of its raw materials, manufacturing processes and the end-of-life of its products on biodiversity, Seppic continued its collaboration with I Care & Consult (ICC) initiated in 2020. The results show that the majority of Seppic's biodiversity impact is due to the purchase of certain raw materials. Among these raw materials, biobased derivatives stand out as having the larger footprint, mostly due to the impact of land use during  the agricultural phase.  However, these impacts can be limited by the use of certification, which can reduce the impact on various indicators. This is notably the case for RSPO Mass Balance certified palm derivatives. These results have allowed Seppic to refine its objectives and to set up an action plan to reduce its biodiversity impacts in the future.\n\nWith regard to its strategy for dealing with palm derivatives, Seppic is continuing its program to ensure that 100% of its incoming raw materials will be Mass Balance certified by 2025. In 2022, 97% of Seppic's palm oil inputs were already Mass Balance certified (either RSPO or ISCC+ (10) ) and the rest were covered by the 'Book & Claim' certificates of small, independent producers, meaning all of Seppic's sourced palm derivatives  were  certified. Since 2019, Seppic has been producing annual traceability reports  for  its procurement within the framework of ASD (Action for Sustainable Derivatives)  with continuous progress. Seppic's palm strategy has also been assessed according to the Sustainable Palm Index (SPI) methodology, and Seppic has achieved a score of 94/100 in 2022, an improvement on the 91/100 score of the previous year. In addition, Seppic is encouraging and supporting growers not yet committed to RSPO certification by  contributing  to the  governance  and  funding  of  a joint project with five other ASD members, the Kaleka (11) Initiative which aims to restore the ecosystem and stimulate economic growth in two  of the  most important  palm-producing regions  of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Seppic's commitment began in 2022 for a period of five years.\n\nFinally, Seppic bases its conscious sourcing of plants and seaweeds on an in-depth knowledge of their use, their environment  and  their  stakeholders, in  compliance  with  relevant laws and internationally-recognized best practices.",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\nSeppic's sourcing strategy aims at the continuous improvement of its organization and the management of plants and seaweeds supply  in  order  to  respect  the  biodiversity  as  well  as  social and environmental issues in connection with wild harvesting and cultivation. Seppic therefore is committed to following ethical sourcing practices and tries to provide the most appropriate answers to upgrade its sustainable business and responsible sourcing model.\n\n## Actions undertaken by Group employees\n\nThe Sustainability Ambassadors, volunteer employees who want to act  in favour of sustainable  development within Air Liquide, have also organized local initiatives in favor of biodiversity:\n\n- \u25a0 in 2022, Air Liquide France Industry employees have launched a work to rethink lawn mowing on sites in order to mow lawns less intensely during flowering period in order to preserve insects. This initiative was inspired  by Kornwestheim Filling Center in Germany which has been allocating unused industry land to grow wild flowers since 2016;\n- \u25a0 in Austria, a Sustainability Ambassador has introduced a system of reusable plastic caps on gas cylinders that reduces plastic waste, handling time and costs. This initiative is currently being analyzed for replication across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SUSTAINABLE SOURCING\n\nSeppic's Lons and Pontrieux sites, which specialize in the botanical extraction of cosmetic and pharmaceutical active ingredients, joined the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT) to align their  sourcing  strategy and  good  practices  with an independent standard. As UEBT members, these sites are committed to taking into account the impact of seaweeds and plant sourcing activities on social, environmental and economic issues. By 2025, 100% of Seppic's new dermo-cosmetic and nutraceutical ingredients manufactured at the factories of Lons and Pontrieux will be sourced according to its Ethical Sourcing System (12) .\n\n## 2.5. EUROPEAN TAXONOMY\n\n## 2.5.1.  Taxonomy regulation\n\nThe  European Union  (EU)  Taxonomy  regulation (EU  Regulation 2020/852 published on June 22,  2020) defined, on a scientific basis,  a  list of  economic  activities  and  the  technical  criteria  that allows said activities to qualify as environmentally sustainable. These technical  screening  criteria  are  defined by  the European Commission (EC) in two delegated acts published on December 9, 2021 and December 10, 2021.\n\nThe list of activities was established by focusing on nine macrosectors that generated more than 93% of the EU's direct greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 (OECD).\n\nA complementary delegated act, published on July 15, 2022, included  specific nuclear and  gas  energy activities  in the  list  of economic  activities covered  by the  Taxonomy.  The  main impact for the Group is the eligibility of the activity related to cogeneration of steam and electricity.\n\nThe European Commission  (EC)  also published on October 6, 2022 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) aiming at clarifying the Delegated Acts, regarding the interpretation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy regulation on the reporting of eligible economic activities and assets. This notice clarified the definition of Operating Expenses (OpEx); Air Liquide discloses in a table below the restatement of the 2021 OpEx as, for the 2021 reporting, the Group has defined its methodology on the basis of information available in January 2022.\n\nThe first three delegated  acts relate to economic  activities that may make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation objectives (four others are planned to be published in the future).\n\nThe Taxonomy regulation has created a classification system which should serve as a common language for investors to identify the projects and  conditions  that  will enable the chosen economic activities  to  have  a  significant positive impact  on the climate and environment. As such, the regulation is a tool aimed at helping investors and listed companies, financial institutions and EU project sponsors to direct their investments toward environmentally sustainable activities as part of the transition aimed at making the EU climate neutral by 2050.\n\nThe activities listed in the Taxonomy regulation are referred to as 'eligible'. While these activities are the major contributors to direct GHG emissions, they also have the potential to be improved from a carbon footprint perspective. As such, the eligibility percentage of an organization, by itself, is not a measure of its sustainability impact .\n\nThe statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community (NACE) is the standard used to classify economic activities which are divided into three categories in the Taxonomy regulation:\n\n- \u25a0 activities for which technical criteria refer to performance levels which comply with climate neutrality and limiting temperature increase to 1.5  degrees  Celsius  at  a  global  level (i.e.  in line with a net zero carbon economy by 2050);\n- \u25a0 transitional activities for which there are no low-carbon alternatives for the moment and for which greenhouse gas emission  levels are in line  with the  best performance  in the sector or industry;\n- \u25a0 enabling activities which improve carbon efficiency or facilitate a significant decrease in emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are presented in the tables below (pages 378 to 384).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, turnover eligible to the Taxonomy (for the two objectives described above) totaled 5.2 billion euros (equivalent to 17.5% of total consolidated revenue).\n\nAn eligible activity that complies with the three following conditions and for which the requirements of the Taxonomy regulation can be documented is referred to as 'aligned':\n\n- \u25a0 it contributes substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives;\n- \u25a0 it does not significantly harm any of the environmental objectives;\n- \u25a0 it is carried out in compliance with minimum safeguards.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, turnover aligned with Taxonomy (for the two objectives described above) totaled 0.3 billion euros (equivalent to 1.2% of total consolidated revenue and to 6.6% of eligible revenue). Eligible non-aligned activities are either activities that do not meet one of the above mentioned requirements, or for which such compliance could not be reasonably documented, mainly due to lack of sufficient guidance for alignment or difficulty to access required data at the requested granularity.\n\nTurnover from activities not covered by Taxonomy, referred to as 'non-eligible', totaled 24.7 billion euros (82.5% of total consolidated revenue),  and  notably  include  the production of oxygen, medical  gases  and home healthcare.  Indeed, the  activities  associated  with production of air gases, including the activities mentioned above, generate almost no direct greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThese ratios related to the turnover capture the situation of the existing production units. However, by 2035, Air Liquide aims at investing around 8 billion euros to serve the low-carbon and renewable hydrogen markets. These investments start to be made in the frame of ADVANCE strategic plan, which also foresees 8 billion euros of investment for the energy transition, as illustrated by the share of aligned capital expenditure among eligible capital expenditure, that stood at 30.0% as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## 2.5.2.  Methodology\n\nThe  Group defined its  methodology  on the  basis  of  information available as of November 30, 2022. In particular, the methodology does not consider any recommendations published by the European Commission or other competent authorities after December 1, 2022. Notably, it does not take into account the Draft Commission notices on interpretation and implementation of certain  legal  provisions of the  EU  Taxonomy  Climate  Delegated Act and on interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the Disclosures Delegated Act under Article 8 of EU Taxonomy Regulation, issued on December 19, 2022; these texts are being analyzed.\n\n## Key performance indicators (KPIs)\n\nIn accordance with the consolidated financial statements, figures relating to the three KPIs are provided in millions of euros, and the conversion of foreign  currencies  is  carried out  according to the same methodology and using the same exchange rates as those used to prepare financial information.\n\n- \u25a0 Turnover: the first Taxonomy KPI is calculated by eligible activity and by facility, based on external revenue (i.e. excluding  intra-group sales)  as  determined and published in the  financial  statements  under 'Revenue' line  in  the income statement. If revenue by facility is  not available,  the entities apply a ratio based on volumes delivered by each facility. Revenue corresponds to revenue from contracts with customers as defined under IFRS 15 standard.\n- \u25a0 Capital expenditure (CapEx): the second Taxonomy KPI includes acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets completed during the period under consideration, including those stemming from business combinations that result in the acquisition  of a company or business consolidated in the Group's financial statements. These additions are considered before impairment, depreciation and amortization, and any revaluation. It is calculated based on the internal management of investments. Investment decisions exceeding 3 million euros are monitored individually  and  their Taxonomy characteristics are presented to the Resources and Investment Committee. Capital expenditure related to these investment decisions is monitored\n\non a per-project basis. Capital expenditure of less than 3 million euros is monitored by production site or, when several production units are  involved,  calculated  using  a  ratio  based on the turnover KPI.\n\nThe lines  in the  Financial  Statements  that correspond  to  the CapEx KPI are included in Note 11 - 'Other intangible assets,' on the line 'Total gross intangible assets' of the columns 'Acquisitions' and 'Acquisitions related to business combinations'; and in Note 12 -'Property, plant and equipment' of the 'Total  property,  plant and equipment' line under the 'Acquisitions' and 'Acquisitions related to business combinations' columns.\n\n- \u25a0 Operating expenses (OpEx): the third Taxonomy KPI is calculated based on direct non-capitalized expenses for research and development, building renovation, short term leases,  maintenance and  repairs,  as  well  as  all other direct expenses relating to the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment assets that are necessary to ensure the continuous and efficient running of these assets.\n\nThe Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), published on October 6, 2022, clarified the definition of the OpEx. The main impact for Air Liquide is the removal of the purchase of industrial gases,  natural gas/naphtha  and electricity,  and the restriction of personnel costs to those related to maintenance. Air Liquide discloses in the table on page 382 the restatement of the 2021 OpEx.\n\nIn 2022, the OpEx include direct expenses relating to the nature of the following costs, that are necessary for the production of products included in the revenue KPI: Personnel costs related to maintenance, Subcontracted maintenance and installation, Rental and leasing of real estate and transportation, Purchases of materials related to maintenance, general R&D expenses. The OpEx KPI is calculated directly or indirectly, by allocating expenses on the basis of the turnover KPI. Income statement lines relating to the OpEx KPI are 'Purchases,' 'Personnel expenses' and 'Other expenses'.",

It relied upon:\n- A. processes applied by the Group, including but not limited to the  Code  of  Conduct,  the  whistleblowing system EthiCall, the Group' sustainable procurement policy, the Vigilance Plan, the  prevention measures relating to  corruption and fair competition, and the tax risk management policy. These processes are further described in Chapters 2 and 5 of the present Universal Registration Document. Regarding human rights and corruption, the assessment encompassed the supply chain.\n- B. the absence of serious negative impact or event related to the four dimensions (notably the absence of serious breach or conviction).\n\nWhere  the assessment  could  not be  sufficiently  evidenced, the Group adopted a conservative approach and did not consider the eligible activity as aligned.\n\n## 2.5.3.  Taxonomy's key performance indicators (KPI)\n\nThe tables presented hereafter correspond to the activities listed for the objective of climate change mitigation. No activity was identified as eligible to the objective of climate change adaptation.\n\nThe following table recaps the eligibility and alignment ratios for each Taxonomy's key performance indicator. The detailed tables are presented hereafter.\n\n| Proportion (%)                       | Turnover   | Capital expenditure   | Operating expenses   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n| KPI - Eligible activities            | 17.5 %     | 9.2 %                 | 9.0 %                |\n| KPI - Aligned activities             | 1.2 %      | 2.8 %                 | 2.5 %                |\n| Ratio of aligned/eligible activities | 6.6 %      | 30.0 %                | 27.7 %               |\n\nAir Liquide's eligible activities represent a small portion of the Group's activities, reflecting the fact that the majority of Air Liquide's revenue is generated from activities with almost no direct greenhouse gas emissions within the Group's scope .\n\nThus, 2022 turnover eligible for EU Taxonomy represented 5,237.7 million euros, or 17.5% of total revenue. Turnover aligned as per the EU Taxonomy amounted to 346.2 million euros, or 1.2% of total turnover and 6.6% of eligible turnover.\n\nEligible CapEx represented  380.6  million euros, or  9.2% of the total 2022 Group's capital  expenditure as defined  in  paragraph 2.5.2.: this is  related to  capital expenditure  incurred  during the 2022 fiscal year on eligible activities but stemming from investment decisions made in 2022 or in previous periods. Aligned Capex represented 114.3  million euros,  or  2.8% of total  CapEx and 30.0% of eligible CapEx.\n\nBy 2035, Air  Liquide  aims at investing around 8 billion  euros  to serve the low-carbon and renewable hydrogen markets, covering the primary production, supply chain and logistics, to accompany the markets linked to  the  energy transition. Air  Liquide has also announced its ambition to develop 3 GW of electrolysis for hydrogen production by 2030. In addition, in the ADVANCE strategic plan, 16 billion euros will be invested by the Group over the period 2021-2025, 50% of which will go to the Energy Transition.\n\nEligible OpEx represented  455.0  million  euros,  i.e.  9.0% of the Group's operating expenses. Aligned OpEx represented 125.8 million euros, or 2.5% of total OpEx and 27.7% of eligible OpEx.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Aligned turnover relating to hydrogen is  mostly  due  to  manufacturing  units with  a  low  carbon  footprint and  to sales of equipment  supporting the development of  new usages of hydrogen for the energy transition, in particular in the mobility sector. Aligned hydrogen turnover will increase as demand for low  carbon  footprint  hydrogen  increases,  supported by the deployment of policy and regulatory frameworks promoting new usages of hydrogen as a key lever to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors such as industry and transport.\n\nSecond to hydrogen activities, cogeneration activity represented 4.5% of total turnover. This activity supplies high grade heat to the chemical and  petrochemical  industry  in  an efficient manner and there is as of today no alternative at large scale; this activity is not deemed aligned with respect to the Taxonomy criteria. Air Liquide is assessing the technology options available to decarbonize heat production as part of the deployment of its climate objectives (described in paragraph 2.1 of the Extra-financial performance declaration, page 353).\n\nActivities covering biomethane production through both the anaerobic digestion of bio-waste and landfill gas capture and\n\nutilization  represented an eligible turnover of 100.6 million euros in 2022 whose alignment ratio represented 42.7%. In line with the Group sustainability  strategy, these projects  are  developed with clear sustainability criteria applied globally.\n\nOther Group activities ,  which  are in  a  growth phase, are  also eligible, such as the manufacture of low-carbon technologies with an eligible turnover representing 99.0 million euros and whose alignment ratio was 36.7%. The Engineering & Construction business line notably designs and builds treatment plants that are able to reduce the CO2 emissions of various industries, including:\n\n- \u25a0 carbon capture plants which capture and purify CO2 from offgas and flue gas from industrial processes (refining, cement, steel, etc.) to supply flow compatible with sequestration;\n- \u25a0 plants capable of converting residues (used cooking oil, fats, etc.) into synthetic fuels to replace fossil fuels in motors, and plants capable of transforming sugar waste into substitute chemicals for fossil-based chemicals.\n\nAs of today, a portion of these eligible activities is considered as non aligned due to insufficient evidence to comply precisely with the detailed requirement of the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nBesides,  the activities associated  with production of air gases, including the production of oxygen, medical gases and home healthcare, generate almost no direct greenhouse gas emissions and are not eligible to the EU Taxonomy.",

Ethical risk and combating corruption\n\nIn all  geographical  areas  in  which it  operates,  the Group  faces risks of non-compliance with ethics and anticorruption provisions. These risks are part of the Regulatory and Legal risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document, page 88).\n\n## 3.1.2.  Policy and procedures\n\nIntegrity and transparency are the cornerstones of the Group's ethical approach. They govern  the behaviors and  actions of all employees. These principles are reflected in a program based on a dedicated structure, codes and procedures, training tools and, finally, whistleblowing and control systems.\n\n## A dedicated structure\n\nA dedicated structure has been set up to support the management of the Ethics program:\n\n- \u25a0 an Ethics and Compliance Committee, comprised of Air Liquide's  various  global functions  (Human Resources,  Legal, Group Control and Compliance, Sustainable Development, etc.) and Operation representatives, validates  the program's guidelines and priority actions and may, if necessary, recommend penalties in the event of serious deviations;\n- \u25a0 the Group Control and Compliance Department, which is responsible  for Ethics, reports  directly to one  of  the  Group's Executive Vice Presidents;\n- \u25a0 the Ethics Officer is responsible for providing advice and assistance to entities in the implementation of the Ethics program and in the handling of fraud and deviations. This Officer also suggests improvements to the Ethics program by integrating strategic challenges, best practices, regulatory developments and annual action plans. He/she relies on a network of over 50 ethics  correspondents present in  each  of the Group's geographic regions and business lines.\n\n## Codes and procedures\n\nRules on ethics and conduct, which are shared and actively circulated  among  all Group employees through the  BlueBook in particular, are set out within the Group's Code of Conduct. These rules are  implemented as operational procedures or  policies  at either the Group or local level.\n\n## The Code of Conduct, the ethics guide for employees\n\nThe Code of Conduct was updated in 2021 and rolled out across all Group subsidiaries in 2022. This Code embodies Air Liquide's ethical commitment, in particular with regard to the protection of employees, business  practices  and respect for  the environment and human rights.\n\nThe Code of Conduct is available on the Group's website in  28 languages: An online employee training module exists on the employee Code of Conduct which sets out the Group's ethics approach and presents each subject through case scenarios. This module is mandatory and must be taken by all employees (including part-time staff) each year. On this basis, individual employee compliance with the Code of Conduct is required. https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ ethics.\n\nThus, each  employee  personally  undertakes  to  comply with  the rules of conduct presented in the Code through an online signature process.\n\n## Compliance with laws and regulations\n\nCodes and procedures have been established to ensure compliance with laws and regulations relating in particular to the fight against corruption, competition law, the duty of vigilance, personal data protection and import and export control obligations.\n\nWith regard to competition law, Behavior Codes have been established, especially in Europe, the United States and Asia. For some  of  the Group's activities,  Healthcare in  particular, specific Codes of Conduct on competition law have also been developed.\n\nAudits are jointly conducted  on a regular basis by the Group's internal audit departments and an external law firm. They conduct tests  and interviews to  identify  and  correct  risk  practices  or  any deviations observed. Awareness-raising meetings on compliance with competition law are also held. Finally, an online training program has been launched covering competition law-related practices and international principles.\n\n## Anti-corruption program\n\nAir  Liquide's  commitment,  which  is  set  out  in the  introduction  to the Principles of Action, to prohibit all forms of corruption is supported by a major anti-corruption program. In the updated Code of Conduct, the principles of integrity and transparency are defined and illustrated in a specific chapter. This chapter specifically outlines the laws governing the fight against corruption and  influence peddling, covers  relations  with  intermediaries and the types of payment requiring particular attention.\n\nMoreover, the Group has a Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes a chapter on the prevention of corruption.\n\nAn online training module ensures sufficient awareness is raised regarding the prevention of corruption. It is primarily intended for those  teams  which  are  most exposed to corruption-related  risks (sales, procurement, administrative management, and so on) and managers. These employees must complete this training module every  year.  It  is  supplemented  by  in-person training every  three years.  Air Liquide operates a corruption-prevention program in which Executive Management and management are closely involved. This program relies in particular on:\n\n- \u25a0 the mapping of corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 the Code of Conduct;\n- \u25a0 a complete  set of  training  and awareness-raising  actions for those exposed to corruption risks;\n- \u25a0 a third-party assessment mechanism, a whistleblowing system and accounting controls.\n\nThis program is regularly updated to take into account new regulatory and  legal  requirements  under the  coordination  of  the Group's Ethics Officer, who relies on a network of ethics correspondents and the support of the Operational Departments in the hubs and businesses; it is regularly audited.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Performance\n\nThe Ethics and  Compliance  Committee ensures that the  ethics program is correctly implemented by monitoring action plans and reviewing indicators such as employee participation rates in classroom training and online training courses. By way of illustration, 98% of Group employees completed the Code of Conduct online training module and 97 % of employees exposed to corruption risks completed the online training module on corruption prevention.\n\nThe Committee also analyses the corruption and report types received via the whistleblowing system and the results of internal audits or other internal investigations, providing guidelines for changes to the ethics program.\n\n## The whistleblowing system\n\nSince 2015, the Group has operated a whistleblowing system at all its entities (EthiCall for all Group companies excluding Airgas, and EthicsPoint for Airgas and its subsidiaries), whereby employees and external workers can anonymously send an alert to an independent external service provider. This system was made available to all of the company's partners (customers, suppliers, etc.) at the end of 2021.\n\nPolicy breaches may concern any:\n\n- \u25a0 conduct or situations that breach the Group's health and safety commitments;\n- \u25a0 serious human rights violations;\n- \u25a0 conduct or  situations that breach  the Group's environmental commitments;\n- \u25a0 deviations from the Code of Conduct.\n\nRegular communication (via posters, the intranet, e-learning reminders, management communications) ensures that all employees are familiar  with the  whistleblowing  system  and  can easily file an alert in their own language by telephone or through the provider's dedicated website. The Group guarantees that any whistleblower who reports something in good faith will not be penalized  and no retaliatory  measures  will  be  taken,  a principle which is reiterated in the Code of Conduct. Third parties are informed of the existence and operation of  the system on the Group's website.\n\nAll alerts are handled confidentially and within a reasonable period of time, usually less than two months. Alerts are handled by internal teams in accordance with their nature and geographical origin. Processing managers can utilize external resources if necessary. The most severe cases are reviewed by an Ethics  Committee for the relevant hub or general business area, or where necessary by the Group's Ethics and Compliance Committee. This system  complements other  means  of  reporting incidents within the entities (immediate supervisor, Human Resources Department, Legal Department, etc.). It enables alerts to be handled  quickly and  in a structured  way,  minimizing  their potential impact on individuals and the organization.\n\nThe whistleblowing system is overseen by the Group Ethics Officer, who ensures it is compliant in its implementation, and in particular  that  it is  properly  disseminated  throughout the  Group, alerts are handled appropriately, and whistleblowers are protected. He or she reports the key indicators and lessons learned  from  this  system  to  the  Group's Ethics  and Compliance Committee.\n\nIn 2022, 287 policy breaches were notified through the whistleblowing system, including:\n\n- \u25a0 discrimination and bullying: 129 cases;\n- \u25a0 other subjects linked to human resources: 29 cases\n- \u25a0 health, safety, and environmental violations: 25 cases;\n- \u25a0 fraud: 46 cases;\n- \u25a0 other: 58 cases.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, 66 alerts were still  being processed. 27% of policy breaches  were found  to  be justified following an investigation and led to sanctions and corrective measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF ALERTS PER NATURE (number / %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF ALERTS PER GEOGRAPHY (number / %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3.2. FIGHTING TAX EVASION\n\n## 3.2.1.  Risk of tax evasion\n\nAs far as tax is concerned, the Group focuses on complying with laws and  regulations.  Modifications of laws and regulations  are followed and monitored by its Tax Department and its local Finance Departments. Tax risks are part of the financial risks (described in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document on page 84).\n\n## 3.2.2.  Policy and procedures: the Tax Charter\n\nThe Group's tax Charter supports its ambition to remain a leader in its sector by acting in a responsible manner, consistent with the Group's long-term growth strategy.  Air Liquide has defined the following principles which govern its tax policy, in line with article L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code:",

        "page_content": "## Extra-financial Performance Declaration\n\n- a. Group entities must respect the laws and regulations in force, as  well  as  the international standards that  affect it  such  as those of the OECD, in particular on transfer prices;\n- b. Group entities ensure that tax returns and payments are completed in compliance with local regulations. They complete the required tax returns according to the jurisdictions in which the Group operates;\n- c. the Group is committed to acting with integrity in all taxrelated  matters. It aims to operate in  a  transparent  manner and build constructive, long-term relationships with the tax authorities;\n- d. the Group deals with tax-related matters by banning tax havens and does not make use of shell corporations without economic or commercial substance;\n- e. the Group protects value for its Shareholders by taking measures to minimize double taxation phenomena. Furthermore, it acts to minimize fiscal risk. Its tax strategy is in line with the Group's strategy and complies with the Code of Conduct.\n\nAir Liquide applies a tax compliance and transparency policy, guaranteed by the presence of qualified and dedicated teams of tax  experts who  are  up to date  with the  latest tax reforms and respect the Group's values. The Group is committed to acting with integrity in all tax-related matters. In the countries where it operates, the Group maintains transparent, constructive and longterm relationships with the tax authorities, providing them with the information they  need within  a  reasonable period  of time.  L'Air Liquide  S.A., on its  own  behalf and  on behalf of  its integrated French subsidiaries, is the first company to sign the 'Fiscal Partnership' with the French tax authorities. By signing this partnership in March 2019, L'Air Liquide S.A. and its subsidiaries entered into a trust-based, transparent relationship with the French tax authorities. This commitment continues without interruption.\n\nThe Group ensures that its operations comply with tax regulations, so that it pays an appropriate amount of tax according to  the place  where the  value  of  its business  activity  is  created, without artificially transferring value within low-tax jurisdictions.\n\nThe Group does not use opaque structures or entities in tax havens and does not withhold useful information from the tax authorities. It does not use structures that lack economic or commercial substance.\n\nIt  applies  the  arm's length  principle to  transfer  pricing  and  does not use  transfer pricing  as  a tax planning tool.  As the Group's organizational structure is decentralized, its intra-group transactions are very limited and do not represent more than 15% of total sales. The Group applies an intra-group cash flow policy that complies with the OECD principles.\n\nAir Liquide complies with the 'Country-by-Country Reporting' (CBCR) obligations.\n\n## 3.2.3.  Performance, organization and governance of the tax function\n\nThe subsidiaries' tax affairs are the responsibility of their Finance Departments. Due to their size, some subsidiaries have a specialized Tax Department reporting to the Finance Department, such as in France, the United States, Germany, China, Canada, Italy,  Benelux  and  Spain.  In  some  cases,  a geographic hub Tax Department reporting to the hub's Finance Department has been set up to coordinate taxation in several countries, such as in South-East Asia and Africa/Middle East.\n\nAll  these  country  or  regional Tax  Departments have a functional link with the Group's Tax Department, which is based at the head office. The latter coordinates the network of tax teams, in particular  through  regular  meetings  to  identify  significant issues, provide the appropriate technical support and the necessary guidance. As the Group's businesses make it a significant contributor to the tax revenues of the countries in which it operates, and since the Group is faced with  a high number  of taxes and duties, and certain countries have unstable tax regimes, the Tax Departments conduct a tax watch.\n\nThe Group Tax Department is part of the Group's Finance Department. It maintains links with the various financial, legal and other organizations in order to keep abreast of the Group's operations.  It  participates  in  the  Finance  Committee,  an  internal Group committee, to ensure the tax position complies with the Tax Charter. The Department presents the Group's main tax risks to the Audit and Accounts Committee at least once a year.\n\nIt should be noted that Air Liquide's industrial gas businesses are essentially very local in nature. Consequently, Air Liquide generates profit and pays its taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the case of transactions between different countries, the Air Liquide legal entities in question comply fully with the applicable transfer pricing regulations.\n\n## 4. Respect for human rights and commitment to sustainable development\n\nAir Liquide is committed to respecting human rights in its operations around the world. The Group strongly believes that all persons should be treated with respect and dignity and that companies should play a role in protecting these fundamental rights. Air Liquide shares the principles laid down in the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) as well as the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These promote an ethical and\n\nresponsible business conduct in economic activities and professional  relations,  in particular  in terms of human rights,  by encouraging the implementation of due diligence procedures. The commitments of Air Liquide and its employees to protect human rights are also confirmed in the Code of Conduct which was updated in 2021 and rolled out in all entities in 2022. The Code of Conduct is available on the Group's website in 28 languages: https://www.airliquide.com/sustainable-development/ethics.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The initiative calls on companies to make a voluntary public commitment to respect its Ten Principles relating to human rights, international labour standards, the environment and the fight against corruption. These are derived from the International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization's  Declaration  on  Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the United Nations Convention  against  Corruption.  Every  year, Air  Liquide issues  a Letter of Commitment, signed by the Group Chief Executive Officer, as well as a Communication on Progress with respect to the strategic and operational implementation of these Ten Principles, which is available on the UN Global Compact website: UN Global Compact ( https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/ participants/39281).\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide volunteered to join a group of 'Early Adopter' companies and answer the new questionnaire issued by the UN Global Compact on all aspects of sustainable development. This questionnaire must be  completed by the signatories  of the  UN Global Compact as their Communication on Progress in order for their commitment to be recognized from 2023 onwards.\n\nFurthermore, Air  Liquide  is  a  signatory  of  the Responsible Care Global Charter \u00ae of the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA), which aims to improve the chemical industry's global performance on health, safety and environmental protection.\n\nWithin Air Liquide, human rights issues are included in the Group's vigilance approach, described in the Vigilance Plan in Chapter 2 of this Universal Registration Document - page 95. The Duty of Vigilance Department is responsible for coordinating the implementation of this  approach  with  all  functions  concerned by human rights issues (Human Resources, Safety and Industrial System, Procurement, Sustainable Development, Ethics and Digital  Security, etc.).  The  progress of  the vigilance  approach  is monitored by the Ethics and Compliance Committee and supervised by the Environment and Society Committee, which is one of the Board of Directors' specialized Committees.\n\nThe vigilance approach is based on the approach advocated by international human  rights due diligence standards such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. In particular, Air Liquide identifies and analyzes the salient risks for people and the environment, the methodology of which is described on page 98.\n\nTherefore, Air Liquide incorporates  the various  principles of the UN  Global Compact in  the conduct  of  its activities.

APPROACH\n\nContributing to a sustainable future implies working with all stakeholders and sharing responsibilities openly, fairly, and responsibly. Air Liquide is committed to further improving its relationship with its stakeholders through transparency and a continuous and responsible dialog.\n\nStakeholder priorities are constantly evolving: for example, the Group carries out  formal materiality assessments on a  regular basis  to  identify  and  prioritize  issues  that  are  most  important  to stakeholders.\n\nThus, in 2020, the Group conducted a consultation of its stakeholders on Sustainable Development issues. The purpose of this matrix is to integrate the main risks and opportunities into the Group's strategy according to the importance attached to them by various stakeholders.\n\n21 issues covering environmental, social, societal, economic, Human Rights and governance aspects were consequently submitted for  consideration  by the  Group's  stakeholders.  Nearly 1,400 responses were received, compiled and analyzed to produce this materiality matrix of Air Liquide's sustainable development issues. This consultation will be updated regularly.\n\n## 1.2. METHODOLOGY\n\nAll  Group stakeholders were interviewed during this consultation in most of the geographical regions in which the Group operates: customers,  patient  associations, suppliers, investors,  journalists, NGOs, employee representatives, students and future generations, innovation partners, focus groups of employees and individual shareholders.\n\nThese stakeholders represented two categories of profiles:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's internal stakeholders with a strategic insight into topics;\n- \u25a0 internal and external stakeholders with operational knowledge of these topics.\n\nThe project was conducted over four months (from October 2020 to  January  2021) by  a  project team comprising members of the Group's Sustainable Development Department and a Steering Committee formed of representatives from operational and functional departments. A specialized firm was also appointed to support the internal teams for this project and carry out the various consultations.\n\nStakeholders were interviewed using two consultation methods:\n\n- \u25a0 individual qualitative interviews providing a more detailed insight and comments on the various issues and assigned rating;\n\n- \u25a0 online questionnaires to assess the importance and effectiveness of each issue, sent to a wider audience (e.g. employees).\n\nThese consultations were supplemented by analyses concerning extra-financial rating agencies, press reviews, studies of reporting standards such as TCFD or SASB, and the contribution of a foresight consultant to improve the way in which the Group's various issues and areas of action were presented and defined.\n\nThe results were then consolidated by giving equal weight to each stakeholder's assessments.\n\n## 1.3. RESULTS\n\nThe matrix shown below highlighted the following elements:\n\n- \u25a0 the  21  sustainable  development  issues  are  considered  to  be important by  stakeholders.  No question received  an average score of less than 2 on a scale of 1 to 4;\n- \u25a0 14 issues were assessed as major, with a wide consensus of support. Stakeholders recognize Air Liquide's commitment in these areas and their integration into Group strategy.\n\nIssues such as health and safety at work, ethics, quality of service to customers and climate change action were rated as very important by stakeholders, who also recognize the Group's achievements in these areas.\n\nThe issue relating to protection of the habitats and biodiversity is the only one  where the  various  stakeholders have  significantly differing  views. The Group has already identified the importance of this issue by addressing the biodiversity risk in the Extrafinancial Performance Declaration published in this Chapter (page 371) and by carrying out several actions, also described in the EFPD.\n\nCompared  to the  analysis carried  out previously, the  materiality matrix showed the emergence in 2020 of social issues or challenges that are largely taken into account in the Group's strategy:\n\n- \u25a0 adaptation to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions (page 353);\n- \u25a0 diversity and inclusion (page 399);\n- \u25a0 well-being and quality of life at work (page 398);\n- \u25a0 remuneration and social protection (page 398);\n- \u25a0 management of external  crises  (geopolitical  or health  crises, etc.) (page 88);\n- \u25a0 responsible finance and investment (page 407).\n\n<!-- image -->",

HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nAir Liquide brings 67,100 people together of more than 150 nationalities, in 73 countries (1) , who form multicultural teams with a host of skills.\n\nThe Group strives to promote diversity, encourage innovation and employee engagement, meet customers' expectations and guarantee Air Liquide's long-term performance.\n\nIn an environment undergoing profound transformation, Air Liquide  has  developed  a  Human Resources strategy  to  identify, attract, maintain and develop competent employees from all walks of life. This strategy is based on the following three priorities:\n\n- \u25a0 encouraging employee engagement;\n- \u25a0 developing an agile and collaborative structure;\n- \u25a0 anticipating the future of work.\n\n## GROUP HEADCOUNT\n\n2020 2019 2021 2022 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30,000\n\n## 2.2. EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1.  Employees' voices\n\nThere is a direct link between employee engagement and Group customer's satisfaction, which is at the heart of the Company program. Employee engagement is one of Human Resources' priorities. Air Liquide has launched a commitment monitoring measurement program,  My  Voice.  It  aims  to  improve employee experience and well-being. It is based on a simple concept: listen, understand and act. Following the launch of the initiative in Asia Pacific  in 2019, feedback  is gathered annually from employees across the entire Group to obtain a better understanding of their expectations and to identify and introduce appropriate measures and, as a result, significantly increase their engagement.\n\nA short survey covering some 20 topics is sent to each employee with room to leave comments if desired. The questions cover areas such as safety, work-life balance, career development, inclusiveness, independence, career development and trust in management. Answers are completely anonymous and confidential to ensure that  employees are free to  express  their thoughts. Results are collected in real time, aggregated and analyzed by means of a shared system for the entire Group. Each manager has access to the results from his or her team -provided that  the  thresholds needed to guarantee confidentiality are respected.\n\nSince its launch, this program has confirmed Air Liquide's strengths which contribute to employee commitment and identified opportunities, particularly in the context of the health crisis in order to provide appropriate responses as soon as possible.\n\nTargeted actions are launched at different levels in the organization: with managers and their employees to improve team dynamics, at the level of the entities by management teams, and at the Group level.\n\nAt this last level, the results of the program made it possible, for example, to:\n\n- \u25a0 implement initiatives to improve communication and education on the way the remuneration policy is constructed;\n- \u25a0 strengthen the sharing of information concerning the Group's major strategic orientations with all employees, which has notably been reflected in the communication about the ADVANCE strategic plan.\n\nThe results of the My  Voice survey  also confirmed the overall satisfaction of employees with the support provided by the Group during the covid-19 health crisis.\n\n## 2022 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SURVEY\n\nAir Liquide believes that it has a collective responsibility to build and shape a sustainable future. Two years after the announcement of the sustainable development objectives, the Group considers it important to gather feedback from employees on their understanding and engagement with sustainable development.\n\nIn December 2022, the Group launched an internal sustainability survey, reaching more than 78% of the Group population, to measure the interest of its employees in ESG thematic as well as their  personal  involvement  in  these  subjects. The  data  collected provides insight into the Group's strengths and especially, employees' belief that sustainability must be a top priority for Air Liquide.  The  survey also reflects opportunities for the  Group  to improve,  notably by providing  more information  and training  on sustainability topics. In 2023,  Air Liquide will launch actions to address employee feedback and increase sustainability-related engagement.\n\n## 2.2.2.  Mobility of skills development\n\nAir Liquide is  continuously looking  to recruit  diverse  profiles  to build multi-disciplined and complementary teams.\n\nThe Group's diversity is characterized by the fact that there is no 'standard  career path'.  On  the  contrary, each  employee  adapts their career path according to their individual goals and the career opportunities offered by the Group. Internal mobility and technical expertise are two major factors in career development.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Today, Air Liquide has more than 4,200 technical experts,  playing  a  driving  role in sharing expertise and technical excellence, serving our customers and patients.\n\nThis community of the Group's technology experts contributes to the transfer of technical know-how that Air Liquide will need in the future.\n\nAs part of this TCL program to identify technical talent, 143 new international experts were appointed in 2022, in our nine areas of expertise (Large Industries, Industrial Merchant, Healthcare, Electronics, Engineering & Construction, Innovation and Development Division, Industrial Operations & Security, IT & Digital, Hydrogen Mobility). TCL is a key driver of innovation and a major contributor to ensuring the long-term reliability and safety of our products and operations.\n\n## 2.2.3.  Employee performance and remuneration\n\nThe performance review meeting is a key stage in employee development, as it facilitates a discussion between the employee and their manager on performance and development, the assessment and setting  objectives  for  the  year  ahead.  In  2022, 78% of Group employees had a performance review meeting with their immediate supervisor.\n\nThe comprehensive remuneration of  Group  employees is  based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 the position held;\n- \u25a0 the degree of responsibility;\n- \u25a0 performance.\n\nIn  addition,  the  state  of  the  local  market,  pay  equity  and  current legislation are taken  into account. It is  generally made up  of  a basic salary plus additional compensation and benefits items.\n\nThe variable part of remuneration is structured locally for certain categories of employees to reward performance. In general, it depends on parameters such as the Group's earnings, the entity's earnings and individual performance, which is measured in quantitative and qualitative terms. By rewarding collective and individual performance, Air Liquide encourages collaboration and contribution to overall earnings.\n\nMost of the managers and professionals have variable pay, which includes sustainable development objectives.\n\nRemuneration may also include benefits such as death and disability insurance, health insurance, profit-sharing (2) or solutions to help balance work and family life, which vary by country.\n\nIn 2022, 59%  of the  Group's employees  received an  individual variable portion as part of their remuneration.\n\n15% of managers' variable remuneration is linked to sustainable development criteria, such as safety, customer satisfaction, energy efficiency and equality.\n\n(2)\n\nFinally, the top 375 Group executives have a significant portion of their variable remuneration linked to these criteria, notably safety, as well as to the Corporate Sustainability Program targets for their entity.\n\nDespite the covid-19 crisis, the Group has maintained its remuneration policy commitments.\n\n## 2.2.4.  Transformation of the working environment\n\nThe Group ensures that it builds a performance-focused, attractive and collaborative work environment while also safeguarding  the health  and well-being of Group employees in their workplace.\n\nThese practices were incorporated into principles that were jointly developed with European social partners. In 2019, the Group partnered with the European Works Council to develop the 'Care and Perform' initiative, whose purpose is to prevent psychosocial risks. This led to the creation of a charter based on principles of action linked to improvements in work scheduling, workloads and work-life balance. The content of this charter facilitated the conclusion of  company agreements with social partners in order to offer new services to employees. In several European countries, agreements on the right to disconnect and work remotely have been concluded to meet specific needs and support the transition toward new working conditions.\n\nMore generally, within the context of changes to the Group's organizational models, which were  accelerated by the  covid-19 pandemic, Air  Liquide launched a global  project  in  2020  called 'Next Normal' to support this shift in working organization.\n\nWith this project, the entities can provide their employees with:\n\n- \u25a0 a new framework including team management;\n- \u25a0 a supervised remote working policy;\n- \u25a0 reorganization of workspaces;\n- \u25a0 careful consideration of interactions with customers and patients;\n- \u25a0 a new framework for Air Liquide's responsible travel policy.\n\n## Common Social Coverage\n\nAs part of the ADVANCE objectives announced in 2022, Air Liquide's aim is to ACT FOR ALL by engaging with employees. On this  occasion, the Group renewed its  commitment to offering  a common basis of care coverage to all employees by 2025.\n\nThis care coverage will guarantee:\n\n- \u25a0 an  insurance with a  compensation equivalent  to one year's salary in the event of death;\n- \u25a0 healthcare that includes inpatient and outpatient care;\n- \u25a0 a minimum of 14 weeks paid maternity leave.\n\nFrom May to September 2021, entities were grouped by country so that gaps in their current coverage could be assessed and a plan devised to phase in upgrades by 2025.\n\nIn 2022, the percentage of employees benefiting from this common basis of care coverage is 42%.\n\nA special team was set up within the Human Resources Department to oversee the plan's roll-out and measure progress within  the  Group  on  an  annual  basis.  In  addition,  in  2022,  each hub has drawn up a 2023-2025 roadmap to achieve the target set.",

To encourage this even further among its 67,100 employees, the Group has created the Citizen at Work program, with the aim of giving employees the means to act and increasing its collective  impact. This  initiative, launched at the  beginning of 2022 with  a  pilot  phase,  provides guidelines for entities to deploy local volunteering initiatives for all employees. It will be gradually rolled out across the entire Group to  reach  100% of entities by  2025. At the  end  of  2022,  43%  of Group employees already had access to this program. Each project  identified  as  part  of this  new  initiative  is  in  line with  Air Liquide's sustainable development objectives and enables employees to get involved in areas such as professional development, child education, environmental protection, healthcare and social inclusion.\n\nExamples of program initiatives carried out in 2022:\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide France Industrie employees were involved in preparing 750 meals for distribution to  disadvantaged people in the Paris region;\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide employees in South Korea supported students throughout the year as part of a mentoring program called 'ALTogether';\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide USA employees took part in cleaning up a bayou in the  Houston area, as part of the 'Clean It  Like  You  Mean  It' Trash Bash operation.\n\n## 2.2.5. Legal working hours\n\nEach Group entity defines, in agreement with representative bodies and in line with local regulations, legal working hours which encourage engagement and performance.\n\nIn addition  to the regulations,  the European 'Care & Perform' principles and rules are also designed to organize work in a way that respects the autonomy, flexibility and private life of each employee.\n\nTo facilitate the deployment of the 'Next Normal' project, Air Liquide  developed a reference  guide in 2021. First  shared with managers, the guide helps the entities to set up new working methods based on the initial  global  experience.  Working  groups were then organized with employees in the entities to validate the commitments.\n\nIn France, the general framework of legal working hours is defined in agreements with the labor unions.\n\nMeanwhile, the industrial businesses, as well as those in Healthcare, include on-call  systems  that  are  regularly  discussed and are subject to agreements with the labor unions.\n\n## 2.2.6.  Renewing social dialog\n\nAir  Liquide  is  committed to meaningful  social dialog  in  all of its subsidiaries. This comes in different forms according to local regulations. In 2022, 86% of Group employees had access to  a representation, dialog or consultation structure.\n\nIn Europe, the European Works Council has 29 employee representatives from 12 countries. It was renewed in 2021 for a term of four years. In 2022, two plenary meetings were held under the chairmanship of a member of the Executive Committee, and an exceptional plenary meeting was held  to  provide  information and consult on the Human Resources process transformation project and the roll-out of the new tool in Europe. This project is part of a Group project.\n\nFive meetings of the Bureau of the European Works Council (composed of five members elected in plenary) were held during the  year  to  ensure  information  and  listening  on  various  projects and topics of interest affecting several countries in Europe. A number of meetings were held remotely and others face-to-face at key sites such as Lisbon and Krakow.\n\nIn  April, the Chairman's report  was issued as stipulated in the Council's agreement. The main topics covered were the presentation  of the  new  Group  version  of the  Code  of Conduct, the  Group's  annual  results and  more  particularly in  Europe,  the extra-financial results (safety, reliability, turnover, training, diversity,  etc.),  the presentation  of  the new ADVANCE strategic plan, security and safety.\n\nAnother  important achievement  was the  finalization of the  work initiated  in 2021  resulting  in  a  reference  manual  on new hybrid working methods ('Next Normal' project); the subject continues to be monitored by a working group.\n\nAt the end of the year, a presentation on the Duty of Vigilance was shared with the European Works Council and, on this occasion, the  results of the working group dedicated  to dealing with the Group's salient risks were presented.\n\nFiscal years 2020 and 2021 were in large part devoted to managing the pandemic crisis together with employee representatives. They were characterized by continuous and strengthened social dialog with  bodies such as the Social and Economic Council (CSE), the Group  Committee, the European Committee and the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Commission (CSSCT).\n\n## 2.3. AN AGILE AND COLLABORATIVE STRUCTURE\n\nThe second focus of the Human Resources strategy consists of building an agile and collaborative structure capable of addressing the challenges  of a continuously changing  world. This requires facilitating cross-divisional exchanges within Group's teams to ensure sustainable performance.\n\n## 2.3.1.  Inclusion and diversity\n\nDiversity is a priority of Air Liquide's Human Resources strategy and policy and the Group considers it a source  of dynamism, creativity and performance. It is a fundamental element  of the organization, in terms  of both businesses and employees, and drives the Group's long-term performance.\n\nThe Group's objective is to increase diversity among managerial staff to better recognize  the various  cultures that make up  Air Liquide and to improve gender equality. In this respect, quantified gender  equality targets  have been  set  for  the  Group. The local entities took an inventory of the current situation to define an objective at  the level  of the  clusters and  thus contribute to the overall objective.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nWithin the Human Resources organization, a team leads diversity projects. The roadmap is based on three criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 deploy diversity objectives at in all entities and implement corresponding action plans;\n- \u25a0 improve all  of the Group's Human Resources processes to reduce any bias and avoid all forms of discrimination;\n- \u25a0 promote an inclusive culture to leverage teams' diversity.\n\nEach hub  and  business then  implements its  own  roadmap and diversity action plans taking the local situation into consideration. In this context, they analyze processes and practices, identify potential biases and implement corrective measures ('nudges') to limit these biases. Thus, during the regular reviews of talents with high potential, the diversity of profiles is taken into account, with the aim of continuing to increase diversity in the Group's key positions. This also serves as a way to promote the many cultures present within the Group, and to strengthen gender equality.\n\nAt an entity level, the Group's objective is to have teams comprising employees  who  represent the  environment in which they operate. Each entity is therefore responsible for implementing action plans specific to its own environment and legal framework, which may include many forms of diversity (skin color,  ethnic  origin,  religion,  sexual  orientation,  etc.). Through  its diversity  policy, Air  Liquide  is  strongly  committed to  fighting  any form of discrimination.\n\n## 2.3.2.  Gender\n\nThe Group has set a number of ambitious gender equality objectives, aimed at reaching a rate of:\n\n- \u25a0 35%  women at the 'Managers and Professionals' level, by 2025. These  objectives are in line with  the results obtained over the past ten years, which have seen the share of female 'Managers and Professionals' within the Group increase from 26% to 31.5% (3) ;\n- \u25a0 25% of executive positions (senior executives) held by women by 2025.\n\n## PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AMONG MANAGERS AND PROFESSIONALS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (a) Including Airgas since 2017.\n- (b) The share of women among \"Managers and Professionals\" is rounded off in increments of 0.5%.\n- (c) Including Airgas since 2016.\n\nThe ambitious gender diversity objectives set for the 'Managers and Professionals' and 'senior executives' population, and for maintaining the gender diversity goal among 'high potentials', are also intended to form a pool to ensure balanced gender representation on the Executive Committee by promoting female talents to higher levels of management. Moreover, in view of the new obligations laid down by the 'Rixain' Law of December 24, 2021, the Group is also aligning its gender equality objectives with\n\nregard to the Executive Committee with those of the Law, i.e. 30% of women by March 1, 2026.\n\nIn 2022, women represented 47%  of  employees considered  as high performers, this  level has been increasing regularly for a number of years and must be maintained. The Executive Committee includes four women among its 14 members.\n\nMore generally, and taking the highest level of responsibilities across the Group into account, women hold 24.8% of all positions defined as 'senior executives,' . This latter percentage has increased from 19% to 24.8% over the last four years.\n\nAmong the 10% of positions with the greatest level of responsibility within the company (4) L'Air  Liquide  S.A.,  28.4%  of them are held by women. These women have an average age of 52.6 years and a median age of 55.6 years, i.e. 3.2 and 0.8 years less respectively than the average age (55.8 years) and median age (56.4 years) for  men. This difference is due to the policy to promote women to the highest levels of responsibility earlier on in their careers, and therefore eliminate career development discrepancies that occur in the absence of proactive measures in this area.\n\nFinally, the promotion of an inclusive culture also contributes to a sustainable approach to diversity. Numerous initiatives are deployed within the Group: events, learning opportunities, mentoring, networks and communities for different interest groups such as women's careers. Another recent example is the second edition  of the movement for inclusion,  which  is a development opportunity for committed employees. For seven months, 220 of these 'Inclusion & Diversity enthusiasts' designed and carried out experiments across the Group using innovative methods to promote inclusion in the work environment. These new approaches are disseminated throughout the organization in a spirit of continuous improvement.\n\n## Gender and equal pay\n\nIn France, the law of September 5, 2018, known as the 'Loi avenir professionnel,' requires companies with more than 50 employees to implement an annual mechanism for assessing gender pay gaps, the result of which is a public social score for the Company (out of 100 points). The Professional Equality Index and five related indicators must also be made available to the Social and Economic Committee and transmitted to the Labor administration.\n\nIn 2022, the Group's 30 companies with at least 50 employees in France were audited. The weighted average Professional Equality Index stands at 90.5/100, maintaining the trend compared to 2019, 2020 and 2021. The company L'Air Liquide S.A. published its fifth annual Professional Equality Index, which reached 97/100.\n\nOutside of France, the Group initiated a common process to assess the gender pay gap by creating an internal index based on the French index but tailored to Air Liquide's global presence. It was deployed for the first time in 2019 for entities with more than 400 employees.\n\nThis index from the year 2021 onwards is calculated on the basis of the weighting of four criteria:\n\n- \u25a0 pay  gapbetween women  and  men,  using the median salary per job grade;\n- \u25a0 individual wage  increase  gap  between  women and men  per job grade;\n- \u25a0 percentage of employees  having  received a salary increase after a maternity leave;\n- \u25a0 gender diversity among the 10 highest remunerations.\n\n2022",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nFor the year 2021, the scope of the index has been expanded to include entities with more than 200 employees, and the calculation method has been revised. The changes made, including the  use  of  median  salary  and job  classification  aim  to obtain a more accurate result.\n\nThe result of the 2021 index, calculated in 2022, is 75/100 based on 74% coverage of  the  Group's  employees  (entities with  more than 200 employees), while the result of the 2020 index was 82/100 for  a scope covering 61% of the workforce (entities with more than 400  employees).  The lower score in  2022 is due in particular to the expansion of the index to entities with more than 200 employees, thus including countries with greater social disparities. An action plan has been deployed:\n\n- \u25a0 part of the 'Merit Increase' budget was allocated to filling wages gaps;\n- \u25a0 awareness workshops with HR population were organized.\n\n## 2.3.3.  Age\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF EMPLOYEES BY AGE BRACKET IN 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDistribution of employees by age bracket\n\nThe Group is committed to fostering better qualifications and training programs  for  young people  to  facilitate their  integration into the workplace.\n\nInternship and apprenticeship contracts are encouraged. In France, 557 young people have benefited from work-study contracts and 468 from an internship, combining theoretical learning at their university or school and a practical internship at Air Liquide.\n\nSeniors will represent an increasing share of Air Liquide employees in  the coming  years.  Their  contribution  to  mentoring programs  (notably the  Technical Community Leaders program), and training programs aimed at younger generations will be further promoted.\n\nVarious initiatives have been introduced within the Group to ensure the support and engagement of employees nearing retirement age. For example, in France:\n\n- \u25a0 26 people became skills sponsors following the pilot launched in France in 2018;\n- \u25a0 'generation / youth-employment contracts' were continued. They include  initiatives promoting the  hiring and  retention  of older employees.\n\nThe Group  has  international exchange  programs to  attract and develop  young  talents: the ALLEX  programs for  executives and EVE for technicians (more than 600 people since they were set up).\n\n## 2.3.4.  Nationality\n\nThere are 35 different nationalities among Air Liquide's senior managers. The Group's Board of Directors comprises four nationalities. In terms of total employees, more than 150 different nationalities are employed by the Group.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF EMPLOYEES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.3.5.  Disability\n\nLaunched in 2017 at the European level, the HandivAirsity initiative  aims to encourage  diversity by integrating people with disabilities into teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our differences make our performance.' This  slogan  carries  a strong conviction. The inclusion of disabilities is fully in line with the policy to promote diversity within Air Liquide.\n\nThis desire is not new, it has been embodied since 2007 in successive agreements in France which have advanced the policy of welcoming, maintaining and promoting the professional development of people with disabilities. Air Liquide is committed to finding  solutions  to  keep disabled  people  in  the workplace. The following adjustments are planned to accommodate for disabilities in the workplace:\n\n- \u25a0 ergonomic studies and adaptation of the workstation with regard to the capacities of the person;\n- \u25a0 specific equipment and tools;\n- \u25a0 adaptation of methods of access to work premises and specific training services;\n- \u25a0 transportation and moving assistance.\n\nAir  Liquide  makes teams aware of the inclusion of disabilities in order to facilitate the reception and professional integration of workers with disabilities in the Company. The French subsidiaries have awareness-raising plans in order to strengthen the level of information for all  players and fight  against  any prejudices that may persist. In 2022, a  survey of employees  in  a selection  of French entities was carried out in order to gain a better understanding of the obstacles to the inclusion of people with disabilities in the teams and thereby determine appropriate actions. The results of this survey will be shared more widely with the European disability coordinators. The French entities participate in particular in DuoDay, a day where they welcome a person with a disability paired with a volunteer professional.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The aim of this agreement is to continue with measures already implemented in favor of people with disabilities and thus further improve the direct employment  rate  to  reach  4.2% in  2022  vs. 3.3% in  2018.  The 2021 rate, calculated in April 2022, is 4.43% (4.35% in 2020). Negotiations with the labor unions began in late 2022 for the signature of a sixth Disability agreement for the 2023-2025 period.\n\nMore widely in Europe, other concrete actions were also carried out to change the way disability is seen in operations and accelerate the pace of recruitment: campaign ambassadors, and a working group with managers.\n\n## 2.3.6.  Network organization\n\nAir Liquide has a decentralized organizational structure which relies on its  hubs and  clusters (groups of countries or  entities). This network structure  on a global scale is more agile,  fosters initiative and strengthens proximity with customers.\n\nA collaborative work platform called 'Kite' has been launched throughout the Group. Kite is changing every year to offer its users new services. Thus, the Group offers employees the opportunity to set up and access communities hosted in internal collaborative communication software (Google Currents) accessible from the Kite collaborative platform. These communities rally employees on subjects: expertise, tools, events, procedures, shared interests, etc. They transform working methods by fostering flexibility, efficiency, diversity and collective intelligence.\n\nThis network structure  and collaborative platform have  made it possible, during this pandemic crisis, to maintain an efficient working structure and connections between employees.\n\n## 2.4. ANTICIPATING THE 'FUTURE OF WORK'\n\nThe 'Future of Work' cornerstone focuses on identifying the business lines and skills of the future. To do so, the Human Resources teams must understand and anticipate trends that are likely to transform our business.\n\n## 2.4.1.  Business lines and skills\n\nThe aim is to implement an efficient action plan to help employees evolve at the same pace as their business line. To support each employee in this new technological environment, Air Liquide University has developed:\n\n- \u25a0 a Sales Academy, which was set up to strengthen key skills in the  Group's business lines. Over 4,364 employees have had the opportunity to develop, thanks to the academy. In 2022, for the purpose of continuity of training, the majority sessions were held virtually; the translation of the modules into a dozen languages, initiated in 2021, continued in 2022. More than 40% of training courses were conducted in the local language;\n- \u25a0 a 'digital passport', which consists of several self-assessment questionnaires on digital culture in general, but also on knowledge of Kite (the Group's collaborative work platform);\n- \u25a0 data challenges have also been held. These competitions make it possible to share data skills quickly while creating value.\n\n## 2.4.2.  Career-long training and development\n\nAir Liquide takes special care to develop its employees' skills and expertise  throughout  their  careers.  Several ways of learning are provided. Everyone must be proactive in this regard.\n\nIn 2022, the  percentage of  Group  employees who had  at  least one day of training during the year was 74%; this excludes regulatory training.\n\nThe online training offering is upgraded year by year and covers many topics such as safety, ethics, Human Resources processes, management, and, more recently, digital technology.\n\nA new online self-learning package (#ILoveLearning) was deployed in 2019 as part of a pilot by Air Liquide University. Since then, over 25,644 employees have used this self-service training.\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF TRAINING TOPICS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough its programs and structure, the University, which celebrated its 10 th anniversary in 2019, supports the Group's strategic  initiatives  and promotes the Air Liquide  culture.  Today, the University is present at a Group level and globally promotes new ways of learning, in both traditional and non-traditional ways. As  such, the  Company's various businesses  and  functions  can access tools to design their own programs.\n\nModern teaching  methods are  coupled  with  formal and  informal skills, online training, lessons, support, mentoring, codevelopment, etc. The programs are as practical and relevant as possible, and use role play, mock exercises, workshops, case studies, guided discussions and various feedback mechanisms.\n\nFollowing the health crisis, the digital transformation of many business lines and increased training for employees, the University has once again in 2022 launched a virtual event and a Learning Festival open to the entire Group, which revolve around six themes: Management & Leadership, Sales & Marketing, Operational Excellence, Innovation, Climate & Energy Transition and HR professionals. This has resulted in 4,230 employees logged  in  to over  220 online  sessions:  webinars, virtual classes and learning paths.",

The  120  internal  facilitators and  51  creators  of  minitutorials  passed  on  their knowledge to the  2,500  participants in more than 100 sessions and 45 microlearning videos.\n\nAs part of the BeActEngage - Trust and Grow program, the Group provides employees with the means to learn throughout their career. As a learning company, Air Liquide also encourages employees to pass on their knowledge and learn from each other, and peer-to-peer learning is an excellent opportunity to broaden their skills.\n\nThese events have, firstly, promoted interactions within the Group thanks to participants from 72 countries and, secondly, revealed employees' creative and teaching abilities:\n\nAmong the University's programs, those on management and leadership cover all modern management situations, thereby promoting the use of a shared language at a Group level. These programs help managers understand the increasingly volatile and complex world around them and provide the Group with the relevant expertise to maintain its leadership position over the long term.\n\n## 3. Shareholders: a long-term relationship\n\n## More than 64% of shareholders have owned their shares for more than 10 years .\n\nShareholders have been contributing to and supporting the Group's growth since its creation. During the 2016 acquisition of Airgas, they once again confirmed their commitment to the Group's development through large-scale involvement in the capital increase in cash with Preferential subscription right. Today, it  is  thanks to their loyal support that Air Liquide can continue to change and grow. Air Liquide's long-term profitable growth strategy and its commitment to its Shareholders are therefore closely linked. By promoting individual share ownership, through\n\nvarious measures in place and by offering Shareholders the expertise of its dedicated department, Air Liquide fosters a close relationship based on dialog with its Shareholders on a daily basis which focuses on the following key principles:\n\n- \u25a0 promoting long-term share investment;\n- \u25a0 encouraging shareholder loyalty through registered shares and the establishment of loyalty bonus policy;\n- \u25a0 promoting dialog and meetings, whether face-to-face or digital;\n- \u25a0 recognizing and promoting the Shareholder's key role.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2022)\n\n|                                         | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   |     | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |     |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|\n| Individual shareholders                 | 36%    | 37%    | 36%    | 33%    |     | 32%    | 32%    | 32%    | 33%    | 33%    | 35%    | (b) |\n| French institutional investors          | 19%    | 17%    | 18%    | 20%    | (a) | 19%    | 18%    | 17%    | 16%    | 15%    | 14%    |     |\n| Non-French institutional investors      | 45%    | 46%    | 46%    | 47%    | (a) | 49%    | 50%    | 51%    | 51%    | 52%    | 51%    |     |\n| Treasury shares                         | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   |     | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   | > 0%   |     |\n| Registered capital                      | 36%    | 35%    | 36%    | 33%    |     | 34%    | 35%    | 34%    | 34%    | 34%    | 35%    |     |\n| Capital eligible for the loyalty  bonus | 30%    | 30%    | 30%    | 26%    |     | 25%    | 26%    | 28%    | 28%    | 28%    | 28%    |     |\n\n- (a) In 2016, the proportion of institutional investors in the Group's capital increased due to their over-subscription to the capital increase.\n\nAir Liquide is regularly recognized for the quality of its relationship with Shareholders. In 2022, at the 21 st edition of the Investor  Awards organized by Boursorama,  the Group  received the Shareholder Democracy award  for the  second consecutive year. The company also received the bronze trophy for the best shareholder services in the CAC 40 awarded by Le Revenu.\n\nThe Chairman is directly involved in the General Meeting, as well as in events with Shareholders such as the 'post-General Meeting' conference held in Lille on May 12, 2022 or the ' G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Hydrog\u00e8ne' show. He also chairs the Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC).\n\n## 3.1. A STEADY LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE AND AN ATTRACTIVE REMUNERATION POLICY\n\nSince its initial public offering in 1913,  Air Liquide has always shown a profit and shared the fruits of its growth by rewarding its Shareholders' trust through a remuneration and loyalty policy based on regular dividend  distribution,  allocation  of  free  shares, and a loyalty bonus program.  As a result, more than 50% of earnings over the last 10 years have been distributed to Shareholders.\n\n## 3.2. CUSTOMIZED SERVICES\n\nThe Shareholder Services Department, with more than 40 employees and experts, is dedicated to Air Liquide's Shareholders.\n\nAir Liquide is at the disposal of all its Shareholders, whether individual or institutional, 'bearer' or 'registered' shareholders, to inform them and support them. In addition to its steady performance and remuneration policy,  Air Liquide promotes the registration of shares in order to enhance the value of the investment in shares and build long-term Shareholder loyalty.\n\nIn 2017, the Shareholder Services Department launched its 'Shareholder Journey' approach to continue strengthening the quality of service to Shareholders. This global approach of listening closely  to  Shareholders and  their  expectations  aims  to make administrative formalities more fluid by offering more personalized services, ensuring better and wider circulation of strategy and financial information, for example with live broadcasts  of  events  for Group  Shareholders.  The  latest  digital tools are also at the heart of this initiative, as they provide a formidable lever for multiplication and personalization.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Registered Shareholder services\n\nRegistered shares are eligible for a loyalty bonus: to thank Shareholders for their loyalty, they are eligible for a loyalty bonus after  holding their shares in registered form for two full calendar years. They receive a +10% increase in the amount of dividends paid and +10% more free shares  distributed during free share attributions. Shareholders who hold their shares in registered form automatically  benefit  from  the  loyalty  bonus  and  do  not need to take any action. The only requirement is that they have held their shares in registered form for more than two calendar years on the day the dividend is paid or on the day the free shares are attributed.\n\nAir Liquide is the only CAC 40 non-banking company which keeps managing internally all aspects of its shares on behalf of both its 123,000 Shareholders who hold their shares directly with Air Liquide ('direct registered') and the 181,000 Shareholders who choose to deposit their shares in a Bank, while being known to the Company ('administered registered'): account keeping, register keeping, centralization of the General Meeting. It does not charge custodial or management fees. Broker fees are among the lowest on the market at 0.1% excluding VAT for transactions made online in the Shareholder Portal and paid for by bank card or direct debit. For transactions settled by other forms of payment in  the Shareholder Portal or for stock  market orders placed  by another means of communication  (e.g. telephone call  or online request), broker fees are 0.18%. These broker fees apply, with no minimum purchase or sale, from the first share purchased or sold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DIFFERENT SHAREHOLDING OPTIONS\n\n## Hold shares through a financial institution: default option, 'bearer'\n\nThe shareholder holds a security account or share savings plan (in French Plan d'Epargne en  Actions or PEA ) with his  or her financial institution. The shares are held in 'bearer' form and the Shareholder's contact is his or her financial institution.\n\n## Hold shares through a financial institution: shares converted to 'administered registered' shares\n\nThe Shareholder holds a security account or a PEA with his or her financial institution. He or she should ask his or her financial institution to convert  his  or  her  'bearer'  shares to 'administered registered'  shares.  'Administered  registered' shares are  eligible for the loyalty bonus and are registered in his or her name in the Air Liquide register. The Shareholder's contact person remains his or her financial institution.\n\n## Hold shares directly with Air Liquide: 'direct registered' form\n\nThe Shareholder holds a securities account directly with Air Liquide without using a financial institution. His or her shares are registered in his or her name in the Air Liquide register and are eligible for the loyalty bonus. As a reminder, it is impossible to open a PEA or to convert shares from a PEA to 'direct registered' shares. The Shareholder's contact person is the Shareholder Services team.\n\n## 3.2.2.  Innovation for the benefit of Shareholders\n\nIn 2020, Air Liquide set up a 100% digital security account: from the website, in a few minutes and free of charges,  an individual can directly  open  a  'direct registered' security account by including digital supporting documentation. Opening a securities account online has met with great success and has become the preferred way to directly open a securities account with Air Liquide ('direct registered'). https://www.airliquide.com/\n\nThe information documents dedicated to Shareholders  such as the Shareholders' Fact Sheets, the Shareholders'  Guide or the Notice of General Meeting are drawn up with a particular focus on education. Comic strips have been created and are sent to junior Shareholders via their legal representatives; they help explain shareholding and present the Group's activities. Air Liquide also publishes, in the month after the event, a report on its General Meeting, which is available at In addition, more frequent e-mails on major strategic events, such as the announcement of the sustainability objectives, have also allowed to reach our individual Shareholders more directly and maintain the connection with them. An exclusively digital monthly newsletter presents topics of importance to Shareholders, whether it be Shareholder education or  topics  related  to  the Group's activity  (hydrogen, biomethane, space, etc.). https:// www.airliquide.com/.\n\nAn FAQ is online on the website, under the Shareholders section; it covers key topics for Shareholders and presents the  most  frequently  asked  questions with short and practical answers. https://www.airliquide.com/\n\nShareholders who hold shares with Air Liquide ('direct registered' Shareholders) have access to a secure online Shareholder Portal that allows them to place stock market orders online and to view the transactions carried out on their securities account. The ergonomics of this Shareholder Portal were redesigned in 2022; it now provides a more intuitive experience and new functionalities. It  also  offers  one  of  the lowest  brokerage  rates  on  the market: 0.1% excluding VAT, with no minimum transaction.\n\nShareholders also have access to  the  new  Shareholder  Lounge inaugurated on November 23, 2022 in the presence of the Chairman, Beno\u00eet Potier, and the Chief Executive Officer, Fran\u00e7ois Jackow. This space showcases Air Liquide to Shareholders. It promotes Sustainable Development with the choice of new furniture based on its origin, recyclability, recycled content and environmental impact. The previous furniture was recycled or donated. This space, unique in the CAC 40, provides Shareholders or people looking for information on Air Liquide shares with  the ability  to talk  face-to-face  with the  Shareholder Relations Advisors. Located at the Company's head office at 75, Quai d'Orsay, 75007 in Paris, it welcomes Shareholders from Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Shareholders are advised to make an appointment online from our website before any visit.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nAir Liquide manages a Shareholders' Communication Committee (SCC). Composed of 12 Shareholders, the SCC generally meets three times a year under the Chairmanship of the Chairman and enables rich discussions with these Shareholder representatives. It is regularly consulted on matters relating to communication with Shareholders. This year, the SCC welcomed eight new members for a three-year term. A committee member is part of the Air Liquide Foundation's Project  Selection Committee. In 2022, the Shareholders' Communication Committee met three times, chaired by Beno\u00eet Potier.\n\n## 3.2.3.  The General Meeting, the expression of Shareholder democracy\n\nEach year, all Air Liquide Shareholders who hold at least one share are invited to the General Meeting. They receive all the documentation relating to their vote approximately one month before the General Meeting, either by mail or by email in the case of Shareholders who have opted for this means of communication.  In  accordance  with  the principle  of  Shareholder equality to which Air Liquide is very committed, each share entitles its owner to one vote. Air Liquide endeavors to make all this material available in English to its non-French-speaking Shareholders in similar timeframes. Air Liquide centralizes its General Meeting by collecting the votes of its Shareholders directly and offers voting by Internet.\n\nIn 2022, the Air Liquide General Meeting was a time for reunion. Following the 2020 and 2021 General Meetings held behind closed doors due to the health constraints, it allowed Shareholders to be welcomed in person once again. This marks an important year with a change in governance within the Group: Beno\u00eet Potier remains Chairman  of the Board of Directors and Fran\u00e7ois Jackow was  appointed  Chief  Executive Officer. It was the occasion for the new strategic plan for 2025, ADVANCE, to be presented.\n\nAir Liquide is already working, and will continue to work, with banks and specialized service providers of all kinds to identify and introduce reliable and secure solutions to enable all Shareholders to participate in the General Meeting, both at the physical place of meeting and remotely, before and during the Meeting, in accordance with legal rules.\n\n## THE SHAREHOLDER DEPARTMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn line with the Group's objective to contribute to a more sustainable world,  Air Liquide encourages its shareholders to receive their documents electronically (account documents, General Meeting voting documents, etc.). If they wish, Shareholders may request that these various documents be sent by post.\n\n## 3.3. RECOGNIZING AND PROMOTING THE SHAREHOLDER'S KEY ROLE\n\nAir Liquide is committed to defending individual Shareholding and promoting investment in shares, a real challenge for society with a strong increase in the number of individual Shareholders observed since the health crisis of 2020. The Group has supported initiatives such as those of the ANSA (Association nationale des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s par actions), the Observatoire des Actionnaires d'Avenir and the F2iC (the French Federation of Individual  Investors and Investment Clubs), which contributed to the creation of the 'PEA Jeunes', a young person's personal equity plan under the PACTE law.\n\n## 3.4. 2022 STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL SHAREHOLDER RETURN\n\nIn 2022, the stock market performance of Air Liquide's shares was down -5.01% (vs. a -9.50% decrease for the CAC 40). Taken over a three-year period, including 2020 which was the pandemic year, the stock market performance of Air Liquide's shares was up +15.40% (vs. +8.29% for the CAC 40).\n\nThere have  been  31 free share attributions since 1962, i.e.  an average of one free share award every two years.\n\nAs  of  December  31, 2022, the  overall financial  performance of the  Air  Liquide  share,  i.e. the  rate  of  return  on invested capital, or Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (1) , remains well above the performance of its benchmark index:\n\n## END OF 2022 DATA\n\n| TSR                           | 5 years   | 10 years   | 20 years   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|------------|------------|\n| Air Liquide registered shares | +11.54%   | +10.67%    | +11.69%    |\n| Air Liquide bearer shares     | +11.22%   | +10.21%    | +11.12%    |\n| CAC 40 reinvested dividends   | +6.97%    | +9.18%     | +7.21%     |\n\n## 3.5. 2022 INITIATIVES\n\n## 3.5.1.  Individual Shareholders\n\nIndividual Shareholders have been contributing to and supporting the Group's growth since its creation. Shareholders' trust and loyalty  are  key  to Air  Liquide's  growth.  For  more than a century, the Group has been dedicated to involving them in its growth and has fostered a long-term relationship based on transparency, dialog and proximity.\n\nAt the end of 2022, nearly 750,000 individual Shareholders of the Group held 35% of the share capital: this proportion held by individual Shareholders is unique within the CAC 40 and significantly exceeds the proportion of other CAC 40 companies.\n\nThe website for recruiting new Shareholders, was relaunched with a series of updates. It presents the performance of Air Liquide's shares and explains the Group's strategy in a new way. To show the regularity and  level  of performance of the Air Liquide share, a simulator allows the visitor to position sliders to select the duration and the amount of the investment, then to compare this performance with that of the Livret A (France's most popular savings account). This simulator is now integrated into the site and aims to attract new individual shareholders. The recruitment site is the subject to a referencing campaign in order to increase the number of visits and improve its positioning in search engines. It is an important tool to encourage people who are not  Air  Liquide's  Shareholders  to invest in this security. https:// deveniractionnaire.airliquide.com, https:// www.airliquide.com/\n\n<!-- image -->",

As part of the Boursolive digital fair, the 1 st 'Let's Talk Equities' webinar was launched. The direct broadcast and its replay won over  the  audience  with  more  than 11,000 views. This type  of direct exchange  will continue to be developed and a 2 nd live  webinar was organized for which more than  400 questions from  Shareholders  were asked.  The  aim  of this new format is to inform individual Shareholders by answering their  questions, as well as  to make  shareholding accessible to beginners.\n\nA series  of  podcasts  was  broadcast  during  summer  2022.  With original topics such as cosmetics and food, they reached a new audience of younger people who are used to this type of format, with nearly 8,000 total listeners.\n\nFinally,  short videos called  'Speed  learning' were offered  in  the Shareholders section of the Group's website. They allow a very specific subject related to shareholding to be presented in a short format, such as the loyalty bonus offered by Air Liquide to registered Shareholders or the elements that contribute to the development of a share portfolio. This format will continue to be developed because it provides a quick and very clear way to address topics that are important to Shareholders.\n\n## MEETINGS WITH SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe General Meeting: following two General Meetings held behind closed doors, the return to meeting in-person brought together nearly 4,000 Shareholders at the General Meeting of May 4, 2022: around 2,500 were physically present at the Palais des Congr\u00e8s in Paris and nearly  1,500  watched  the  webcast  live. Almost  40  minutes  of  discussions  with  Shareholders  took  place during this  General  Meeting. The dates for the next Air Liquide Combined General Meeting are May 3, 2023, April 30, 2024 and May 6, 2025.\n\nThe 'Post-General Meeting' conference: each year, following the General Meeting, the Chairman visits a city in the regions to present the Group's results, strategy and outlook to Shareholders. Thus, on May 12, 2022, more than 500 Shareholders gathered in Lille to listen to the presentation by the Chairman, who was accompanied by \u00c9milie Mouren-Renouard and Matthieu Giard, members of the Executive Committee. The public  was able to talk to  the presenters and employees  in the Shareholder  Services Department who accompanied this trip.\n\nShareholder meetings: the Shareholder Services  Department regularly meets with Shareholders in the regions. Given the health context, only two meetings could be organized in 2022: Nantes on October 3 and Toulouse on December 6. These meetings, attended by several hundred Shareholders, provide an opportunity to talk to the public, answer their many questions and present the company and the main services offered by Air  Liquide.  In 2022, the  SSD also organized a roadshow  in  Switzerland  to  meet  foreign investors in three different cities: Zurich, Lugano and Geneva.\n\n' Investir Day ': Air Liquide took part in the 2022 edition, which consisted of a series of digital meetings spread over several weeks and a  day of events  on  Tuesday,  November 29,  2022  at  the Carrousel  du  Louvre.  Fran\u00e7ois Jackow, Chief Executive  Officer,  presented the strategies  and  outlook of  the Group  during  a digital presentation.  Three  members  of the  Executive Committee,  Diana  Schillag, \u00c9milie  Mouren-Renouard and Matthieu Giard had the pleasure of participating  in  round  tables  and  answering questions from a large audience of people wishing to learn more about Air Liquide, as well as people who were already Shareholders. This event is part of the strategy for recruiting new Shareholders and has a national scope.\n\n## 3.5.2.  Institutional investors\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer met with more than 400 investors in 2022, in Europe and the United States. Over the course of five roadshows, he held individual meetings with 25 major Shareholders, attended three meetings with a limited number of investors and four plenary sessions, notably during conferences.\n\nThe Chairman of  the Board of Directors met with three major Shareholders in 2022 to discuss governance issues.\n\nThe Investor Relations team met with more than 1,400 investors in 2022 during seven roadshows, 36 conferences and numerous individual meetings.  Members  of the  Executive Committee took part in a large number of these events.\n\nSome meetings were held by videoconference, a practice that has become normal since the health crisis.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Sustainable finance\n\n## 4.1. OVERVIEW\n\nSince  2012  and the issuance  by Air  Liquide of the  first Socially Responsible Investment-certified bond (500 million euros, refinancing the acquisitions of Gasmedi and LVL M\u00e9dical) in the Home Healthcare sector, the financial sector has made significant progress in terms of Sustainable Development.\n\nThe Paris Agreement signed in 2015, and more recently the European Taxonomy,  encourage investors and  lenders to direct their capital towards sustainable assets by placing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria at the heart of their investment decision strategy. Issuers are encouraged to use financing linked to CSR criteria.\n\nSustainable financial instruments now represent a significant share of all bond market issues, a share that is expected to increase in the coming years.\n\nThere are currently two main sustainable financing mechanisms:\n\n- \u25a0 credit lines, bonds and loans backed by extra-financial performance indicators ('KPIs'), for which the funds raised are not dedicated to specific investments or expenses but whose cost depends on the achievement of these KPIs;\n- \u25a0 'Green',  'Social'  and 'Sustainable'  bonds or  loans,  in which the funds raised are dedicated to specific projects.\n\nNon-governmental organizations such as the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) have also published guidelines to ensure the transparency and credibility  of the developing CSR financial market.\n\n## 4.2. INITIATIVES\n\nAs part of its growth strategy combining financial and extrafinancial performance, in March 2021, Air Liquide presented new objectives  for ACT  in  favor of a  sustainable  future. Air  Liquide's responsible and sustainable growth model also applies to its financial policy.\n\nThe Group is thus turning to the opportunities offered by the finance market by acquiring new responsible and sustainable financial instruments.\n\n## 4.2.1.  Alignment of the syndicated credit line with three CSR objectives (2019)\n\nIn December 2019, the Group introduced a mechanism in its 2.5 billion euro syndicated credit line aimed at correlating the costs  of  this  credit line  with three  of  its  CSR  (Corporate  Social Responsibility) objectives in the fields of carbon intensity, gender diversity,  and safety. This  indexation  mechanism consists of an increase or  decrease in the  cost  of  financing  and commissions paid according to the achievement of objectives set annually for each criterion.\n\nThe environmental and societal performance criteria are as follows:\n\n- \u25a0 the Group's carbon intensity;\n- \u25a0 the proportion of women among engineers and executives;\n- \u25a0 the frequency rate of accidents resulting in lost time.\n\nSince the implementation of this correlation mechanism, Air Liquide  benefited from  a  reduction in the  cost of  its  syndicated credit line in 2020 and 2021, thanks to the achievement of these three CSR objectives.\n\n## 4.2.2.  Implementation of a Sustainable Financing Framework and first green bond (2021)\n\nFollowing the announcement of its sustainability objectives in March 2021, Air Liquide also implemented a Sustainable Financing Framework in May 2021. This framework makes it possible to support  the financing  and  refinancing of assets and projects intended to have a clear benefit for the environment and society. It is aligned with the 'Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018', 'Green Bond Principles 2018', 'Social Bond Principles 2020', 'Social Loan Principles 2021' and the 'Green Loan Principles 2021' overseen by the ICMA (International Capital Market Association), and validated by the Sustainalytics agency.\n\nThis initiative reflects a threefold ambition for the Group:\n\n- \u25a0 align its financing strategy with its sustainability objectives;\n- \u25a0 contribute to the development of sustainable finance;\n- \u25a0 diversify its investor base.\n\nThis responsible and sustainable financing framework enables the Group to  raise  funds  through  bond  issues, loans and any other instrument dedicated to financing sustainable projects.\n\nMoreover, as part of this 'Sustainable Financing Framework', the Group completed its first green bond issue in May 2021, raising 500 million euros to finance and refinance several sustainable development projects, most notably in hydrogen, biogas and oxygen.\n\nAs part of the management of its cash surpluses, Air Liquide now favors sustainable investment vehicles, such as SRI-certified funds or funds likely to promote environmental and social characteristics.  While  this allocation  does  not  currently  apply  to the majority of its investments, the Group intends to support market dynamics by  relying  on a  growing range of investment vehicles eligible under Articles 8 and 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainable development disclosures in the financial services sector (known as the 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ALIAD AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nSince 2020, ALIAD, the Air Liquide Group's venture capital fund, has strengthened its position in impact start-ups. With more than 25 million euros invested, including 15 million euros in the field of energy transition, ALIAD is thus contributing to the  Air Liquide Group's strategic ADVANCE program, which combines growth and a sustainable future.\n\nFor example, in 2022, ALIAD invested in Botalys, a Belgian startup that develops rare and medicinal plants by recreating  ideal growing conditions through indoor vertical farming.\n\nIn 2022, ALIAD has also reinforced its investment in Flying Whales. This start-up is developing the 'LCA60T' (Large Capacity Airship 60 tonnes) aeronautical program, an aircraft that can load and unload up to 60 tonnes of cargo while hovering. In addition to the ability to reach remote delivery points, this solution minimizes the footprint and emissions associated with transportation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To strengthen this priority, the Group Customer Department is supervised by a member of the Executive Committee.\n\nAs part of its Healthcare business, Air Liquide strives to offer solutions that aim to  improve the  quality  of life  of patients and enable caregivers to focus on their medical duties. This approach is an essential lever for improving the health outcomes expected by patients and is an integral part of our 'Value-Based Healthcare' strategy.\n\n## 5.1.

Home healthcare\n\nAs a leader in home healthcare in Europe (in number of patients supported), Air Liquide provides care in the home for people with chronic  diseases.  The  Group  provides  respiratory  and perfusion assistance solutions (e.g. for diabetes or Parkinson's). Thanks to its expert multidisciplined teams, Air Liquide aims to increase patients' autonomy and quality of life, improve their treatment compliance and lower their risk of relapse or rehospitalization.\n\nThe  Home Healthcare  business is one of the  responses to the shift to outpatient care and sits at the heart of the healthcare system between the patient, hospital or other healthcare facilities, doctors, nurses, health insurance organizations, pharmacists and others. It supplies the services, products and/or medical equipment necessary to start treatment at the patient's home, following  the medical  prescription,  and  coachs  the patients and their  families  in  the  proper  use  of  devices. Air  Liquide  has  three key leverages; its close human proximity to patients at home for over 30 years, its technical knowledge of medical devices (whether connected or not), and its innovative strength, particularly in digital solutions. The Group therefore makes a major  contribution  to  the  continuum of care  by  ensuring  regular support for patients with chronic conditions. This activity requires focusing  on what  really matters to  the patient  to improve  their quality of life. To this end, Air Liquide offers personalized support plans, providing the support each patient needs when he or she needs it.\n\n## 5.2.2.  Hospital businesses\n\nAir Liquide is one of the world leaders in medical gas production and distribution for hospitals and related services.\n\nThe teams work  alongside healthcare professionals to  develop solutions that allow them to focus on their medical duties at times that are often critical for patients. Whether in emergency rooms, operating rooms, or intensive care units,  Air Liquide's medical gases and associated services make it possible to provide care, alleviate pain, administer anesthetics and improve respiratory functions.\n\nAir Liquide offers services such as 'Total Gas Management' (TGM), which remains permanently at the hospital in order to optimize the supply of medical gases and monitor the different supply parameters so that the hospital can function efficiently. Air Liquide supports the transformation of hospital care and the development of outpatient care with a significant presence in the urban medical sector and other care centers that serve as an alternative to hospitals.\n\n## 5.2.3.  Diversification of care settings\n\nAir Liquide is interested in new alternative care locations between the home and the hospital, because it makes it possible to offer a continuity of care to patients, especially severe ones. The Group is already operating in this field through its local entities in Germany, for example, with the therapy apartments model, in Italy with nursing care for patients with chronic conditions, and in Poland, with a facility specializing in the care of ventilated patients.\n\nAir Liquide's solutions are also dispensed by certain specialists in doctors' practices, in new care settings other than hospitals, and in retirement homes. Healthcare professionals such as ambulance attendants, general practitioners, dermatologists and dentists are local practitioners who play an essential role in caring for patients at various stages in their continuum of care.\n\nIn response to changing care settings and healthcare coordination issues, Air  Liquide provides an  offering tailored to  their specific needs, particularly in terms of mobility, ease of use of their medical devices, and autonomy in monitoring their treatment.\n\n## 5.2.4.  Societal initiatives in healthcare\n\nOn March 23, 2021, as  part  of  its  new  sustainability  objectives, the Group  reaffirmed  its commitment to  supporting  patients, as defined in the 'Care for patients' pillar of its 'ACT for a sustainable future' objectives. In the process, the Group demonstrates how it  is  shaping  the  transformation of  healthcare worldwide, through its businesses' contribution and collaboration with the healthcare ecosystem.\n\nWorking alongside patients, healthcare professionals and hospitals, Air Liquide's healthcare teams strive to improve support for  patients and make the healthcare  system more efficient  and beneficial for everyone. As a key player in the healthcare sector, Air Liquide offers solutions in a wide range of care settings, from hospitals and at-home  care  to community  healthcare  practices, long-term care facilities, and emergency services. At the height of the global covid-19 pandemic in particular, the Group's Healthcare business line worked hard to positively impact society.\n\nAs an expert in the supply of medical gases and related services, as well as in home healthcare services, Air Liquide has set itself two main goals:\n\n- a) improving the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases in mature economies;\n- b) improving access to medical oxygen in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n## a) Improving the quality of life of patients living at home with chronic diseases in mature economies\n\nThe contribution of Air Liquide's home healthcare activities to the Group's ESG strategy will be based on its strong expertise in the care and monitoring of patients living at home with chronic diseases. Air Liquide is committed to improving patients' quality of life by raising awareness of the disease, supporting and empowering patients, helping them identify the most important outcomes to them,  and  tailoring  our  healthcare  services  to their personal situation and lifestyle.\n\nThe Group is pursuing two sets of concrete measures to improve the care and benefits that matter most to patients:\n\n- \u25a0 develop initiatives in partnership with patient associations, healthcare professionals, and institutions;\n- \u25a0 establish personalized support plans.\n\nTo take  these  measures  further, the  Group has set up  a solid global organizational structure in 19 countries (mainly in Europe but also in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions). It consists of a multidisciplinary task force mandated with building a strategic vision, supporting the roll-out and monitoring of action taken using appropriate monitoring indicators, and coordinating an international champions network in the countries who are responsible for rolling out the measures locally and reporting on them.",

        "page_content": "## EXTRA-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DECLARATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## Developing initiatives in partnership with patient associations, healthcare professionals and institutions\n\nAir Liquide's healthcare teams work with patient communities on a daily  basis to increase awareness of illnesses and treatments, share knowledge with patients and caregivers, promote self-care, and ultimately improve patients' autonomy and quality of life.\n\nThese patient-centric  initiatives  focus  on a variety  of conditions such as diabetes, sleep  apnea, Parkinson's disease,  and other respiratory diseases  treated  with  oxygen  and/or ventilation, and are being developed in partnership with organizations such as patient associations, healthcare institutions (hospitals and others), healthcare professionals, scientific bodies and universities.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide's Home Healthcare entities developed 90 patient-centric initiatives in conjunction with 222 partners. Geographically, most initiatives in 2022 were rolled out in Europe.\n\n- \u25a0 In Spain, VitalAire developed the Inspira 360 program in partnership with a patient association EPOC Espana and the scientific company Separ with the aim of improving treatment compliance and the quality of life of people with sleep apnea or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This program provides engaging and educational video content for patients and their caregivers using a dedicated application or the VitalAire website. All caregivers promote this content at home and within the 'Punto Inspira' centers during each discussion with patients.\n- \u25a0 In Portugal, the collaboration with two scientific companies APS (Portuguese Sleep  Association) and SPP (Portuguese Pneumology Society), made it possible to design the VitalCare model, an omnichannel personalized support service for people with sleep apnea. Initiated in November 2021, a clinical study  conducted  with five hospitals aims to  demonstrate the benefits of this model on treatment compliance, quality of life, and experience with therapy, compared to standard support.\n- \u25a0 In Germany,  VitalAire,  has  developed  a  clinical  study of the closed-loop system (combining an insulin pump and a continuous glucose monitoring device) for type 1 diabetes patients in partnership with the Center of Excellence 'Auf der Bult',  a  specialized  diabetes  center  for  children  in  Hannover. The main goal of this initiative is to evaluate the improvement of quality of life of children with type 1 diabetes. The combination of technology and service could help to keep blood sugar levels at an acceptable level while reducing hypoglycemia  and hyperglycemia events  and  also improving the quality of life of children with diabetes.\n- \u25a0 In Brazil, Air Liquide Healthcare is working on an initiative aimed at increasing awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)  and  its  treatments and  improving the  quality  of life  of ALS patients through greater patient knowledge and caregiver training. The initiative is being conducted in collaboration with the  Paulo  Gontijo Institute and the  Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Pr\u00f3-Cura da ELA. Digital tools such as videos, articles and webinars have been made available to patients and caregivers. This educational material aims at giving patients and caregivers a better understanding of the condition and its treatment, especially the therapeutic use of mechanical ventilation. Ultimately patients could be more autonomous in managing their treatment.\n\n## Establishing personalized support plans\n\nPersonalized support plans mean that healthcare services are defined based on  'what  really matters' to  patients, their health and their lifestyle, and on expected clinical and quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nTheses personalized support plans are the foundation of a 'Valuebased Healthcare' approach, to adapt the service to the needs of the patient and improve the benefits for patients at the best cost for all.\n\n| Key indicator                                                                                     | As of December 31, 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Percentage of patients with personalized support plans (treatment adherence & outcome-based care) | 49%                       |\n| Number of patients with personalized support plans (treatment adherence & outcome-based care)     | 910,000                   |\n\nAir Liquide has developed two different levels of personalization:\n\n- \u25a0 treatment adherence: the first level of personalization involves measuring the patient's treatment  adherence,  collecting and analyzing patient data through the connected medical devices used by the patient, and then tailoring the services to the patient's  needs.  This  level of personalized  health  services  is well developed in countries such as France and Spain for sleep apnea. The goal is to extend this level of personalization to various  target countries  and  to the  different  diseases and therapies covered by the Healthcare businesses.\n\n- \u25a0 patient benefit-oriented care. This corresponds to the second level of personalization and is designed to improve the patient's clinical and quality-of-life outcomes. Understanding each patient individual characteristics (behavior and lifestyles, social  environment) allows one to tailor healthcare service to their profile and define it based on expected clinical and quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nAir Liquide has started implementing this value-based healthcare model in countries such as Spain and France, focusing on patients  with  sleep  apnea  and/or  receiving  ventilation  treatment. The goal is to develop this level of personalization in other countries and for other therapies steadily.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Based on the principles of 'value in healthcare', this program was awarded the 'Value-Based Healthcare' Center Europe in 2020. Thanks to the introduction of a support plan tailored  to  each patient's  profile, appropriate  support  at different stages of the patient's journey, and ongoing outcome measurement, patients  have more autonomy in  managing their treatment, greater adherence to their therapy, and quality of life.The next step  in the  PIMA program is to demonstrate that these clinical benefits have an impact on healthcare expenditures by reducing the costs associated with sleep apnea complications over a year.\n\n## b) Improving access to medical oxygen in low- and middle-income countries\n\nAir Liquide intends to rely on its expertise in the supply of medical oxygen to increase access to oxygen for populations in low- and middle-income countries.  The Group  favours initiatives that  are sustainable in the long term and respect strict ethical guidelines.\n\nRespiratory infections, and pneumonia in particular, are the leading cause of death in children under five in developing economies. Acute phases can be treated with antibiotics and oxygen therapy.\n\nMore generally, improving access to medical oxygen in these countries is a priority. This need was acutely felt during the covid-19 crisis.\n\nThe Group has implemented an 'Access Oxygen' program since 2017, to ensure that rural and suburban populations in low- and middle-income countries have safe, reliable and affordable access to oxygen over the long term.\n\nTo set up a medical oxygen supply infrastructure, Air Liquide relies on:\n\n- \u25a0 Air Liquide teams, which support the deployment of the Access Oxygen solution;\n- \u25a0 international donors or Group subsidiaries that finance the necessary equipment;\n- \u25a0 local entrepreneurs who implement Access Oxygen in the beneficiary healthcare structures.\n\nAccess Oxygen offers an oxygen therapy kit, a training program for healthcare personnel with the provision of digital tools (Access Oxygen application -Oxygen Academy platform) and an equipment maintenance service.\n\nAt  the end  of  2022,  to  better  structure  its  action and  effectively support its partners, social entrepreneurs or international organizations, the  Group  set  up  a  dedicated subsidiary, Access Oxygen SAS, a simplified joint stock company (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Simplifi\u00e9e) under French law. It will contribute its know-how in the design  and  operation of  adapted, safe, robust  and  sustainable oxygen solutions.\n\nIn 2022, the Group's teams continued to facilitate access to oxygen:\n\n| Key indicator of oxygen access                                     | As of December 31, 2021   | As of December 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Estimate of the population benefiting from easier access to oxygen |                           |                           |\n| through Air Liquide's 'Access Oxygen' action                       | 1,032,000                 | 1,778,000                 |\n\nTo this end, they have carried out or developed projects in Senegal, South Africa and Kenya:\n\n## ACCESS OXYGEN IN SENEGAL\n\nAir Liquide launched the 'Access Oxygen' initiative in Senegal in 2017, to contribute in particular to reducing infant mortality related to  pneumonia. In 2020, an international organization for children asked Air Liquide to equip 87 rural health structures in three districts of Casamance and the center of the country and to train their workers. The contract was successfully concluded in August 2022, benefiting a population of more than 700,000 people.  In addition, the  health centers  in Senegal  benefiting from 'Access Oxygen' have contributed to the country's response to the covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## PARTNERSHIP WITH UNJANI CLINICS IN SOUTH AFRICA\n\nUnjani Clinics is a network of primary care clinics aimed at improving access to healthcare for middle-class South Africans in rural and suburban areas.  This network also contributes to the national program for the emancipation of young black  women. Unjani Clinics is collaborating with VitalAire South Africa, the Group's Health subsidiary, to extend the  availability  of medical oxygen to all clinics in the network, thanks to the 'Access Oxygen' offer.  VitalAire provides training and  helps  increase  the skills  of medical personnel working with oxygen therapy and related equipment. Air Liquide also provides part of the equipment financing through its subsidiary in South Africa. The 132 clinics of the Unjani network are now equipped with the Access Oxygen kit, which provides close access to oxygen to more than  700,000 people in the country.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\n## FIRST PILOT PROJECT DEPLOYED IN KENYA\n\nIn July 2022, the NGO Center for Public Health and Development, a partner of Access Oxygen in Kenya, received 20,000 US dollars from an  international foundation to launch an  initial pilot in the country with five healthcare facilities. The financing covers equipment  and  service  costs  for a  period of six months.  These five structures were deployed in September 2022 in the Bungoma region.\n\nThanks to the roll-out of this initial pilot, it is estimated that around 50,000 people in the region benefit from access to medical oxygen.\n\n## COLLECTIVE ACTION WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY\n\nAir Liquide works with other players in the international community to support access to oxygen in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, Air  Liquide is part of  the 'Every Breath  Counts'  coalition, which regularly brings together those involved in oxygen access (NGOs, lenders, manufacturers, service providers, etc.) and contributes to its work. Air Liquide also collaborates with the 'Access to Medicine Foundation', which has experience in strategies for access to healthcare products in the poorest countries.\n\n## 5.3. FROM LISTENING TO ACTION\n\nSince 2017, the  Group has been directed toward a customercentric transformation, boosted by a customer experience management tool called 'Voice of Customer' (VoC). This solution allows all  entities to regularly poll (through  digital channels) an unlimited  number  of  customers,  analyze their  comments  in real time, identify dissatisfied customers, contact them again and take the necessary steps to address the reasons for their dissatisfaction. Thanks to the broad sharing of customer comments at every  level of the  Group,  appropriate  action  plans have been identified and implemented to improve their experience. To date, VoC has already been rolled out in 60 Group subsidiaries worldwide.\n\nThe VoC survey is now available in two formats: an annual survey that  covers all stages of the customer experience and a more frequent transactional survey that measures satisfaction at a particular stage: offer, order, delivery, invoicing, technical service, etc. Their feedback tells us that our customers particularly appreciate the  quality  and safety  of our products  and services, and  the professionalism and efficiency  of the  teams in  contact with them.\n\nThe annual survey also allows us to monitor two common KPIs at Group level, the NPS (Net Promoter Score\u00ae) and the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) score. The NPS measures customers 'intention to recommend using a simple question: 'On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend Air Liquide as a supplier?' Since the launch of the VoC surveys, we have seen a steady improvement in this score across all business lines.\n\nThe ESG score is part of the Group's commitment to a sustainable future:  supporting  our  customers  and  patients,  while taking into  account  the urgency of  climate  change and  societal developments. With 50,000 responses collected,  the  ESG score reaches 8.65 points out of 10 in 2022, an improvement over the 2021 results (8.43 points). For industrial customers, this translates into the most ambitious targets in our sector to reduce the carbon intensity of our activities. In the health sector, the Group aims to improve the quality of life of patients while helping to make healthcare  systems  more efficient.  The ESG score  allows  us  to monitor  the  satisfaction  of  our  customers  and  patients on these\n\naspects. For example, Industrial Merchant customers were asked about their satisfaction with Air Liquide's contribution to their environmental objectives (reduction of the environmental footprint, CO2 emissions, energy efficiency). Patients and healthcare professionals evaluated Air Liquide's ethical, responsible and safety-conscious behavior.\n\nIn addition to the indicators described above related to the Voice of Customer, other indicators are used to improve the experience provided to our customers, in particular to smooth their pathway and reduce to zero all possible points of friction. It is recognized that the more fluid the experience, the lower the risk of the customer changing suppliers.\n\nAn excellent example is the 'Customer Effort Score' used in our US operations, which consists of several indicators (up to 10 individual operational indicators) such as open orders, blocked invoices,  late deliveries,  litigation rate, etc.  This  indicator is not linked  to a particular  customer but  relates  to  a  geography or  a business and is used to assess the quality of Air Liquide's activities.\n\nManagers use the indicator to easily identify the areas that create the most  friction and  the opportunities for  improvement,  so that they may act accordingly.\n\nSUCCESSFUL CUSTOMER COMMITMENT\n\n(a) Based on customer satisfaction survey feedback (92% in 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThanks to the feedback from our customers and patients collected via  VoC,  several  actions  have  been  implemented at both Group level and locally in the entities to improve their experience.\n\nThus,  when Air  Liquide France  was  notified  by its  customers  of the difficulty in finding the right contact person, the 'Single Number' project was launched: from more than 25 telephone numbers  available to customers,  the entity switched to a  single number. The people in charge of customer calls respond directly to approximately 70% of their requests and forward the remaining, more complex  requests to specialists  for  immediate  processing. Another example of a project guided by customers' voices is improving the invoicing process. Invoices have been digitized and simplified, dividing the number of possible rental ranges by four, facilitating administrative processing and payment. Customer service is one of the essential pillars of the customer experience. Air Liquide has decided to redeploy a training course that aims to solidify the fundamentals in all geographies, specifically targeting the Industrial Merchant teams. The 3C training makes it possible to frame in three actions - 'Connect - Counsel - Conclude' - the 20 best  behaviors  to  maintain  when interacting  with customers. This is an interactive training focused on concrete examples with many scenarios. It is provided internally by local 'champions'. This approach not only allows us  to promote the skills of our employees but also to ensure continuous and sustainable monitoring. The 3C training aims to improve the experience of our customers, but also of our employees by supporting them in working in a cooperative environment.\n\nAll these changes were implemented thanks to the commitment of our employees. To recognize employees who deliver exceptional customer  experiences and the  efforts  made by both  individuals and teams to serve and satisfy our customers and patients, specific awards, known as 'Customer Mindset Awards', have been created in several of our entities. These events demonstrate how much the customer experience is a vital element at Air Liquide  and highlight  behaviors that  create  added value for  our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Sustainable procurement and suppliers\n\nAir Liquide strives to build long-lasting and balanced relationships with its  suppliers  in an environment  of  mutual  trust.  The  Group attaches great importance to its suppliers' ability to offer long-term partnerships and ensure a high level of safety, reliability, competitiveness,  and innovation, while  guaranteeing that  ethics and sustainable development are also taken into account. These principles are set out in the following documents:\n\n- \u25a0 the Sustainable Procurement procedure ,  updated in  2019, which lays out the guidelines to be applied by the procurement departments to integrate ethical, social and environmental aspects into their procurement processes, and defines the prevention approach for related supplier risks;\n- \u25a0 the Procurement Code of Conduct , available in 11 languages, is mandatory for all Group employees engaged in Procurement activities;\n- \u25a0 the Supplier Code of Conduct available in 14 languages aims in particular to promote practices relating to human rights, the protection of the environment and safety and ensure compliance by all suppliers. This code is publicly available on the Air Liquide website ( It is based on the Group's Code of Conduct and all suppliers have to adhere to it / sign it; https://www.airliquide.com/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-procurement).\n- \u25a0 a CSR commitment clause (covering compliance with the Supplier's Code  of  Conduct, safety, and the  environment)  is included in the contract templates with suppliers, including those for framework agreements.\n\n## 6.1. SUPPLIER MAPPING\n\nAs part of its monitoring process, the Group maps its Sustainability-Critical Suppliers, according to four main criteria:\n\n- 1\u00b0 annual spend;\n- 2\u00b0 the risk relating to the nature of the supplier's activity;\n- 3\u00b0 the risk relating to the supplier's country of operations; and\n- 4\u00b0 the supplier's dependency on Air Liquide.\n\nIn 2022, an evaluation and action plan campaign targeted 48% of the 1,177 suppliers identified as Sustainability-Critical Suppliers.\n\n341 suppliers  were assessed,  an  increase  of  37%  compared  to 2021. 75 suppliers needing improvement or non-compliant have also prepared corrective action plans.\n\nThe actions carried out as part of this assessment campaign ensure that sustainability-critical suppliers have systems in place to avoid environmental, human rights, and labor risks from occurring  in their supply chain.  It  also  helps  guide  and support suppliers in their continuous improvement on these issues.\n\n## 6.2. \"PROCURE TO NEUTRALITY\", THE CLIMATE ROADMAP FOR PROCUREMENT\n\nIn its new strategic plan ADVANCE for the 2022-2025 period, announced in March 2022, Air Liquide reaffirmed its ambition to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Procurement has a key role to play in supporting this objective throughout the supply chain of the Group's businesses, in particular:\n\n- \u25a0 by supporting its suppliers in the decarbonization of the goods and services that the Group purchases;\n- \u25a0 by helping to reduce the Group's emissions; and\n- \u25a0 by contributing to the development of low-carbon solutions offered to its customers.\n\nIn 2021, the  Group  Procurement  Department initiated  a  climate roadmap, 'Procure to Neutrality' based on four pillars:\n\n- \u25a0 Measure: improve the  greenhouse gas ,emission  calculation methodology (Scope 3), where relevant and feasible;\n- \u25a0 Engage buyers, with the training of the procurement community; engage our suppliers identified based on the basis of a mapping as the most significant in terms of emissions;\n- \u25a0 Leverage to value contributions  of  Procurement  to  reducing Air Liquide's Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions;\n- \u25a0 Reduce: define  an objective, with  the aim to align with the Group's carbon neutrality ambitions.\n\nIn 2022, around 30% of the procurement community took part in training sessions on key concepts for understanding climate issues, carbon accounting methodologies and greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives. In addition,  75 suppliers, among those most exposed to risks related to greenhouse gas emissions, were asked to answer a dedicated questionnaire to evaluate their level of maturity in this area.\n\nIn June 2022, Air Liquide was awarded one of the two Gold Medals in the 'Purchasing Team Challenge of the Year' category at the Troph\u00e9es des Achats en France ( for the creation of a module integrating the assessment of suppliers' climate maturity and CO2 emissions linked to manufacturing, transport and equipment use. This module is integrated into the selection criteria for suppliers of strategic equipment. https://www.republikgroupachats.fr/trophees-des-achats)\n\n## 6.3. REDUCING OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS\n\nThe Group's Procurement organizations strive to support and develop actions to reduce the environmental impact of its activities. Numerous initiatives are led by the subsidiaries, such as waste reduction or the development of the circular economy. These initiatives  are  shared throughout the Group to encourage replication. A few examples:\n\n## Reverse Logistic project\n\nReverse logistics is a set of procedures and means for collecting and transporting post-consumer products to the industrial sector, such  as  the  automotive,  aeronautics,  electronics  or  construction sectors  for  reuse  by  the  suppliers  themselves  and/or in  the  raw materials chain.",

        "page_content": "## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nLarge amounts of energy are consumed when a new product is made from a raw material or through reverse logistics. Recycling products reduces the amount of energy required to produce these items.\n\nOne objective is to  reduce the  environmental  impact by  reusing raw materials in the  manufacturing  process  of the  products we purchase.\n\nBrazil has developed and implemented this solution. The benefits were as follows: environmental (waste reduction, circular economy), financial (cost reduction and maximization of gains through negotiation with suppliers), and management (process centralization with better control and traceability).\n\n## Project Second Life\n\nIn  Canada, a program has been developed and implemented to refurbish  truck chassis used  for  logistics and  the distribution  of gas cylinders to  customers. It allows the  use  of  old  chassis on new trucks, thus extending their total lifespan from 7 to 14 years. This  results  in  not  only  cost  savings,  but also  a  reduction  in Air Liquide's carbon footprint.\n\nOne of the objectives is to reduce the carbon footprint per truck by avoiding  the  waste  of  materials through renovating and  reusing the chassis, rather than constructing new equipment.\n\n## An innovative project to recycle ALTOP cylinder protection plastics\n\nAir Liquide launched its line of gas cylinder heads, known as 'TOP,' in the 1990s. These cylinder heads are called ALTOP, MINITOP, and SMARTOP. Most of these solutions include specific protective valve covers that have been manufactured in plastic for reasons related  to  the  housing  of  the  integrated  valves,  weight, cost and design. All of them are produced from the same material. Until now, the end-of-life of these objects did not meet Air Liquide's objectives in terms of consistency and sustainability.\n\nIn  addition  to the  decision made to choose materials  other  than plastic for such applications (aluminum, steel), a unique recycling method has been devised by Air Liquide and developed with the partners concerned. This led to the validation of a virtuous process, allowing new MINITOP (latest plastic model) protective covers to be produced using plastic waste from ALTOP or MINITOP covers. In addition to the clear benefits of decarbonization, this process is economically viable.\n\n## 6.4. PROCUREMENT RESILIENCE\n\nThe industrial world is simultaneously confronted with new, increasingly  unpredictable and  atypical  crises of unprecedented magnitude (covid-19, political instabilities, wars, inflation, computer attacks, etc.). In this context, it is essential to strengthening the resilience of Air Liquide's  supply chain. This resilience -an organization's ability to recover quickly from difficulties  is  essential to ensure the continuity of operations and deliveries to patients and customers.\n\nWith this in mind, Air Liquide Procurement has developed a streamlined and agile approach based on four essential capabilities to identify our vulnerabilities:\n\n- \u25a0 Visibility (e.g. demand forecast);\n- \u25a0 Agility (e.g.new suppliers qualification);\n\n- \u25a0 Collaboration (e.g.work closely with Operations); and\n- \u25a0 Control (e.g.supplier performance monitoring).\n\nIt is supported by a clear governance structure and data analysis tools.\n\nUsing this model and the associated tools, Air Liquide's Procurement organization can implement an action plan for each assessed risk. For example, to limit inflation risks, the Group uses contract cost structures, or to avoid equipment shortages, it develops a tool for forecasting demand and faced with geopolitical risks, it diversifies supply sources.\n\n## 6.5. SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT TRAINING AND AWARENESS\n\nSeveral measures have been implemented to raise awareness and train buyers in the Group's Sustainable Procurement process, thus strengthening its roll out within the organization. Sustainable Procurement training modules have been developed.  They are aimed at Group's entire Purchasing population and for critical suppliers, and serve to:\n\n- \u25a0 show the  consistency  between  the Sustainable  Procurement approach and the Group's strategy;\n- \u25a0 explain the challenges of the Sustainable Procurement approach and position it as a source of value creation;\n- \u25a0 present various tools to facilitate the roll-out of this approach.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide organized training sessions in French, English and Chinese to raise awareness among buyers and suppliers of the Group's Sustainable Procurement. Training courses are organized by subject and by geography.\n\nA total of 279 buyers and 82 suppliers were trained  in  2022  on topics related to sustainability and the duty of vigilance.\n\n## 6.6. SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT FOR ALL\n\nSince 2018, in France,  Air Liquide has organized five annual editions of the 'Inclusive Procurement Business Meeting' bringing together Air  Liquide key  players and companies in the  disability sector (EA, ESAT, TIH) to promote socially inclusive procurement. In 2022, the 'Inclusive Procurement Business Meeting', co-hosted with the Handeco association, was conducted in a digital and face-to-face format through presentations and speed meetings.\n\nOne particular angle was addressed during a round table on the subject of 'Inclusive procurement, a gateway to employment'. Through procurement, people working in organizations for the social and professional integration of disabled persons or adapted enterprises can be supported in the traditional business world, with adapted duties and workstations.\n\nNearly 100 people  from Air Liquide  and  10 suppliers from the disability sector took part in this event.\n\nIn addition, the European Inclusive Procurement Forum was organized for the second year in a row in 2022. During this forum, bringing together nearly 200 participants from operations, procurement and suppliers, experiences from France, Spain and the United Kingdom were shared to increase awareness and foster relationships with disability-inclusive companies.\n\n<!-- image -->",

THE WILL TO ACT FOR ALL\n\nThe Group is present in 73 countries (1) ,  because  its  production and distribution activities are local. Many years ago, long before defining its sustainable development strategy, the Group decided to act in the regions because it believes that it should participate in  the economies  of  the countries  in which it  operates,  and go further than the conduct of its activities. The Group,  therefore, carries out various acts to support local populations. To do this, it has several means of action: its corporate Foundation, which spearheads its charitable actions, and its local subsidiaries or specific projects, such as Access Oxygen.\n\nThe common denominator of these actions in the regions is the Group's strong desire to involve its employees in projects permanently and to act in line with its culture. This culture combines a scientific spirit and innovation, a long-term vision, concern for performance and compassion. The Group focuses on the areas where it can provide real value, by leveraging its technical and scientific expertise, and which it considers appropriate. Most of the supported projects are thus linked either to science and industry or health.\n\nIn 2022, the Group, its employees and its Shareholders met these challenges, as you can discover in this section.\n\n## CITIZEN AT WORK PROGRAM\n\nFor many years and throughout the world, Air Liquide's employees have been involved in helping local communities, either  during  or  outside  their  working  hours,  with the  support  of subsidiaries'  management  or  the  Foundation. To  encourage this even further among its 67,100 employees, the Group has created the Citizen at Work program to give employees the means to act and  increase  its  collective impact.  This initiative,  launched as  a pilot  scheme in  2022,  provides  subsidiaries  with  a framework to enable employees to volunteer in their local community. Depending on the country, a platform is made available to them to identify the projects in which to participate.\n\nThe program will be gradually rolled out across the entire Group to  reach  100% of entities by  2025. At the  end  of  2022,  43%  of Group employees already had access to this program. Each project  identified  as  part  of this  new  initiative  is  in  line with  Air Liquide's  sustainability  objectives  and enables employees to get involved in areas such as professional integration, children's learning, environmental protection, health and social inclusion.\n\nThe Citizen at Work program is particularly effective when combined with  the  Foundation's  financial  support  and  modes  of action. The Group was thus able to act quickly during the Ukraine crisis. The Citizen  at  Work program  made it  possible  to  devote time, to supervise and  support employees wishing  to help the refugees.\n\n(1)\n\n## 7.2. THE AIR LIQUIDE FOUNDATION\n\nCreated in 2008, the Air Liquide Corporate Foundation works with the Group to carry out missions of general interest. It relies on the Group's teams and skills to support projects of public interest, access to employment, scientific research, local solidarity or exceptional initiatives. The Foundation is subject to French law on foundations.\n\nProjects are mainly in Europe; they may, however, be located outside Europe if it is to support populations in distress. The Foundation has also used its resources during social crises, such as covid-19 or the massive arrivals of refugees (from Ukraine this year).\n\nThe Foundation works in the general interest, within the framework defined by the  law  and  its  articles of association, in accordance with its purpose. It shall not serve the Group's commercial  interests. Each project is clearly identified and the Foundation ensures that the allocated funds are properly used. It is governed by an published on its website. https://www.fondationairliquide.com/who-weare/governance/ethical-charter,\n\nThe Foundation is financed by ALSA and ALSI (Air Liquide Sant\u00e9 International), and since 2022, it has also received donations from Air  Liquide Shareholders and employees. More than 90% of the Foundation's budget is committed to projects, the balance going to operating expenses - in 2021 and 2022, this rate was 95%.\n\nThe Foundation  has  its  own  governance,  under the  aegis  of  its Board of Directors, on which representatives of Air Liquide, employees and 'qualified persons' sit. It relies on two project selection and  monitoring  committees, the  'Scientific Committee' and the 'Regional Committee'. One shareholder belonging to the Shareholders' Communication  Committee (SCC) is a  'Regional Committee' member.\n\nIn 2022, the Foundation supported 69 new non-profit or research projects, benefiting tens of thousands of people. These include:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nnew research projects, bringing the total number of research projects followed to 29\n\n16\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nnew employment access projects, including two multiyear partnerships\n\n49\n\nnew solidarity projects, including 41 as part of the exceptional aid program for refugees from Ukraine\n\nThe 69 new projects signed in 2022, located in 10 countries, break down as follows: 30 in France; 16 in Poland; 2 in Romania; 8 in Ukraine; 7 in Germany; 2 in Austria; 1 Vietnam; 1 en Switzerland; 1 in Morocco.\n\nSince its creation in 2008, the Fondation Air Liquide has supported nearly 550 projects with the Group in 52 countries.

In March, Air Liquide launched an exceptional program with the support of its Foundation. The Group's European teams have identified dozens of projects, many of which have been selected and supported. The Group endowed the Foundation with a special budget of more than \u20ac1 million over two years. Air Liquide employees and shareholders also generously contributed more than \u20ac200,000 in donations to the Foundation.\n\nIt is estimated that more than 60,000 refugees in seven European countries have benefited from this action.\n\n| Purpose              | To support NGO projects in the European Union, as close as possible to the needs of refugees.                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Projects supported   | \u25a0 medical and psychological assistance; \u25a0 emergency aid; \u25a0 reception centers; \u25a0 help with schooling and job search.                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Examples of projects |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                      | In 2022, the following were supported:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                      | \u25a0 13 medical and psychological assistance projects (France, Poland, Switzerland, Germany, Ukraine);                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                      | \u25a0 11 emergency aid projects (France, Poland, Germany, Ukraine);                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                      | \u25a0 10 reception center projects (Poland, Austria, Germany, Romania, Ukraine);                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                      | \u25a0 7 education and access to employment projects (Romania, France, Poland, Austria, Ukraine).                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Mode of action       | Similar to that described in the 'Promoting access to employment' table above.                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                      | The Group  acts on the ground, as closely as possible to the beneficiaries, thanks to its local teams who  support the associations in their projects and get involved to help beneficiaries, for example, by volunteering  (tutoring, CV writing, language lessons, etc.). |\n|                      | Volunteering missions were carried out on several projects as part of the 'Citizen at Work' project.                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nLastly,  several Group subsidiaries in  Europe  and  North America also made  donations in favor of  Ukrainian refugees,  with a  value equivalent to 227,000 euros.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The very origin of the Fondation Air Liquide is based on the direct involvement of employees. This is still one of its distinctive characteristics today. First of all, Group employees participate in the  governance of the Foundation (Board of Directors, Scientific Committee, Regional Committee). However, their involvement goes well beyond governance missions.\n\nEmployees can all  propose projects to support. Each  project  is studied  by a Manager  who  will  then  ensure  the monitoring and final assessment.\n\nIn the specific case of scientific projects, the Group's medical experts, researchers at the Group's Research Center or the Group's doctors are involved. They assess and monitor scientific projects. For projects in the regions, support is provided by employees who work close to these projects.\n\nOverall, organizations supported by the Foundation will be able to benefit from employees' professional skills. Regarding professional  integration, the Foundation's partnership with local Air Liquide teams also means that young people without a network of contacts can visit sites, learn more  about technical professions, take up internship offers or talk to sector professionals.\n\nTo date, hundreds of employees have been involved in these actions. Finally, many European employees are involved in projects to support Ukrainian refugees, notably through the 'Citizen at Work' program.\n\n## 'SHAREHOLDER' AND 'EMPLOYEE' DONORS\n\nMany Air Liquide shareholders and employees also provide financial support to the Group's societal action, through donations to the Fondation Air Liquide.\n\nFollowing a first fundraising campaign in 2021, in March 2022, the Foundation invited them to join the Group's action for the benefit of Ukrainian refugees in Europe through a donation platform.\n\nShareholders and employees generously responded to this appeal, contributing more than 200,000 euros, which was used for the first projects in spring 2022.\n\nThe possibility for shareholders and employees of a company to financially support the social action of their company, through donations to their company's Foundation, is set out in and governed by French law. Donations  give rise  to a tax receipt, under the conditions provided for by law.\n\nDonors are regularly informed of the use of their donations and the progress of the projects supported.\n\n## 7.3. OTHER PROGRAMS CARRIED OUT BY SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe Group's various subsidiaries also work directly and independently with their local communities. Some examples of initiatives carried out in 2022.\n\nAirgas is the Group's Industrial Merchant subsidiary in the United States. With nearly 1,400 sites, this subsidiary has a strong presence throughout the country. It is strongly committed to local communities.\n\nWelding is essential to many industries and plays a decisive role in  supporting  the industries  of  today  and tomorrow. It is also  an activity strongly correlated with the industrial gases business. Airgas has therefore been running an educational initiative, 'Airgas' High  School Welding', since 2018 to supports  welding programs. These schools offer students between the ages of 15 and 18 the opportunity to learn  and prepare for a future  career. Young people learn to weld and to understand the importance of safety, reliability and teamwork. Airgas provides financial support and  provides  all the tools they  need  to  carry out  their training: consumables for welding, safety and other equipment, as well as mentoring by  local  Airgas employees who  contribute with their time and expertise in support of the schools.\n\nIn 2022, Airgas  supported 16 new schools across the United States, and renewed support for 20 schools. In recent years, the welding training program has positively impacted more than 450 teachers and 4,200 students.\n\nIn South Korea, Air Liquide Korea launched a mentoring program in partnership with the JUMP association, a local non-profit association whose purpose is to combat educational inequalities. Around 15 Air Liquide Korea employees have agreed to become mentors. 15 students and 62 teenagers benefited from 23 individual or group sessions, i.e. more than 2,600 hours of sharing. This is an experience that brought significant benefits to young people, but also to employees, whose satisfaction was measured at 4.5/5.\n\nIn China, the Air Liquide China subsidiary is also involved in civil society and contributes to several projects. In 2022, for example, it financed the 'Shanghai Young Bakers' association to train young people  aged  17-23  from  disadvantaged  regions  of  China for one year. This French bakery training will enable them to find a job and lead an independent life. The subsidiary also made  a donation to the 'SEE Foundation for protecting Shanghai Chongming Dongtan National Nature Reserve' and organized beach  cleaning  and plastic  bottle  collection  days  with volunteer employees. In the  health  field,  it  also  offered  a  large  amount  of protective equipment (masks, protective clothing, disinfectants, etc.) for volunteers and children in makeshift hospitals to fight against the covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## 7.4. THE ACCESS OXYGEN PROGRAM\n\nDeployed by Air Liquide since 2017, Access Oxygen is an innovative oxygen therapy solution adapted to the rural health structures in these countries. This program is part of the Air Liquide  Group's  sustainable  development objectives  announced in 2021. For more information, please refer to section 5.2.4 Societal initiatives in healthcare (b).",

Relations with the public sphere\n\nAir  Liquide  actively  contributes  to  the  discussions,  consultations and work of public authorities as well as with professional associations, Think Tanks and NGOs (non-governmental organizations), in the Group's areas of expertise.\n\nAir  Liquide has produced and published in 2021 a Public Affairs Charter completed in 2022 and governing the Group's interactions with public authorities at the national, regional/European and international level in order to stay ahead of risks related to regulatory changes, identify growth opportunities, and involve Air Liquide in the public debate on sectors in which the Group has a legitimate interest.\n\nThis policy specifies that the Group will work with stakeholders in a constructive and transparent manner, following ethical rules and respecting political neutrality. All action is conducted in accordance with guidelines on interest representation.\n\nAccordingly, Air  Liquide is listed  (voluntarily since 2011) in the 'Transparency  Register' of European  institutions, in the  French 'Interest Representatives' register, created in 2017 and managed by the High Authority of Transparency in Public Life ( Haute Autorit\u00e9 pour la Transparence de la Vie Publique - HATVP), and in  the Lobbying Disclosure  Act database of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nWorking within the European and International Affairs Department, the team, in conjunction with the various geographical operating entities and the Group's Business Lines, covers the following sectors: energy/hydrogen transition, circular economy, innovation, technologies, digital and health.\n\n- \u25a0 the  energy transition and the environment  by  contributing  to the development of clean energy efficiency and alternative energy vectors (hydrogen, biogas, solar and wind power, etc.), and their applications, especially in terms of industrial decarbonization and mobility; the energy and carbon markets, with regulatory changes and development of markets in Europe, the Americas, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa;\n- \u25a0 public health, with the development of innovative solutions to meet major health  and  socio-demographic  challenges  (aging of the population, increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases, pandemics, increase in demand for healthcare in developing countries). Air Liquide operates in the fields of home healthcare, the supply of medical gases for healthcare facilities, and is involved in the various healthcare ecosystems to increase the value of the care provided to patients;\n- \u25a0 opportunities and risks related to the digitalization of the economy, and geopolitical risks related to cybersecurity;\n\n- \u25a0 the defense of Air Liquide's shareholding model;\n- \u25a0 the contribution of technologies, particularly to space and space exploration in Europe, quantum technology, electronics and semiconductors, among others;\n- \u25a0 environmental and societal reporting challenges.\n\nThe European and International Affairs Department coordinates a network of some 20 'Public Affairs' managers in the Group's main countries of operation. The task of these managers is to monitor public initiatives liable to impact the Group, and to arrange interactions with local and/or regional authorities to defend  Air Liquide's interests or promote our climate and healthcare system solutions. This network allows the Group to work on the consistency of the positions expressed on cross-functional issues such  as  the energy  transition,  the circular  economy,  health and innovation in the various parts of the world.\n\nIt should also be noted that the Group ensures it maintains a good relationship with its respective local tax authorities and is committed to paying taxes in all its countries of operation.\n\nAir Liquide's Public Affairs policy also aims to establish and develop constructive and sustainable relationships, in Air Liquide's various sectors of operation, with:\n\n- \u25a0 public authorities;\n- \u25a0 professional bodies which represent the Group's industry sectors;\n- \u25a0 other actors such as NGOs and think tanks.\n\nThese interactions can take place either directly or through professional bodies such as the World Hydrogen Council, the European Industrial Gases Association (EIGA), the European Round  Table  of Industrialists (ERT) and France Hydrog\u00e8ne. Air Liquide asks all its professional organizations to explicitly support the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn December 2021, Air Liquide published its Public Affairs Charter on its website. It can be  viewed at: https://www.airliquide.com/ investors/documents-presentations.\n\nIn 2022, Air Liquide has  also  carried out  a review of  the main professional organizations of which it is a member in France, in Europe and in the United States, including analyses and assessments of the alignment of their positions with the Group's decarbonization objectives, as well as their commitment to supporting the Paris Agreement. This review and the review process are available on the website: https://www.airliquide.com/ sustainable-development/engagement-public-stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

LIST OF PRODUCTION UNITS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT\n\nThe environmental indicators that are most representative of the Group's activities and part of Air Liquide's Sustainable Development reporting are described below. They cover a total of 657 Air Liquide production units worldwide.\n\n| Type of  production units                             |   Number  of production  units | Applications and environmental footprint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Large Air  Separation Units  (ASUs)                   |                            424 | Large Air Separation Units produce oxygen, nitrogen and argon, with some sites also producing  rare gases such as krypton and xenon. These plants 'without chimneys'  do not  use any combustion processes. They are particularly  environmentally friendly, as they emit no CO2, sulfur oxide (SOx), or nitrogen oxide (NOx). They use electricity almost exclusively: worldwide they use around 4,800 MW equivalent at any  given moment. The electricity purchased from our energy suppliers and consumed by the Air  Separation Units is the source of indirect emissions (Scope  2). The cooling systems of these  units require back-up water.                          |\n| Hydrogen  and carbon  monoxide units  (HyCO)          |                             62 | Large hydrogen and carbon monoxide production units also produce steam for some customers.  The raw material used is primarily natural gas and a quantity of water required for the reaction  that produces hydrogen. Carbon monoxide is an essential raw material in the chemical industry  for producing plastics. The desulfurization of hydrocarbons to produce fuels with reduced sulfur  content is one of the main applications of hydrogen. These units emit CO2 and nitrogen oxides  (NOx),  but  virtually  no  sulfur  oxides  (SOx).  They  also  consume  electricity  and  their  cooling  circuits require back-up water.                                      |\n| Cogeneration units                                    |                             16 | Cogeneration  units  produce  steam  and  electricity  simultaneously.  They  consume  natural  gas  and  water,  mostly  converted  into  steam  and  supplied  to  customers.  The  steam  can  be  condensed  at  these  customers'  facilities  and  then  reused  in  the  cogeneration  unit.  In  most  cases, the electricity produced is supplied to the local electricity distribution network, which in  some  countries  can  be  used  to  power  the  Group's  other  units.  Combustion  of  natural  gas  produces  CO2  and  leads  to  low  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx)  emissions,  but  virtually  no  sulfur  oxide  (SOx) emissions.                         |\n| Acetylene units                                       |                             53 | These units produce acetylene, a gas primarily used in metal welding and cutting. 50 of these  units produce this gas through the decomposition of a solid (calcium carbide) using water. Two  units fill cylinders with this gas, which is supplied by another industrial company. This process  produces  lime,  at  least  90%  of  which  tends  to  be  recycled  in  industrial  and  agricultural  applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Nitrous oxide units                                   |                             11 | Nitrous  oxide  is  used  primarily  as  an  anesthetic  gas  in  the  healthcare  sector  and  as  a  sweetening agent in the food industry. It is produced from ammonium nitrate in solid form or as a  water-based solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Carbon dioxide  liquefaction and  purification units  |                             61 | These units liquefy and purify carbon dioxide, which has many industrial applications, especially  in the food industry, where it is used to deep-freeze foods or produce carbonated beverages. Carbon dioxide is most often a by-product of chemical units operated by other manufacturers. In  certain cases, it is found naturally in underground deposits. In other cases, it comes from the Group's hydrogen and carbon monoxide units. It is purified and  liquefied  in  Air  Liquide  units  consuming  electricity  and  cooling  water.  Carbon  dioxide  is  thus  reused for other industrial applications instead of being emitted directly into the atmosphere. |\n| Production units  for Specialty  Ingredients business |                              5 | These  production  units  for  Specialty  Ingredients  business  are  located  in  France,  China  and  United-States  and  belong  to  Seppic  (Specialty  Ingredients  business).  These  units  consume  natural gas, electricity and water. Combustion of natural gas produces small amounts of CO2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Engineering &  Construction units                     |                              3 | Units  for  the  Engineering  &  Construction  business  taken  into  account  in  this  reporting  are  located at five sites in France, China and the United Arab Emirates. They are mainly used for the  construction of air separation columns and cryogenic tanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Biogas units                                          |                             22 | These units process waste to produce biogas, a renewable energy source. Biogas is produced  during  the  methanization  of  biomass:  household  waste,  industrial  and  agricultural  waste  and  sewage  sludge.  Air  Liquide  is  aware  of  the  potential  of  this  process  in  terms  of  the  energy  transition and is therefore working on global solutions dedicated to the valorization of biogas and  which meet the needs of farmers, waste treatment managers and the agro-industry.                                                                                                                                                                        |",

This variation is also due to the inclusion of new assets in the scope, in particular the assets acquired from Sasol, which  were  integrated into the  CO2  emissions  reporting  scope on  June  24, 2021, which  impacted  the full  year  in  2022.  The corresponding emissions will be reduced in the future thanks to an ambitious plan to procure renewable electricity. As demonstrated by the 220 MW long-term contract of renewable power signed by Air Liquide and Sasol with Enel Green Power, this plan is being concretely implemented.\n\nMore than 80% of the Group's direct emissions in Europe and America due to cogeneration units and hydrogen production capacity.\n\nIndirect emissions are related to installed capacity in various regions and to the local power generation mix. The amount of coal-based power generation in Asia and South Africa explains the relative importance of Scope 2 emissions in these geographies, which represent more than 70% of the Group's indirect emissions.\n\nOn a comparable basis, it is important to note that the Group's emissions have remained stable for the second consecutive year, while activity is growing strongly.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Scope 3\n\nScope 3 emissions correspond to Air Liquide's indirect emissions from its value chain (outside of Scope 2 emissions) and are separated into 15 different categories that can be split between the upstream and the downstream of the value chain.\n\n| Scope 3 categories  (a)                                      | 2021 (in thousands of tonnes CO \u2082 -eq.)   | 2022 (in thousands of tonnes CO \u2082 -eq.)   |     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----|\n| 1 - Purchased goods and services                             | 3,286                                     | 3,161                                     | *   |\n| 2 - Capital goods (b)                                        | 523                                       | 1,035                                     | *   |\n| 3 - Energy (not included Scope 1 or 2)                       | 7,591                                     | 8,749                                     | *   |\n| 4 - Upstream transportation and  distribution                | 83                                        | 541                                       | *   |\n| 6 - Business travel                                          | 30                                        | 49                                        | *   |\n| 7 - Employee commuting                                       | 70                                        | 73                                        | *   |\n| 9 - Downstream transportation (c)                            | 358                                       | Not relevant                              | (c) |\n| 11 - Use of sold products (d)                                | 9,236                                     | 7,282                                     | *   |\n| 13 - Downstream leased assets                                | 1,070                                     | 1,244                                     | *   |\n| TOTAL SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS  (in thousands of tonnes of CO2-eq.) | 22,247                                    | 22,134 *                                  |     |\n\n- (b) The variation between 2021 and 2022 is due to a better allocation of purchasing categories between categories 1 and 2 of Scope 3\n- (c) These emissions were previously reported by Air Liquide in Scope 1 up to 2020, in category 9 in 2021 and will be reported in category 4 from 2022 to better align with the GHG Protocol.\n- (d) From 2022 onwards, these emissions also include downstream emissions related to acetylene sales and residual natural gas sales at refueling stations not yet fully converted to biomethane. In addition, emissions related to sales of biogenic CO2 are no longer included in the total; they represent 0.5 MtCO2-eq.\n\nThe Group's Scope 3 emissions are mainly related to energy (category 3) as well as the use of products sold, especially CO2 and N2O. The Energy category increase in 2022 is due to an increase in the Group's energy consumption during the year and to the impact of the assets acquired from Sasol and including the CO2 emissions reporting scope on June 24, 2021, which will be taking into account for the full year in 2022. In category 11, the addition of emissions related to acetylene sales and residual natural gas sales at refueling stations not yet fully converted to biomethane leads to a marginal increase, which is far more compensated by two effects: on the one hand, the withdrawal of emissions related to biogenic CO2 sales and, on the other hand, the implementation of methodologies allowing to take into account more precisely the part of the products sold that is actually re-emitted during their use by customers.\n\nIn total, Scope 3 emissions are nonetheless slightly down, despite significant growth in sales.\n\n## 2.2.3.

Scopes calculation methodology\n\n## Scope 1\n\nThe majority of Air Liquide's Scope 1 emissions are from its hydrogen production and cogeneration units. Scope 1 emissions are the difference in carbon content between the natural gas consumed by these units and the carbon content of their products. Air Liquide also records direct emissions from the combustion of fuel in its truck fleet, as well as gas losses from its CO2 and nitrous oxide production units.\n\n## Scope 2\n\nAir Liquide now accounts for its Scope 2 emissions on a 'market basis.' Since 2021 the Group has improved the way it accounts for indirect emissions from electricity and steam purchases by moving from a 'location-based' approach based on the average emissions intensity of the national grid to a much more precise and specific approach known as the 'market-based' method, linked directly to supply contracts. In the absence of contractual information, when all or part of a site's electricity supply comes from the grid, a residual emission factor is used, in accordance with best practices. In the absence of reliable data on the residual mix, the grid emission factor is used, the",

The 2022 emissions reflect a full year's impact; nevertheless, the control of the CO2 emissions trajectory and the Group's financial results have allowed the carbon intensity to be stabilized as of 2022. Given  the ambitious decarbonization  plan  of  the Group,  including  for  the  Sasol  project,  this  does not  compromise  the  -30%  carbon intensity reduction objective to reach an intensity of 5.1 kg CO2-eq./euros of Operating income (using \"market-based\" methodology) by 2025 vs. 2015 baseline.\n\n| Indicators                                                                                                                                      | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----|\n| Driver 1: Purchases of renewable electricity  (TWh)  (a)                                                                                        | 5.0    | 5.6    | 6.2    | 5.6    | 6.0    | 6.8    | 7.5    |    |\n| Driver 2: Energy efficiency (ASU)  (b) (c)                                                                                                      | -0.5 % | 1.9%   | 2.2%   | 1.6%   | 0.5%   | -0.1%  | 0.3 %  | *  |\n| Driver 2: Energy efficiency (HyCO)  (b) (d)                                                                                                     | -      | 0.6 %  | -0.2 % | 0.1%   | -0.1 % | -2.0%  | -4.4 % | *  |\n| Driver 3: Operated or decided Electrolyzer  capacity  (e) (f)                                                                                   | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | 65     | 83     |    |\n| Driver 4: Carbon footprint of air gases (N2, O2 and  Air) delivered in bulk, cylinders or On-Site products  (Industrial Merchant activity)  (g) | 302    | 300    | 301    | 282    | 289    | 269    | 276    |    |\n\nThe variation in efficiency for hydrogen production is mainly due to maintenance shutdowns and strong variations in volumes depending on the month of the year.\n\nSeveral medium-sized electrolysis projects have been approved in  2022.

WASTE AND BY-PRODUCTS\n\nAir Liquide wishes to be part of a process of continuous improvement of its environmental footprint regarding waste. To this end, in 2019, the reporting  of  waste  and  by-products  changed to  provide  a  more comprehensive  view  of  the types  of  waste  generated  and their management.\n\nThis approach focuses on the three main hazardous waste groups at each site, allowing a better appreciation of the main environmental impacts associated with waste in each location. This new approach is to be refined in the coming years, in order to provide a view that will allow this environmental footprint to be managed more effectively within the Group.\n\n| Main hazardous waste   | % of sites which mentioned it as one of their  three main hazardous waste categories   | Treatment mode           | Volume concerned         |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Oils                   | 72.7%                                                                                  | Recycling                | 82.7%                    |\n|                        | Incineration with energy                                                               | Incineration with energy | Incineration with energy |\n| Paints and solvents    | 9.6%                                                                                   | recovery                 | 60%                      |\n| Batteries              | 59%                                                                                    | Recycling                | 74%                      |\n\nFor non-hazardous waste, the main waste groups are metal, paper, wood and plastics.

GHG EMISSION QUOTA SYSTEMS\n\nAir Liquide is present in a number of regions that have implemented or are in the process of implementing quota systems for greenhouse gas emissions. These regulatory developments are being followed by the Air Liquide teams to make sure that the Group's activities comply with the obligations associated with these quota systems.\n\n## 4.1.1.  In Europe\n\nIn the European Union, the European ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) directive established a system of greenhouse gas emission quotas in 2005, in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's climate change objectives.  After an initial phase from 2005 to 2007 and a second phase from 2008 to 2012, a third phase, covering the period from 2013 to 2020, has made it possible to expand the scope of industrial facilities subject to  the  ETS. The ETS has entered its fourth phase, covering the period 2021-2030, which carries an increase in the reduction factor. A provisional agreement from December 2022 on the next revision of EU ETS in the context of the Fitfor55 package, assumes the reduction of emissions from the stationary industry by 62% by 2030 compared to 2005.\n\nFor Air Liquide, in 2022, this directive affected all of its cogeneration  sites  in Germany, France and the Netherlands, as well as all of the Group's large hydrogen production sites in Europe. With regard to hydrogen production units, a portion of the CO2 emission quotas is allocated for free according to a benchmark established for the top-performing European facilities. Air Liquide acquires the remaining CO2 quotas from the market or its customers in order to cover the hydrogen production site emissions not covered by the free allocations and for all emissions from cogeneration sites. As hydrogen is expected to be included in new rules called Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), revised ETS rules will lead to gradual phasing-out of the free allowances (to zero in 2034) for hydrogen installation.\n\n## 4.1.2.  In China\n\nFrom 2013, the Chinese government had launched pilot ETS programs  in seven  provinces/cities (Guangdong,  Hubei,  Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen). Four  Air Liquide entities participated in the program. A national carbon market was launched on July 16, 2021. At this stage, it only covers one sector, electricity.  However,  the 2,162  companies it  comprises  produce around 4.5 billion  tonnes  of  carbon  emissions  per  year. In  2022 the market will also include the steel and cement industry. Other industries (such as the chemical industry) are expected to be included in the national system over the next five years. For now, there is  no absolute  cap in the  Chinese carbon  market.  China allocates all  companies  their  emission quotas. The allocation  is based on a national comparative analysis with each emitter allocated quotas equal to their verified emissions. This approach means that China is not yet a cap-and-trade system. Nevertheless, companies that succeed in reducing the carbon intensity  of  their production can generate a surplus of tradeable quotas. At the end of 2022, the average price of CO2 was 60 RMB/ton (8.5 euros per tonne), and since the start of the market in July, 194 million tonnes have been traded.\n\n## 4.1.3.  In Canada\n\nThe federal pricing system has two parts: a regulatory charge on fossil fuels like gasoline and natural gas, known as the fuel charge, and a performance-based system for industries, known as the Output-Based Pricing System (OBPS).\n\nThe Government of Canada has confirmed that the carbon pollution pricing systems in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, and British Columbia continue to meet the federal benchmark stringency requirements, and  as  of  2021, New Brunswick  has  a  carbon pollution pricing system that also meets the benchmark requirements. As of January 1, 2022, Ontario's provincial output-based pricing system will apply alongside the federal fuel charge.\n\nAir Liquide Canada is a market participant in the Quebec cap-andtrade system, a voluntary participant in the Ontario provincial OBPS and a mandatory participant in the Alberta provincial OBPS.\n\n## 4.1.4.  In Kazakhstan\n\nThe  national  quota  allocation plan for  2021  came into effect  on January 13, 2021. A revised version came into effect on January 1,  2022. A  revised  version came into force on January 1, 2022. The emissions trading system (ETS) applies to all direct emitters of more 20,000 tCO2/year.\n\n## 4.1.5.  In California\n\nThe California GHG Cap-and-Trade system was established through the  Assembly  Bill  32 (AB32) for  the period  2013-2020, and the first  compliance period  started  in  2013.  In  2017,  a  new bill, AB398, authorizes the California Air Resource Board (CARB) to continue enforcing the Cap-and-Trade regulation over the period 2021 through 2030. The fundamentals of the AB32 remain unchanged with AB39.\n\n## 4.1.6.  Synthesis\n\nOther countries, such as South Korea have also implemented a national emission quota exchange system. In 2018, a CO2 taxation system was put in place in Singapore.\n\n|                                        | 2022                  | 2022                  |                       |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| System (in thousands of tonnes of CO \u2082 | Allowances  Allocated | Allowances  Purchased | Allowances  Purchased |\n| California CaT                         | 1,042                 | 246                   | (a)                   |\n| EU ETS  (b)                            | 2,554                 | 2,946                 |                       |\n| Kazakhstan ETS                         | 222                   | -                     | (a)                   |\n| Korea ETS                              | 215                   | -                     | (a)                   |\n| China ETS  (c)                         | 1,428                 | 8                     | (a)                   |\n| Canada ETS                             | 601                   | -                     |                       |\n\n- (a) Estimates pending validation by local authorities.\n- (b) Taking into account the joint ventures for which the Group's partners are responsible for purchasing the allocations.\n- (c) On Scopes 1 and 2.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2. MARKET AUTHORIZATION REGULATIONS\n\nThe distribution of substances, products and articles is part of the product stewardship approach developed by the chemical industry.\n\nIn terms of market authorizations, Air Liquide is mainly affected by four regulations: chemical substances (REACH), biocidal products (BPR), plant protection products (PPP) and fluorinated gases (Fgas).\n\n## 4.2.1.  European REACH regulation Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006\n\nREACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of CHemicals) is a European Union regulation that governs the registration,  notification,  restriction  and  authorisation  of  chemical substances produced in or imported into the European Union. Air Liquide also ensures that the raw materials used and placed on the market comply with the REACH regulation.\n\n## REACH registration of chemical substances\n\nAny chemical substance imported into or manufactured in Europe in excess of one ton per year must be registered with the European Chemicals Agency, ECHA. Each manufacturer or importer must have its own registration.\n\nThe European REACH regulation came into effect  in  2007, and the registration procedures for existing substances manufactured or imported in excess of one ton per year were scheduled to run until May 31, 2018. After this date, the obligations relating to the maintenance and updating of files continue in the event of production or import in a higher tonnage band, during the review of registration files by the authorities, during administrative updates and when new information  on risks to  humans or the environment comes to light.\n\nThe same obligations will  apply  to  all  new  substances from the first ton produced or imported into Europe.\n\nAir Liquide's main products, such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, CO2, helium and rare gases, are exempt from registration under REACH.\n\nAir Liquide is lead registrant for several substances, in particular specialty gases for the Electronics business (NF3, CF4, C4F8, SiF4\u2026). Air Liquide is ordinary registrant for several other substances: carbon monoxide, acetylene, methanol, lime, nitrous oxide, ultra-pure fuels have been registered under this regulation by each subsidiary concerned.\n\nIn addition, Seppic, manufacturers of specialty ingredients for health and beauty, is subject to REACH regulations for some of its substances. Seppic has anticipated the implementation of the European REACH regulation and ensures continued compliance with the regulation. In parallel with the European dossiers submitted within the framework of the REACH regulation, Seppic also ensures compliance with similar regulations outside Europe.\n\nIn 2022, Group sales subject to registration under REACH represent less than 1% of Group revenue.\n\n## Restriction under REACH of the use of chemical substances\n\nAir Liquide is mainly impacted by restrictions relating to the use of solvents used to distribute acetylene. The solvent DMF is subject to a restriction under a European regulation of November 2021 that requires occupational exposure during cylinder filling operations to be monitored. NMP, a potential substitute, is also subject to restricted use as of May 2020.\n\n## Authorization under REACH: transitional authorization of chemical substances\n\nTransitional authorizations before permanent cessation of use in Europe apply to SVHC (Substances of Very High Concern) substances included in the candidate list for authorization.\n\nAir Liquide does not distribute substances subject to authorization. These SVHCs are essentially contained in articles distributed for the commissioning or production of gases.\n\n## Notification under REACH of articles manufactured, imported or distributed\n\nNotification to the European  Chemicals Agency  of any SVHCs, listed in the candidate list, is mandatory when the product concentration is greater than 0.1% by weight and if the total imported or produced exceeds one ton per year.\n\nSuch SVHCs are contained in the articles for gas commissioning or gas production.\n\nIn the  case  of  complex items,  composed  of  several  elementary items, the 1% threshold applies to the most elementary part and not to the complex whole.\n\nThe presence of such SVHC must also be communicated during any distribution of these articles to professionals or industry. Communication to individuals is only applicable if a consumer explicitly requests it.\n\n## Notification in the SCIP database of items placed on the market\n\nThe WFD (Waste Framework Directive) requires distributors of articles containing SVHCs, as defined by REACH, above 0.1% by weight, to fill out a database  called SCIP, where  the article is described and the location of the SVHC substance is designated. There is no threshold limit as for REACH notifications.\n\nAir Liquide as a supplier of articles  and equipment,  medical or non-medical (e.g. freezing tunnels) is concerned.\n\nThis SCIP  database  will be used  at  the end  of  the article's life when it is dismantled by waste treatment or recycling centers as part of the circular economy.\n\nAir Liquide now requires its equipment suppliers to inform it of the presence and precise location of all elementary parts containing SVHCs.\n\n## 4.2.2.  Biocide Regulation (BPR-2012) and Plant Protection Products Regulation (PPP-2009)\n\nThese old regulations (2012 BPR and 2009 PPP), applicable throughout  Europe,  are  often  accompanied  by  national  decrees on phytosanitary products. Gases such as CO2 are often used in pesticides or disinfectants, replacing chemicals that are banned in Europe.\n\nThese two regulations require an approval of the substance at the European level, prior to the application for national authorization.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The renewals are now due in 2022 and 2023 respectively following a delay in the file review process due to a government backlog.\n\nAfter approval, the internal distribution channels, or supply chain, will have to be reviewed because the sources of these BPR and PPP products require sourcing exclusively from the sources that have either been referenced in the approval file or given technical equivalence when the file was submitted.\n\nUnder BPR, the review of the Ozone approval file is still in progress. Once approved, the appropriate requests for authorization both for the  use in industrial facilities and for the marketing  of  its precursor,  oxygen,  will  then  be submitted.  This concerns applications for water purification, container disinfection and industrial water treatment.\n\nThe BPR and PPP regulations also impose additional labeling obligations.\n\n## 4.2.3.  Regulation F-GAS (2014) Regulation (EU) No. 517/2014\n\nThis European regulation only applies to fluorinated gases placed on the market within the Union. It imposes marketing quotas on HFC (hydrofluorocarbon)-type  gases  because of their very high global warming potential. The other gases concerned by this regulation are monitored and are therefore subject to a reporting obligation.\n\nAir Liquide mainly markets this type of gas for the electronics and medical sectors. Fluorinated gases used in the electronics sector are destroyed before discharge into the atmosphere and therefore their use is exempted from the quota system.\n\n## 4.2.4.  Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals\n\nThe Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of  Chemicals, better known as GHS, was created by the United\n\n## 5. Reporting methodology\n\n## 5.1. PROTOCOL AND DEFINITIONS\n\nIn the absence of a relevant and recognized protocol for industrial gas operations, Air Liquide has created its own protocol to define its reporting methods for Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators. This protocol includes all of the definitions,  measurement  procedures  and collection  methods for this information. In line with the Group's commitment to continuous improvement, Air Liquide is gradually completing this work to adjust its Sustainable Development indicators protocol to reflect changes in the Group.\n\nThis protocol  is  based  on  the general  principles defined  by the Group with  regard to scope,  responsibilities, controls  and  limits, and establishes definitions, departmental responsibilities, tools and data-tracing methods for each indicator. This document is regularly updated.\n\nNations. This system sets out the classification of chemical products according to the types of danger that they represent and provides standardized hazard information, including labeling.\n\nThis labeling must provide key information concerning health, safety and environmental protection to  everyone  who  handles  a hazardous product or who could be exposed to one.\n\nIn the countries in which GHS is implemented in local regulations, Air Liquide subsidiaries have implemented the principles of GHS in terms of product compliance in accordance with the requirements set out in local regulations.\n\n## 4.2.5.  Notification to Poisons Centers (Regulation 1272/2008/EC, Annex VIII)\n\nThe notification to the national emergency services (Poison Centers) of the composition and numbers of any mixture placed on the market is mandatory from January 1, 2021 in Europe for products intended for consumer or trade use, and from January 1, 2024 for those intended for industrial use.\n\nThis process requires obtaining a unique identification number (UFI code) at the European level, which must also be indicated on the labels of bottles and products. Transit through a depot center also requires a UFI code in the country concerned.\n\n## 4.2.6.  Seveso Directive 3\n\nThis European directive concerns the prevention of major industrial risks. It applies to any facility where certain hazardous substances are present above certain quantities. These facilities are classified into two categories according to the quantity of substances present: Seveso 3 'upper tier' and 'lower tier.' In Europe,  94  'lower  tier'  and 28 'upper  tier' Air  Liquide  sites are concerned, mainly because of oxygen storage.\n\nSeveso regulations apply mainly in Europe, but if the Seveso 'upper tier' criteria were to be applied worldwide, 83 other Group sites would be covered.\n\nMoreover, this protocol takes into account all the Group's formalized procedures in the framework of the Industrial Management System (IMS) and the global protocol for Group Policies, Codes and Procedures called the BlueBook. This reporting protocol makes it possible to cover the information listed in articles L. 22-10-36 and R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code, except for the fight against food waste, food insecurity, respect for animal welfare, commitments to responsible, fair and sustainable food and the promotion  of the practice of physical activities  and  sports.  Due  to  its  industrial  activity,  these  subjects are not considered a priority by Air Liquide.\n\nIn 2021, following the publication of enhanced Sustainable Development objectives, new indicators were developed for monitoring the corresponding action plans and the degree to which the objectives are achieved.",

SCOPE AND CONSOLIDATION METHODS\n\nHuman Resources and environmental indicators are consolidated worldwide for all companies integrated within the financial consolidation scope. Entities accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the reporting scope.\n\nSafety indicators are consolidated worldwide for all companies in which  Air Liquide has operational control or is responsible for safety management.\n\nApart from these general rules, there are some specific ones:\n\n- \u25a0 information on the impact of transportation (kilometers traveled, CO2 emitted) is calculated based on data collected in the main countries where the Group is established;\n- \u25a0 information on avoided kilometers and avoided CO2 emissions through on-site Air Separation Units and efficiency measures pertains  to  fully  consolidated subsidiaries  within the  financial consolidation scope;\n- \u25a0 environmental and energy indicators for the main types of production units operated  by the  Group  cover  about  99%  of the Group's Gas & Services revenue and 98% of the Group's total revenue;\n- \u25a0 for  environmental and energy indicators, production units are included in the reporting system from the effective date of their industrial commissioning;\n- \u25a0 electricity consumption and the indirect CO2 emissions related to it are only taken into account when Air Liquide pays for this energy. Energy consumption of on-site units and water consumption specific to the sale of treated water (which is not part of the Group's core business) are excluded from the consolidation scope of the data. When the Group has cogeneration units in a country where ASUs are available, the indirect emissions from the electricity of these units are adjusted to take into account self-consumption;\n- \u25a0 the segmentation between advanced economies and developing economies, used for direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, is the same as that  used  by  the Finance Department;\n- \u25a0 the 2020 base used to monitor the targeted -33% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2035 has been restated following significant changes in  the  scope  regarding  industrial  gas  manufacturing units;\n- \u25a0 the avoided CO2 emissions reported on the climate benefit of using hydrogen to desulfurize fuels due to lower black carbon emissions are calculated using methodologies widely used by the industries reporting these climate benefits, and via extrapolations to Group data.\n\n## 5.3. DATA COLLECTION AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators are produced by several data collection systems in the Group, each under the responsibility of a specific department:\n\n- \u25a0 Human Resources indicators, included in the Group's general accounting  consolidation tool, fall under the  responsibility  of the Human Resources Department;\n\n- \u25a0 the energy consumption and CO2 emissions indicators for the main Air Separation Units and cogeneration, hydrogen and carbon monoxide units are tracked by the Large Industries business line using a dedicated Intranet tool;\n- \u25a0 as a complement, environmental and safety reporting is carried  out by the  Safety  and Industrial  System Department using a dedicated Intranet tool, and includes:\n- -for all entities, the Group's accident reporting data,\n- -for the units  of the  Large  Industries business line, other environmental indicators (atmospheric emissions, water consumption, discharge to water, etc.),\n- -for  the  smaller units (acetylene, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide units and Hygiene and Specialty Ingredients businesses), the Engineering & Construction business units, the Research and Development sites and the Technical Centers, all indicators (energy, atmospheric emissions, water consumption, discharge to water, etc.);\n- \u25a0 indicators on Industrial Merchant transportation are the responsibility of this business line;\n- \u25a0 indicators on transportation for Medical Gases and Home Healthcare  are  the responsibility of the Healthcare business line;\n- \u25a0 among the subjects covered by the French 'Grenelle  2'  law, soil  pollution  and  the consideration of  noise  pollution  are  not relevant for the Industrial Gas business, given the size of the Group's sites and the noise levels generated. They are therefore not mentioned in this report.\n\n## 5.4. CONTROLS\n\nEach department in charge of collecting data is responsible for the indicators provided. Control occurs  at the  time of  consolidation (review of changes, inter-entity comparisons).\n\nCompliance with the  CO2  trajectory is ensured by the Finance Department with the support of the Sustainable Development Department through the management and monitoring of CO2 budgets, as part of a reporting process with responsibilities clearly assigned to the various entities involved (operations for data collection, industrial management teams for verification and variance analysis by the Finance Department)\n\nSafety and energy indicators are tracked monthly. Where the data reported are inconsistent or missing, an estimated value may be used by default.\n\n## 5.5. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITS\n\nThe methodologies used for certain Human Resources, safety and environmental indicators can have certain limits due to:\n\n- \u25a0 the absence of nationally or internationally recognized definitions, in particular for indicators on managers and professionals and social performance indicators;\n- \u25a0 the representativeness of the measurements taken and required estimates. This is particularly the case for indicators regarding avoided CO2 emissions, water consumption, kilometers avoided per on-site unit, and training.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Resolutions within the authority of the Ordinary General Meeting\n\nWe ask you, after having reviewed:\n\n- \u25a0 the Reports of the Board of Directors;\n- \u25a0 the Company's Financial Statements, income statement, balance sheet and notes thereto;\n- \u25a0 the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- \u25a0 the Reports of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nto approve the Company's financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 as presented, as well as the transactions set out in these financial statements or mentioned in these reports.\n\nYour Company's net profit allows the Board to propose the payment of a dividend of 2.95 euros for each share entitled to a dividend,  it  being  specified  that  in  the  event of a  change  in  the number of shares entitled to a dividend compared to the 523,450,271 shares making up the share capital as of December 31, 2022, the overall dividend amount would be adjusted accordingly and the amount appropriated to the retained earnings account would be determined on the basis of the dividends effectively paid.\n\nThe proposed dividend is 2.95 euros per share, representing an increase of +12.2% compared to 2021. The level of this dividend should be assessed taking into account the allocation of one free share for 10 existing shares on June 8, 2022.\n\nThe ex-dividend date will be set for May 15, 2023. The dividend payment date will be set for May 17, 2023.\n\nIn accordance with article 117 quater of the French Tax Code, it is specified that ordinary and loyalty dividends  paid to  individuals with their  tax  residence  in France are fully  subject  to  the  single flat-rate withholding  tax  of  12.8%.  Nonetheless,  at the  express,\n\nirrevocable and global request of the Shareholder, these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall  therefore  be eligible for the  40% allowance  referred  to in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French Tax Code, which  is  applicable under  certain conditions.  In  all cases, these ordinary and loyalty dividends shall also be subject to social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.\n\nIn addition, Shareholders who have held their shares in registered form for  at  least  two  years  as  of  December 31,  2022,  and  who retain such shares in registered form up to the dividend payment date, shall be entitled, for such shares (i.e.  a total number of 149,161,232 shares at December 31, 2022), to a loyalty dividend of 10% compared with the dividend paid to the other shares, i.e. an additional dividend of 0.29 euros per share.\n\nThe difference between the loyalty dividend calculated on the number of shares known to exist at December 31, 2022, and the loyalty dividend actually paid will be allocated to the retained earnings account.\n\nWe also ask you to take due note of distributable earnings for the fiscal year.  Such  amount includes profits  for fiscal  year  2022  of 924,659,026 euros plus available retained earnings at December 31, 2022, of 4,356,827,596 euros, i.e. a total of 5,281,486,622 euros.\n\nWe propose  to appropriate the distributable earnings for fiscal year 2022, i.e. 5,281,486,622 euros, as follows:\n\n| Legal reserve                             | 26,487,579 euros    |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Retained earnings                         | 3,667,563,986 euros |\n| Dividend (including the loyalty dividend) | 1,587,435,057 euros |\n\n## Distribution\n\nIn accordance with French law, we wish to remind you that the distributions made in respect of the last three fiscal years were as follows:\n\nDividend distributed eligible in its entirety for the 40%\n\n|                   | Total amount  distributed  (a) (in euros)   | Number of shares  concerned  (b)   | deduction referred to in article 158-3-2\u00b0  of the French Tax Code  (c) (in euros)   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fiscal year 2019  |                                             |                                    |                                                                                     |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,277,384,888                               | 473,105,514                        | 2.70                                                                                |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 36,221,817                                  | 134,154,877                        | 0.27                                                                                |\n| Fiscal year 2020  |                                             |                                    |                                                                                     |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,302,566,991                               | 473,660,724                        | 2.75                                                                                |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 35,573,380                                  | 131,753,261                        | 0.27                                                                                |\n| Fiscal year 2021  |                                             |                                    |                                                                                     |\n| Ordinary dividend | 1,378,344,007                               | 475,291,037                        | 2.90                                                                                |\n| Loyalty dividend  | 39,148,116                                  | 134,993,503                        | 0.29                                                                                |\n\n- (a) Theoretical values calculated based on the number of shares as of December 31 for each fiscal year.\n- (b) Number of shares expressed historically as of December 31 for each fiscal year.\n\nThe amounts effectively paid after adjustment were as follows:\n\n- - fiscal year 2019 - ordinary dividend: 1,273,544,632 euros for 471,683,197 shares; loyalty dividend: 36,437,830 euros for 134,954,926 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2020 - ordinary dividend: 1,298,589,273 euros for 472,214,281 shares; loyalty dividend: 37,480,931 euros for 138,818,263 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2021 - ordinary dividend: 1,372,465,400 euros for 473,263,931 shares; loyalty dividend: 39,396,398 euros for 135,849,648 shares.\n\nThe adjustment especially arises from the change in the number of treasury shares, from the final determination of the loyalty dividend taking into account shares sold between January 1 and the ex-dividend date, from the exercise of options over this same period and the capital increase reserved for employees.\n\n- (c) Applicable, under certain conditions, when the progressive income tax rate is applied.",

Information on the completion of the Company's share buyback program (pursuant to article L. 225-211 of the French Commercial Code)\n\nThe  Combined  General Meeting  of  May  4,  2022  authorized  the Board, for a period of 18 months, in accordance with articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the directly applicable  provisions of EC Regulation No.  596/2014  of April 16, 2014, to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them;\n- \u25a0 tender them following the exercise of rights attached to marketable securities conferring entitlement to Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions reserved for members of a Company Savings Plan, performed through the transfer of shares acquired previously by the Company, or providing for a free share grant in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) allocation of shares to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company and affiliated companies, in accordance with the laws and regulations in force;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a market liquidity contract in accordance with an Ethics Charter recognized by the  French financial market authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers).\n\nThe buyback by the Company of its own shares was also intended to enable the implementation of any market practice permitted by the French financial market authority and, more generally, the achievement of any other transaction which would comply with the regulations in force.\n\nThe  maximum purchase  price  was  set  at  250 euros  per share, and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back was set  at 10% of the  total number of shares making  up the  share capital as of December 31, 2021, namely 47,529,103 shares for a maximum total amount of 11,882,275,750.00 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nThese shares may be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock exchange, over-the-counter, including the purchase of blocks of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of the final paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nPursuant to this authorization and the previous delegation authorized by the Combined General Meeting of May 4, 2021,\n\n- \u25a0 pursuant to the liquidity contract, the following movements occurred:\n- -856,875 shares were purchased for a total price of 120,801,707 euros, or an average purchase price of 140.98 euros,\n- -854,080 shares were sold for a total price of 120,776,178 euros, or an average purchase price of 141.41 euros;\n- \u25a0 on March 23, 2022, under the share buy-back program, 1,200,000 shares were bought back for a total amount of 190,783,440.00 euros,  i.e.  an  average price  of  158.99  euros per share, representing 0.25% of the share capital as of 31 d\u00e9cembre 2021.\n\nNo other shares were bought before the end of fiscal year 2022.\n\nThe total cost of the buybacks was thus limited to 190,783,440.00 euros.\n\nThe total amount of the transaction fees (exclusive of taxes) was 0.2 million euros.\n\n- \u25a0 In addition, during the fiscal year, the Company proceeded to the tender of treasury shares to beneficiaries of performance share plans as follows:\n- -251,577 shares vested under the 2018 performance share plan ('World' Plan),\n- -105,462 shares vested under the 2019 performance share plan ('France' Plan).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company directly owned 951,833 shares at an average purchase price of 121.07 euros, i.e. a balance sheet value of 115,241,373 euros. These shares, each with a par value of 5.50 euros, represent 0.18% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe 951,833 treasury shares are fully assigned for implementation of any performance share plans or employee shareholding operations.\n\nUnder the liquidity contract, as of December 31, 2022, a total of 10,500 shares were on the balance sheet for a net value of 1,404,536 euros.\n\n## B. Draft resolution\n\nAs the authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2022 was partially used, the Board proposes to replace it with a new authorization to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the eighteenth resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender them following the exercise of rights attached to marketable securities conferring entitlement to Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions reserved for members of a Company Savings Plan,  performed  under  the terms and conditions  set  forth in articles  L.  3331-1  et  seq.  of  the  French  Labor  Code  through the transfer of shares bought back previously by the Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company or affiliated companies;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a  liquidity  contract  in  accordance  with  the  market  practice recognized by the French financial market authority.\n- The buy-back by the Company of its own shares shall be also intended to enable the implementation of any market practice permitted by the French financial market authority and, more generally, the achievement of any other transaction which would comply  with  the regulations  in  force.  In  this case, the Company would inform its Shareholders by means of a press release.\n\nThe maximum purchase price will be set at 250 euros (excluding acquisition costs) per share with a par value of 5.50 euros, and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back will be set  at 10% of the  total number of shares making  up the  share capital as of December 31, 2022, or 52,345,027 shares with a par value of 5.50 euros, for a maximum total amount of 13,086,256,750 euros, subject to the legal limits.",

        "page_content": "## Board of Directors' report on the resolutions presented to the Combined General Meeting - May 3, 2023\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid  periods. These shares may thus be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all  available means,  either on  or off  a  stock exchange,  over-the-counter,  including the  purchase of blocks  of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of the final paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any manner on or off a stock exchange or over-the-counter, including the sale  of blocks of shares, in accordance with the applicable regulations.\n\nAs own shares do not confer entitlement to a dividend, the amount of the unpaid dividends will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThis authorization shall be granted for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting. It shall be valid as of the date of the Board of Directors meeting called to decide on the implementation of the share buyback program and, at the latest, as  of  November  4,  2023.  It  supersedes the  authorization granted by the Ordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2022, in its fourth resolution with respect to its non-utilized portion.\n\n## Appointment of four Directors and Ratification of the temporary appointment of one Director\n\nThe Board of Directors currently comprises twelve members: nine members appointed by the General Meeting and one member coopted by the Board, including four foreign nationals and five women (i.e. 50%), and two Directors representing the employees. The percentage of independent Directors is 80%.\n\nThe terms of office of Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones and Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger expire at the end of this Meeting.\n\nOn the recommendation of the  Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board took note of the wishes of Ms Si\u00e2n HerbertJones and Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger not to  be candidates for the renewal of their respective terms of office. Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones was warmly thanked for her contribution, during her 12 years in office, to the work of the Board of Directors and for her very active involvement in the Audit and Accounts Committee, of which she was a member since 2013 and chaired since May 2015. Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger was warmly thanked for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors since 2015, as well as her participation in the Environment and Society Committee, of which she was a member since its creation in 2017.\n\nYour Board of Directors also decided, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, in accordance with the selection procedure conducted by the latter,  to  propose the appointment of four new Directors. These proposals are in line with the  Board's  diversity  policy,  aimed in  particular  at  reflecting the Group's  international character  and  its diversity of  cultures and nationalities, and having a range of complementary skills and expertise, both sectoral and cross-functional (particularly financial and  CSR). Thus, under the terms of the 5 th , 6 th , 7 th and 8 th resolutions, it is proposed that you appoint as Directors, for terms of four years, Ms Catherine Guillouard, Ms Christina Law, Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat and Mr Michael H. Thaman.\n\nMs Catherine Guillouard, former Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of RATP until September 2022 and previously Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Rexel, Chief Financial Officer of Eutelsat and Air France, will bring to the Board her extensive financial skills as well as her experience as an executive in a major public transport group, where she led the transformation and decarbonization plan.\n\nMs Christina Law, a Chinese national (Hong Kong) and based in Singapore, will bring to the Board her in-depth knowledge of Asian markets, and her managerial experience in large international groups specializing in the fields of healthcare and treatment.\n\nPresident of the Consumer Products Division of the L'Or\u00e9al group, the group's main division, Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat will bring to the Board his knowledge of consumer product markets and his managerial experience within a leading international group, where he has been one of the driving forces behind major transformations carried out in recent years.\n\nAn American national, Mr Michael H. Thaman has extensive knowledge of North American industrial markets as well as a strong international profile. He brings nearly 30 years of experience, including 13 years as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and 18 years as Executive Chairman of Owens Corning, a world leader in construction materials and one of the highest-rated American groups on environmental and societal criteria, and his experience as a Director in other major global listed US groups, particularly in the field of renewable energies.\n\nIn addition, your Board took note of the resignation, on January 3, 2023, of Ms Anette Bronder, Director since May 2020, due to her wish to  take an executive  position with an  audit  firm,  which is incompatible with the maintenance of  her  office as a Director of L'Air Liquide S.A. The Appointments and Governance Committee conducted  a selection process with the support of an external firm. At the end of this process, the Board of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Committee, appointed, by way of co-option (within the meaning of Article 225-24 of the French Commercial Code) for the remaining term of office of Ms Anette Bronder, i.e. until the end of the 2024 General Meeting, Ms Monica de Virgiliis (1) as a Director of the Company. An Italian and French national, Ms Monica de Virgiliis will bring to the Board her experience of more than 15 years in the Electronics business, her skills in the field of technology and energy, and her commitment to energy transition. Under the terms of the 9 th resolution, you are asked to ratify this co-option.\n\nThe Board considers that the members proposed to the vote are independent and have the required availability. At the end of this General Meeting, subject to approval by the General Meeting of all the resolutions, the Board of Directors would therefore comprise fourteen  members:  twelve  members  appointed  by the General Meeting, most of whom are independent (i.e. 83% independent Directors), including five women (i.e. 42%), five foreign nationals and two Directors representing the employees.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholders shall have, in proportion to the number of shares they hold, a preferential subscription right to the shares or the marketable securities thus issued.\n\nThe Group did not make use of the previous authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2021.\n\nThis delegation is valid for a period of 26 months.\n\nThe total amount of the share capital increases that may be carried out under the 20 th resolution below and resolutions allowing employees and Company Officers to benefit from shares (20 th and 21 st resolutions of the Extraordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2022) and resolutions allowing the implementation of employees share ownership transactions (21 st and 22 nd resolutions submitted to this General Meeting, subject to their approval) will also be deducted from this limit of 470 million euros.\n\nAs in 2021, in order to provide Shareholders with the right to express an opinion on the issues that are the subject of this delegation during periods of takeover bids, it is proposed that this delegation of authority be suspended during periods of takeover bids.\n\nIn the event of oversubscription,  the 20 th resolution allows the amount  of the  issue initially provided for to be increased  by  a maximum of 15% (legal limit), subject to a maximum of 470 million euros.\n\n## Capital increase reserved for employees with cancellation of Shareholder preferential subscription rights\n\nIn accordance with  legal provisions, these draft resolutions  are submitted again to the vote at the General Meeting. The two resolutions proposed to the General Meeting are identical to those approved on May 4, 2022.\n\nShareholders, having read the Board of Directors' Report and the Statutory Auditors' Special Report, are therefore asked to authorize the  Board of Directors to  decide  one or  more share capital increases, at the time or times and in the proportions that it deems appropriate, via the  issuance of ordinary shares of the Company, as well as other marketable securities granting access to the Company's share capital, reserved for:\n\n- \u25a0 under the 21 st resolution, the members, from the Company and the French or foreign companies which are affiliated to it within the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-180  of  the French Commercial Code  and article  L.  3344-1  of the  French  Labor Code,  of  a Company or Group Savings Plan (directly or through a Company mutual fund or any other structures or entities permitted by applicable legal or regulatory provisions). The delegation shall be valid for a  period of 26 months starting from the date of this General Meeting;\n- \u25a0 under the 22 th resolution,  a  category of beneficiaries, defined as any bank or subsidiary of such an institution mandated by the Company, which would subscribe to shares, or other share capital issued by the Company pursuant to the 22 nd resolution, with the sole intent of enabling employees and corporate officers of foreign companies, affiliated to the Company within the  meaning  of  article  L.  225-180  of  the French Commercial Code and article L. 3344-1 of the French Labor Code, to benefit from a plan with an economic profile comparable to an employee  share ownership scheme that would be  set  up in connection with a share capital increase undertaken in accordance with  the 21 st resolution  of this  General Meeting, taking into account the regulatory and fiscal and/or social framework applicable in the country of residence of the employees and corporate officers of the aforementioned foreign companies. The delegation shall be valid for a period of 18 months starting from the date of this General Meeting.\n\nThe  Board of  Directors shall  be  competent  to  determine, within those categories, the identity of the beneficiaries of these share capital increases.\n\n<!-- image -->",

loyalty dividend: 36,437,830 euros for 134,954,926 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2020 - ordinary dividend: 1,298,589,273 euros for 472,214,281 shares; loyalty dividend: 37,480,931 euros for 138,818,263 shares;\n- - fiscal year 2021 - ordinary dividend: 1,372,465,400 euros for 473,263,931 shares; loyalty dividend: 39,396,398 euros for 135,849,648 shares.\n\nThe adjustment especially arises from the change in the number of treasury shares, from the final determination of the loyalty dividend taking into account shares sold between January 1 and the ex-dividend date, from the exercise of options over this same period and the capital increase reserved for employees.\n\n- (c) Applicable, under certain conditions, when the progressive income tax rate is applied.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of the articles of association, a loyalty dividend of 10%,  i.e. 0.29  euros per share with a par value  of 5.50 euros, shall be granted to shares which have been held in registered form since December 31, 2020, and which remain held in this form continuously until May 17, 2023 the dividend payment date.\n\nIn accordance with article 117 quater of the French Tax Code, it is specified that ordinary and loyalty dividends  paid to  individuals with their  tax  residence  in France are fully  subject  to  the  single flat-rate withholding  tax  of  12.8%.  Nonetheless, at the  express, irrevocable and global request of the Shareholder, these dividends may be subject to the progressive income tax rate and shall  therefore  be eligible for the  40% allowance  referred  to in section 2\u00b0 of paragraph 3 of article 158 of the French Tax Code, which  is  applicable  under  certain conditions.  In  all cases, these ordinary and loyalty dividends shall also be subject to social contributions at a rate of 17.2%.\n\nThe total amount of the loyalty dividend for the 149,161,232 shares which have been held in registered form since December 31, 2020, and which remained held in this form continuously until December 31, 2022, amounts to 43,256,757 euros.\n\nThe total loyalty dividend corresponding to those of the 149,161,232 shares that cease to be held in registered form between January 1, 2023 and the May 17, 2023 dividend payment date, shall be deducted from the aforementioned amount.",

        "page_content": "## Resolution 4 Buyback by the Company of its own shares\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe 4 th resolution renews the authorization granted to the Board of Directors, for a term of 18 months, to allow the Company to buy back its own shares (including under a liquidity contract). The objectives of the share buyback program are detailed below in the 4 th resolution and  the buyback program description included in the 2022 Universal  Registration Document  available on the Company's  website, prior to the General Meeting. www.airliquide.com,\n\nIn 2022, the buyback program resulted in the purchase of 1,200,000 shares, representing 0.25% of the capital at December 31, 2021, and the cancellation of 1,098,900 shares. Over the past 10 years, share buybacks have represented on average less than 0.5% of the share capital per year.\n\nAdditionally, under the liquidity contract: 856,875 shares were purchased and 854,080 were sold in fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 10,500 shares were held under the liquidity contract.\n\nAs  of December 31,  2022, the Company directly  owned  951,833  shares, fully assigned to the objective of implementation of any performance share plans. These shares represent 0.18% of the Company's share capital. They do not have any voting rights and their related dividends are allocated to retained earnings.\n\nThe  authorization  referred  to  in the  4 th resolution  provides  that the  maximum  purchase  price  is  set  at  250 euros per  share  and the maximum number of shares that can be bought back is limited to 10% of the total number of shares comprising the share capital as of December 31, 2022, i.e. 52,345,027 shares, for a maximum total amount of 13,086,256,750 euros.\n\nIn keeping with previous practices, the Board of Directors intends to use this authorization for the purpose of employee share ownership transactions,  in particular  for  the purpose  of  performance share plans  in favor of employees and Executive Officers.  Subject to  the approval of the 18 th resolution, treasury shares may also be canceled to offset, in the long term, the dilutive impact resulting from capital increases relating to employee share ownership transactions.\n\nThe Board also intends to maintain the liquidity contract in place, in accordance with the French financial market authority regulations.\n\nAs in previous years, the resolution stipulates that the authorization does not apply during takeover bid periods.\n\n## Fourth Resolution\n\n## (Authorization granted to the Board of Directors for a period of 18 months to allow the Company to trade in its own shares)\n\nThe General Meeting, deliberating according to the quorum and majority required for Ordinary General Meetings, after having noted the  Report  of  the Board  of  Directors,  in accordance with articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code and the directly applicable provisions of European Commission Regulation No. 596/2014 of April 16, 2014, authorizes the Board of Directors to allow the Company to repurchase its own shares in order to:\n\n- \u25a0 cancel them, subject to the adoption of the eighteenth resolution;\n- \u25a0 tender them following the exercise of rights attached to marketable securities conferring entitlement to Company shares by redemption, conversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other means;\n- \u25a0 implement (i) any share purchase option plans or (ii) plans for free share attributions, or (iii) any employee share ownership transactions reserved for members of a Company Savings Plan,  performed  under  the terms and  conditions  set  forth in articles  L. 3331-1 et  seq.  of  the  French  Labor  Code  through the transfer of shares bought back previously by the Company under this resolution, or providing for free share attributions in respect of a contribution in shares by the Company and/or to replace the discount, or (iv) share grants to employees and/or Executive Officers of the Company or affiliated companies;\n- \u25a0 maintain an active market in the Company's shares pursuant to a  liquidity contract  in  accordance  with  the  market  practice recognized by the French financial market authority.\n\nThe buy-back by the  Company  of  its own  shares shall  be  also intended to enable the implementation of any market practice permitted by the French financial market authority and, more generally, the achievement of any other transaction which would comply with  the  regulations  in  force.  In this  case,  the  Company would inform its Shareholders by means of a press release.\n\nThe General Meeting sets the maximum purchase price at 250 euros (excluding acquisition costs) per share with a par value of 5.50  euros  and the  maximum  number  of  shares  that can  be bought back at 10% of the total number of shares comprising the share capital at December 31, 2022, i.e. 52,345,027 shares with a par value of 5.50 euros, for a maximum total amount of 13,086,256,750 euros, subject to the legal limits.\n\nThese shares may be purchased at any time, excluding the periods for takeover bids on the Company's share capital, on one or more occasions and by all available means, either on or off a stock exchange, over-the-counter, including the purchase of blocks of shares, or through the use of derivative financial instruments, and, if applicable, by all third parties acting on behalf of the Company, under the conditions stipulated in the provisions of the final paragraph of article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nShares bought back may be commuted, assigned or transferred in any manner on or off a stock exchange or over-the-counter, including the sale of blocks of shares,  in accordance with the applicable regulations.\n\nAs own shares do not confer entitlement to a dividend, the amount of the unpaid dividends will be allocated to retained earnings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It shall be valid as of the date  of  the  Board of Directors'  meeting  called  to  decide on the implementation of the share buyback program and, at the latest, as of November 4, 2023. With effect from this date, it supersedes the authorization granted by the fourth resolution of the Ordinary General Meeting of May 4, 2022, with respect to the non-utilized portion of such authorization.\n\nThe General Meeting gives full powers to the Board of Directors, with the  possibility  of  sub-delegating  such  powers,  to  implement\n\n## Resolutions 5 to 9 Appointment of four Directors; Ratification of the temporary appointment of one Director\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Board of Directors currently comprises twelve members: nine members appointed by the General Meeting and one member coopted by the Board on February 15, 2023, including four foreign nationals and five women (i.e. 50%), and two Directors representing the employees. The percentage of independent Directors is 80%.\n\nThe terms of office of Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones and Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger expire at the end of this Meeting.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, the Board took note of the wishes of Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones and Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger not to be candidates for the renewal of their respective terms of office. Ms Si\u00e2n Herbert-Jones was warmly thanked for her contribution, during her 12 years in office, to the work of the Board of Directors and for her very active involvement in the Audit and Accounts Committee, of which she was a member since 2013 and chaired since May 2015. Ms Genevi\u00e8ve Berger was warmly thanked for her contribution to the work of the Board of Directors since 2015, as well as her participation in the Environment and Society Committee, of which she was a member since its creation in 2017.\n\nYour Board of Directors also decided, on the recommendation of the Appointments and Governance Committee, in accordance with the selection procedure  conducted  by  the  latter,  to propose the  appointment  of four new Directors. These  proposals  are  in  line  with  the Board's diversity policy, aimed in particular at reflecting the Group's international character and its diversity of cultures and nationalities, and having a range of complementary skills  and  expertise,  both  sectoral and cross-functional  (particularly financial and CSR). Thus, under the terms of the 5 th , 6 th , 7 th and 8 th resolutions , it is proposed that you appoint as Directors, for terms of four years, Ms Catherine Guillouard, Ms Christina Law, Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat and Mr Michael H. Thaman :\n\nMs Catherine Guillouard, former Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of RATP until September 2022 and previously Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive  Officer of Rexel, Chief  Financial  Officer of Eutelsat and Air  France,  will bring to the  Board her extensive financial skills as well as her experience as an executive in a major public transport group, where she led the transformation and decarbonization plan.\n\nMs Christina Law, a Chinese national (Hong Kong) and based in Singapore, will bring to the Board her in-depth knowledge of Asian markets, and her managerial experience in large international groups specializing in the fields of healthcare and treatment.\n\nPresident of the Consumer Products Division of the L'Or\u00e9al group, the group's main division, Mr Alexis Perakis-Valat will bring to the Board his knowledge of consumer product markets and his managerial experience within a leading international group, where he has been one of the driving forces behind major transformations carried out in recent years.\n\nAn  American  national, Mr Michael  H. Thaman  has extensive knowledge of  North  American industrial markets  as well as a strong international profile. He brings nearly 30 years of experience, including 13 years as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and 18 years as Executive Chairman of Owens Corning, a world leader in construction materials and one of the highest-rated American groups on environmental and societal criteria, and his experience as a Director in other major global listed US groups, particularly in the field of renewable energies.\n\nIn addition, your Board took note of the resignation, on January 3, 2023, of Ms Anette Bronder, Director since May 2020, due to her wish to take an executive position with an audit firm, which is incompatible with the maintenance of her office as a Director of L'Air Liquide S.A. The Appointments and Governance Committee conducted a selection process with the support of an external firm. At the end of this process, the Board of February 15, 2023, on the recommendation of the Committee, appointed, by way of co-option (within the meaning of  Article 225-24 of  the French Commercial  Code)  for  the remaining term of office  of Ms Anette Bronder, i.e.  until  the end of the 2024 General Meeting, Ms Monica de Virgiliis (1) as a Director of the Company. An Italian and French national, Ms Monica de Virgiliis will bring to the Board her experience of more than 15 years in the Electronics business, her skills in the field of technology and energy, and her commitment to energy transition. Under the terms of the 9 th resolution , you are asked to ratify this co-option.\n\nThe  Board considers that  the members proposed to the  vote  are  independent and  have the  required  availability. At the  end of this General Meeting, subject to  approval by the General Meeting of all the resolutions, the  Board  of Directors  would  therefore  comprise fourteen members: twelve members appointed by the General Meeting, most of whom are independent (i.e. 83% independent Directors), including five women (i.e. 42%), five foreign nationals and two Directors representing the employees.\n\nthis authorization, place orders for trades, enter into all agreements, perform all formalities and make all declarations with regard to all authorities and, generally, do all that is necessary for the execution of any of the Board's decisions made in connection with this authorization.\n\nThe Board of Directors shall inform the General Meeting of any transactions performed in light of this authorization in accordance with applicable regulations.",

It may also be increased by exercising the rights attached to  marketable securities granting access to share capital, under the conditions stipulated by law.\n\nIn  accordance  with prevailing legal provisions,  unless  otherwise decided by the General Meeting, the shareholders have, in proportion to the amount of shares they own, a preferential subscription right to the shares issued in cash in order to increase share capital.\n\nThe share capital may also be reduced under the conditions stipulated  by  law, in  particular,  by  reducing  the  par  value  of  the shares, or by reimbursing or redeeming shares on the stock exchange and by canceling shares, or by exchanging existing shares for new shares, in an equivalent or lesser number, with or without the same par value, and with or without a cash balance to be paid or received. The General Meeting may always compel the shareholders to sell or purchase existing shares to permit the exchange of existing shares  for  new shares, with or without  a cash balance to be paid or received, even if such reduction is not a result of losses.\n\n## Article 6: Shares\n\nIf  the  new  shares  are not  fully  paid  up  upon  issuance, calls for payment shall be performed, on dates set by the Board of Directors, by means of announcements posted one month in advance in one of the Paris official legal publications chosen for the legal publication of the Company's deeds.\n\nShares not fully paid up shall be held as registered shares until they are fully paid up.\n\nEach payment on any subscribed shares will be registered in an account opened in the name of the subscriber.\n\nAll late payments shall automatically bear interest, for the benefit of the Company, as of the due date, without any formal notice or legal action, at  the legal interest rate, subject to any personal action that the Company may take against any defaulting shareholder and the compulsory execution measures provided by law.\n\n## Article 7: Type of shares\n\nPaid-up shares are registered as registered shares or bearer shares depending on the choice of the shareholder.\n\nThe provisions of the aforementioned paragraph also apply to other securities of any nature issued by the Company.\n\n## Article 8: Rights and obligations governing shares\n\nShareholders shall not be liable above the amount of their subscription.\n\nShare ownership automatically binds shareholders to the articles of association and the decisions of the General Meetings.\n\nSubject to legal and regulatory restrictions, voting rights attached to the shares are proportionate to the capital quota they represent and each share confers the right to one vote. In accordance with the option provided for in article L. 22-10-46 of the French Commercial Code,  double  voting rights  will not  be conferred  to paid-up shares and for which a nominative registration for at least two years in the name of the same shareholder can be proved.\n\nAny share grants entitlement, during the Company's term, as in the event of liquidation, to the payment of an identical net amount for any distribution or redemption.\n\nShares are  freely  transferable under  the conditions  provided by law.\n\n## Article 9: Identification of shareholders\n\nThe Company may avail itself at any time of the legal and statutory provisions in force permitting the identification of the owners of shares conferring immediately or in the future the right to vote in General Meetings, as well as the number of shares they own.\n\nIn addition to the legal obligations to notify  the Company, any person, acting alone or jointly, coming in direct or indirect possession of a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights equal  to or greater  than  2%, or  a multiple  of 2% of  capital or voting rights (including above the 5% threshold),  is required  to inform the Company within fifteen days as of the date on which the threshold is exceeded and, as the case may be, independently of the  effective  transfer  date  of  share  ownership. The person shall state the number of shares and marketable securities granting entitlement to capital that he or she owns on the date of notification. Any decrease below the 2% threshold or a multiple  of 2% of capital  or voting  rights  shall be  notified  in  the same manner.\n\nTo determine share capital and voting rights thresholds, the crossing of which must be declared under the previous paragraph, assimilation rules set out in article L. 233-9 of the French Commercial Code are applied.\n\nIn the event of a failure to meet this additional notification obligation, one or several shareholders, owning a fraction of the Company's capital or voting rights amounting to at least 2%, may, at a General Meeting, request that the shares exceeding the fraction which should have been reported, be stripped of their voting rights for any General Meeting held until the end of a twoyear period following the date on which the notice is rectified. The request is recorded in the Minutes of the General Meeting.\n\n## Article 10: Co-ownership and usufruct\n\nAs all shares are indivisible from the point of view of the Company, all joint owners of shares are required to be represented vis-\u00e0-vis  the Company  by  a  single owner selected from among them or proxy under the conditions provided by law.",

As  an  exception  to  this rule, the members of the first Board of Directors who exercised functions as members of the Supervisory Board in the Company under its former mode of administration shall be appointed for a period equal to the remaining term of their mandate as members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors may be re-elected.\n\nEach Director must own at least 500 registered shares in the Company during the term of his functions. If, on the date of his appointment, a Director  does not  own the required number of shares or if, during his term, he ceases to own them, he is deemed to have resigned with immediate effect if he has not rectified the situation within the time limit stipulated in the regulations in force.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy of one or more seats due to death or resignation, the Board of Directors may, between two General Meetings, make temporary appointments. Provisional appointments made by the Board of Directors are subject to the approval of the next Ordinary General Meeting. If the number of Directors falls below the legal minimum, the remaining Directors must immediately convene an Ordinary General Meeting in order to make up the numbers of the Board.\n\nNo individual over the age of 70 shall be appointed as a member of the Board of Directors if his appointment increases the number of the members of the Board of Directors who have passed this age to over one third. If during their term, the number of the members of the Board of Directors who have passed 70 years of age exceeds one third of the Board's members, the oldest member of the Board of Directors who has not carried out management functions in the Company is deemed to have resigned at the end of the Annual General Meeting held following the occurrence of this event.\n\nDuring the  Company's term, Directors are appointed and their mandates renewed under the conditions provided by law.\n\nThey may be dismissed by the Ordinary General Meeting at any time.\n\n## Director(s) representing employees\n\nIn accordance with statutory requirements, if the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is less than or equal to eight, the Group Committee in France shall proceed to appoint a Director representing employees.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, is more than eight, and provided this criterion is still fulfilled on the date of the appointment, a second Director representing employees shall be appointed by the European Works Council.\n\nIf the number of members of the Board of Directors, calculated in accordance with article L. 225-27-1-II of the French Commercial Code, was originally more than eight members but becomes less than  or  equal to  eight members,  the Director appointed by the European Works  Council  shall remain  in office until  his  term  of office expires.\n\nAs an exception to the foregoing, the Director representing employees appointed by virtue of this clause is not required to hold at least 500 registered shares during his term of office.\n\nThe Director representing employees shall be appointed for a four-year term expiring at the close of the General Meeting called to approve the Financial Statements for the  previous year and which is held in the year in which his term of office expires. The tenure of the Director representing employees may be renewed.\n\nThe tenure of the Director representing employees shall be terminated in accordance with statutory requirements and the provisions contained  in this clause,  particularly in the event of termination of said Director's employment contract; if the criteria for the application of article L. 225-27-1 of the Commercial Code are no longer met, the tenure of the Director(s) representing employees  shall expire at  the end of  the meeting during which the Board of Directors observes that the Company has been released from this obligation.\n\nIn the event that the seat of a Director representing employees is vacant for any reason whatsoever, the vacant seat shall be filled under  the  conditions  set  forth  in article  L.  225-34  of  the  French Commercial Code.\n\nIn addition to the  provisions  of  the second paragraph of article L. 225-29 of the French Commercial Code, it is stipulated, if need be, that any failure to appoint a Director representing employees by  the  body  designated  herein, in  accordance  with  the law and with this clause, shall not invalidate the resolutions of the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It determines his remuneration and sets his  term of office which may not exceed his term of office as Director. The Chairman may be re-elected.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors performs the duties entrusted to him by law. He chairs the Board of Directors, organizes and manages its work and reports on such work to the General Meeting. He ensures that the Company's bodies operate properly and, in particular, that the Directors are able to fulfill their assignments.\n\nThe Board may  also appoint from among its  members one or more Vice  Chairmen,  whose  term  of office shall  be determined within the limit of their term as Director and whose role it is, subject to the legal provisions applicable in the event of the temporary impediment or death of the Chairman, to convene and chair Board  meetings or  chair General  Meetings in  accordance with these articles of association when the Chairman is impeded.\n\nNo Director who does not also assume the role of Chief Executive Officer may be appointed as Chairman of the Board of Directors after the age of 70 (or 72 if the Board decides at its discretion to derogate from this  limit in  exceptional  circumstances).  If,  during the term of office, this age limit is reached, the Chairman's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit.\n\nIf the Chairman of the Board of Directors also assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer, the applicable age limit is that applicable to the Chief Executive Officer (other than in exceptional circumstances, if the Board decides at its discretion to apply, on a temporary basis, the age limit for the Chairman referred to in the preceding paragraph).\n\nThe Chairman and each Vice Chairman may be dismissed by the Board of Directors at any time. They may also be re-elected.\n\nThe Board may appoint a secretary who need not be a shareholder or one of its members.\n\n## Article 13: General Management\n\n## Management organization\n\nIn accordance with the law, the Company's General Management is assumed either by the Chairman of the Board of Directors or by any other physical person, Director or not, appointed by the Board of Directors and who assumes the role of Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe choice between either of the two General Management organizations described above is made by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors makes its decision relating to the choice of General Management organization under the quorum and majority conditions stipulated in article 14 of these articles of association. The shareholders and third  parties  are  informed  of  the  Board  of Directors' decision under the conditions stipulated by the regulations in force.\n\nWhen the Company's  General Management is assumed  by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors must appoint, among its  members  considered  as independent  by  the Board of Directors, a Lead Director. The conditions of appointment, the tasks and powers of the Lead Director (in particular, if applicable, the power to ask to convene a meeting of the Board of Directors), are set out in the Board  of Directors' internal regulations.\n\nThe choice made by the Board of Directors remains valid until it decides otherwise.\n\nThe Board of Directors will review, as necessary, the choice made each time the mandate of the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Officer comes up for renewal.\n\n## Chief Executive Officer\n\nIf the Company's Chief Executive Officer is assumed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the following provisions relating to the Chief Executive Officer are applicable (apart from the situation referred to in article 12 paragraph 5).\n\nThe Board of Directors sets the term of office and determines the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nNo individual over the age limit set by law may be appointed as Chief Executive Officer. If, during the term of office, this age limit is reached, the Chief Executive Officer's mandate shall terminate at the close of the General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year during which he has reached the age limit set by law.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. The discharge of a Chief  Executive Officer who does not assume the role of Chairman may give rise to damages if decided without reasonable cause.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer may always be re-elected.\n\n## Powers of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company within the limit of  the  Company's corporate purpose, the articles of association, and  subject  to  the  powers  expressly  granted  by  law  to  General Meetings and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for defining the decisions of the Chief Executive Officer that  require its prior approval.  The Board of Directors' prior approval should be sought particularly for external acquisitions or sales of interests or assets, and for investment commitments, in each case under the conditions and exceeding the amounts corresponding to an efficient operation of the Company as set by the Board of Directors. It should also be sought for financing operations of any amount likely to substantially  alter  the  Company's  financial structure  and  for  any decision likely to substantially alter the Company's strategic orientations determined by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Senior Executive Vice-Presidents\n\nOn the Chief Executive Officer's proposal, whether he be Chairman of the Board of Directors or any other person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more physical persons as Senior Executive Vice-Presidents to assist the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe maximum number of Senior Executive Vice Presidents is set at three.\n\nIn accordance with the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors determines the scope and term of the powers granted to the Senior Executive Vice Presidents and sets their remuneration.\n\nThe Senior Executive Vice Presidents have the same powers as the Chief Executive Officer vis-\u00e0-vis third parties.\n\nIn  the  event  of  impediment of the Chief Executive Officer or the cessation of his  functions,  the Senior Executive Vice  Presidents shall maintain, unless decided otherwise by the Board of Directors, their functions and powers until a new Chief Executive Officer is appointed.",

The Board determines the composition and powers of the Committees which conduct their activities under its responsibility.\n\nIssues related to the performance, remuneration and, where appropriate, the renewal of the term of office of the Chairman and Chief  Executive Officer, or  the Chief Executive  Officer,  shall  be decided by the Board of Directors as and when required, and at least once a year, after analysis by the Committee(s) of the Board of Directors that deal with appointment and remuneration issues.\n\n## Article 16: Remuneration\n\nThe  Ordinary General  Meeting  may allocate  to  the  members  of the Board of Directors, as remuneration for their activity, a fixed annual amount.  The  Board of  Directors is  free  to distribute the overall sum thus allocated among its members. It may also allocate  a  greater  amount  to the  Directors  who  are  members  of Committees set  up within the Board  than  that  allocated  to the other Directors.\n\nThe Board may allocate exceptional sums to remunerate assignments or mandates entrusted to the members of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It may also authorize the submission to the Company of the proxy or absentee ballot forms by teletransmission (including electronically)  in  accordance  with  prevailing  regulatory  and  legal provisions.\n\nThe electronic signature can, when used, take the form of a process that satisfies the conditions defined in the second paragraph of article 1367 of the French Civil Code.\n\nThe General Meeting, duly constituted, represents all of the shareholders.\n\nOrdinary and Extraordinary General Meetings, and where necessary, Special General Meetings are convened, meet and deliberate under the conditions provided by law and these articles of association.\n\nMeetings take place at the Head Office or at any other place designated by the author of the notice, even outside of the Head Office or the Head Office's department.\n\n## Section VI\n\n## INVENTORY - RESERVES - DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS\n\n## Article 20: Fiscal year\n\nThe fiscal year begins on January 1 and ends on December 31.\n\n## Article 21: Inventory, distribution of profits\n\nThe Company's net proceeds, established in the annual inventory, after deducting overheads and other costs, including all amortization, depreciation and provisions, constitute the net profits.\n\nFrom these profits, less, as the case may be, previous losses, a deduction of at least 5% is first of all made to create the reserve required by law. This deduction ceases to be mandatory when the reserve amounts to 10% of the share capital. It is resumed if this reserve is ever used.\n\nThe distributable  profits  are  made  up of  the annual net  profits, less previous losses, as well as the sums to be placed on reserve pursuant to law, plus the profit carried forward.\n\nFrom these profits, a deduction is made of the amount necessary to pay the shareholders, as a first dividend, 5% of the sums paidup on their shares, and not amortized, and 5% of the sums from premiums on shares issued  in cash, and  appearing  in  a 'share premium'  account, without it being possible, if the  profits of a given year do  not permit  this  payment, for the  shareholders  to claim such amounts from the profits of subsequent years.\n\nThe General Meeting may decide to earmark any portion of the available surplus of said profits it wishes for the creation of general or special providence or reserve funds, under any name whatsoever or even simply as an amount carried forward.\n\nThe balance constitutes a surplus fund which is intended for the distribution of the second dividend as well as the amount provisionally assessed as necessary to pay a 10% increase to the registered shares satisfying the following conditions.\n\nGeneral Meetings are  chaired by  the  Chairman of the  Board  of Directors or, in his absence, by the Vice Chairman or the oldest Vice Chairman of the Board, if one or more Vice Chairmen have been appointed, or otherwise by a Director specifically appointed for this purpose by the Board.\n\nIn the event of impediment of the Vice Chairman or Vice Chairmen when Vice Chairmen have been appointed or if the Board has not appointed a Director, the shareholders shall themselves appoint the Chairman.\n\nThe two members of the General Meeting with the highest number of votes and having  accepted  the  position act  as  ballot inspectors for  the General Meeting.  The  officers of the  Meeting appoint a secretary who need not be a shareholder.\n\nIn the event that the Meeting is convened by a Statutory Auditor or by a judicial representative, the General Meeting is chaired by the author of the notice.\n\nUpon the decision of the Board of Directors published in the Notice  of  Meeting  or notice  of  convocation  to  rely  on  means  of telecommunication, the shareholders who take part in the General Meeting by videoconference or using telecommunications means permitting their identification in accordance with the conditions provided by prevailing law, shall be considered as present for calculating the quorum and voting majority.\n\n## Article 19: Powers of Shareholders' Meetings\n\nOrdinary and Extraordinary General Meetings, and where necessary, Special General Meetings allow shareholders to exercise the powers defined by law and these articles of association.",

They appoint and determine the powers of one or more liquidators.\n\nThe liquidators may, pursuant to a decision of the shareholders, transfer to another company or sell to a company or to any other entity or person, all or part of the assets, rights and obligations of the dissolved Company.\n\n## Section VIII\n\n## DISPUTES\n\n## Article 23: Disputes\n\nAll disputes which may arise during the Company's term or liquidation, either between the shareholders and the Company or among the shareholders themselves, regarding Company affairs, are settled in accordance with law and submitted to the jurisdiction of the competent Paris courts.\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\n## General information\n\nThe new shares created in this manner will be comparable in all respects to the  existing  shares  from  which  they  are  issued, for calculating the entitlement to the higher dividends and the higher attributions.\n\nThe increases defined in each of the two preceding paragraphs may be modified or eliminated by simple decision during the Extraordinary General Meeting, according to the procedures it determines.\n\nPursuant to law, the number of shares eligible for these increases shall not for any given shareholder exceed 0.5% of the Company's share capital.\n\nThe General Meeting held to approve the Financial Statements for the year shall have the possibility of granting to each shareholder, for  all  or  part  of  the  dividend or  interim dividends,  an  option for payment  of the dividend or interim dividends in either  cash or shares.\n\nThe duly constituted General Meeting retains the same prerogatives during the liquidation as during the Company's term. In particular, it has the power to approve the accounts of the liquidation and to grant a discharge thereof.\n\nAfter the Company's commitments have been settled, the net proceeds  from  the liquidation are  used  first  to  fully redeem the shares, and the surplus is then distributed equally among them.\n\nFor this purpose, in the event of disputes, all shareholders shall elect domicile in Paris, and all summonses and notices are duly served at this domicile.\n\nFailing  election  of  domicile, summonses and notices  are  validly served at the Office of Public Prosecution of the French Republic at the Paris judicial court.\n\n<!-- image -->",
