We are acutely aware that these challenges are global, vast and complex, and we remain conscious of their ongoing impact.\n\n## 2022 in review\n\nProviding support in a challenging year\n\nAs a global insurer, we understand how devastating natural disasters are for our customers and the communities in which we operate\n\nOur purpose of enabling a more resilient future remains acutely relevant and meaningful\n\nAround the world, our changing climate has brought significant challenges for people and their way of life. As an insurer, we witness first-hand the impact of these events, working alongside our customers to help restore their lives following devastating catastrophes.\n\nFlooding in the eastern states of Australia through early 2022 was one of the largest Australian catastrophes on record, while Hurricane Ian in North America was the second largest on record. Reflecting on the devastation faced by many communities, our purpose of enabling a more resilient future remains acutely relevant and meaningful.\n\nWe are living in extraordinary times. After the global pandemic, we are faced with heightened geopolitical tensions, global inflationary pressures, significant market volatility and supply chain challenges.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine remains deeply saddening and we hope for a speedy resolution to the crisis facing the Ukrainian people.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, QBE has maintained its focus and its commitment to delivering improved profitability and growth. We are pleased with our statutory net profit after tax of $770 million and the growth across our divisions. Our capital position and balance sheet remain prudently positioned. Reflecting our confidence in the outlook, the Board has declared a final dividend of 30 Australian cents per share, compared to the final dividend of 19 Australian cents per share in 2021.\n\n## Operating sustainably\n\nQBE remains dedicated to sustainably meeting our commitments, today and for the future. We continue to evolve to meet the rapidly changing needs of our people, environment, customers and community. As Andrew Horton outlines in his Group Chief Executive Officer's report, QBE has refreshed its sustainability strategy and this provides clear direction for our ongoing sustainability commitments. We have made pleasing progress against our 2022 Sustainability Scorecard which can be found in the 2022 Sustainability data book on our website.",

        "page_content": "In January 2022, QBE was proud to become the first Australian listed insurer to join the United Nations (UN)-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), a group of leading insurers and reinsurers that have pledged to contribute to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of 2100, through a NZ2050 underwriting portfolio.\n\nQBE is committed to transitioning our insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 2050. This commitment complements our 2020 commitment to become the first Australian-based insurer to join the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA), committing to transition our investment portfolio to net-zero GHG by 2050. We also set a new target to achieve net-zero emissions for our global operations by 2030 and remain focused to reduce our overall energy use and source 100% renewable electricity for our operations by 2025.\n\nIn the past year, we have made pleasing progress through our involvement with the NZIA working groups. QBE has participated in the collaborative working group between the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and NZIA members to develop the first global GHG accounting and reporting standard to measure and disclose insurance-associated emissions for specific commercial classes and private motor. The first NZIA Target-Setting Protocol (Protocol) was published in January 2023 and QBE will publish one or more interim targets in accordance with the Protocol.\n\nWe remain proud of our impact investment initiative, Premiums4Good, which achieved another year of growth. There are now 108 securities invested to help make a positive environmental and social impact and now totals $1.6 billion. We maintain our ambition to reach $2 billion in impact investments by 2025.\n\nThroughout 2022, we continued to use our 2021 Human Rights Policy to guide our approach and commitment to human rights. Our consideration of human rights in our employment, procurement, investment, and underwriting practices is part of how we enable a resilient future.\n\nIn January 2022, we launched our new Inclusion of Diversity Policy. One of the ways we are taking action is to drive diverse leadership representation, and across the Group we have a target of 40% women in leadership by 2025.\n\nOver the last year, we have seen an increase from 35.9% to 38.6%, supported by our ongoing focus on inclusion at every stage of the employee life cycle. Across QBE, we are cognisant of gender diversity, as well as all the ways we differ, including diversity of thought, skills and experience.\n\nThe appointment of Yasmin Allen to our Board in July 2022 supports our commitment to diversity, with our Board now comprising 44% women, already meeting our target of 40% by 2025. Non-Executive Directors John Green and Stephen Fitzgerald made the decision to retire from the QBE Board in May and we are grateful for their many years of service and commitment to QBE.\n\n## Supporting our customers and communities\n\nAround the world, we continue to experience increased catastrophe events. The impact of these events is often overwhelming for families, businesses and communities.\n\nOur teams have continued to respond to these extreme weather events: expanding and scaling up to be there for our customers, paying claims efficiently and working with partners and suppliers to get people and businesses back on their feet as quickly as possible. As an insurer, this is fundamentally why we exist - to deliver for our customers when they need us most.\n\nIn October 2022, we were proud to announce a new three-year global Disaster Relief and Resilience Partnership between QBE, Red Cross and Save the Children. We increased our funding to A$1.5 million for each partner over three years. We have a key emphasis on supporting strategic initiatives focused on climate adaptation and mitigation to support communities to be better prepared and build resilience. Since this unique partnership began in 2019, we have helped over 490,000 people in 19 countries respond to and recover from catastrophic events and supported our partners to deliver their programs and relief efforts through the deployment of US$2.7 million. We look forward to our continued partnership efforts to help make a difference for people and communities in need.\n\nOver the past few years QBE has refined its purpose and operations, building a platform for future success. In establishing this platform, it is important to recognise the vital role that all our people play and to that end I extend my sincere thanks to the people of QBE who live our purpose of enabling a more resilient future and deliver each day for our customers.\n\nAndrew and the Group Executive Committee have set a clear strategy for the organisation, underpinned by a purpose and vision that resonates well with our people. I also thank them for the focus and leadership they have displayed during the year.\n\nEqually, I thank my Board colleagues for their expertise and perspectives which have guided our collective and considered decision making this year.\n\nFinally, thank you to our shareholders for your continued support.\n\nMike Wilkins AO\n\nIndependent Chair\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Our vision to become the most consistent and innovative risk partner provides clear guardrails as we seek to build deep and lasting relationships with our customers.\n\nAs I reflect on my first year at QBE, I am incredibly impressed and proud of our people and how they show up for our customers and the communities we serve.\n\nOur new purpose, vision and strategic priorities launched at the start of 2022 have been embraced by our people, helping to bring us together and become a more consistent organisation. As part of this strategy, we remain focused on our commitment to culture and living our QBE DNA, which is the heartbeat of our organisation and supports everything we do.\n\nEarlier this year, QBE released a new sustainability strategy following extensive consultation and a thorough review of the external landscape. Our refined strategy has clear sustainability objectives that are embodied within our strategic priorities. These are to foster an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy, enable a sustainable and resilient workforce, and partner for growth through innovative, sustainable and impactful solutions.\n\nThe foundational work in 2022 will allow us to move faster over the coming 12 months. I see great opportunity to leverage the expertise across our markets and unlock the value of our global organisation. I look forward to updating you on our progress and achievements over the coming year.\n\n## Business performance\n\nThe operating backdrop has been marked by a number of challenges for the industry, including geopolitical tensions, elevated catastrophe experience and a surge in inflation.\n\nDespite these headwinds, the business is demonstrating improved resilience, achieving a combined operating ratio of 93.7% compared to 95.0% in the prior period. Our return on equity of 10.5% has been impacted by adverse investment mark-to-market impacts, though this should improve meaningfully into 2023 on account of higher interest rates.",

        "page_content": "The rating environment remained supportive, and I am pleased with the growth we have achieved, which importantly has been calibrated to refreshed medium-term portfolio mix and growth targets. We expect recent momentum will continue into 2023.\n\nAchieving an appropriate risk-adjusted return on capital in North America remains a key priority, and the turnaround in profitability this year is encouraging. We are making good progress on our strategy to further optimise and grow the portfolio, to achieve better balance and reduced volatility.\n\nNorth America achieved a combined operating ratio of 98.9%, compared to 102.9% in the prior period. I am pleased with the return to profitability for the division in what was a tough year in many aspects, though we have further work to do to ensure the division trends towards our Group combined operating ratio target range.\n\nWe now have quite a narrow product focus in the division, great people and strong distribution relationships. I am confident in our strategy for the division, and see a clear pathway towards improved and more consistent returns.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nOur new direction will define our priorities for the medium to long term and further integrate our sustainability strategy. It is my commitment to provide transparency on our progress and focus on each of our six strategic priorities, as we look to deliver on our vision of being the most consistent and innovative risk partner. In all this work we are fundamentally guided by our purpose of enabling a more resilient future.\n\nWe have made good progress against our strategic priorities this year. Work commenced on our portfolio optimisation targets and these have been incorporated into 2023 business planning. Going forward, QBE will adopt a five-year portfolio planning model and identify the capabilities required to successfully grow in selected classes.\n\nTo ensure sustainable growth, we completed a comprehensive reassessment of our geographical footprint and lines of business that will support QBE's medium to long-term growth aspirations. We will take a longer-term view, and these growth opportunities have been reflected in business planning across the Group.\n\nWork continues on initiatives for cross-divisional opportunities and establishing stronger links between our growth initiatives, to be more aligned with our broader strategic priorities.\n\nBringing the enterprise together sits at the core of our strategy, and the key objective is to unlock the value of QBE through initiatives that help us better organise and leverage capabilities across our markets. The focus for 2023 is to build on our enterprise focus, improve and simplify how we operate to ensure that we can achieve greater consistency and innovation across our global organisation.\n\nTo support our ambition, we need to thoughtfully modernise our business, with many initiatives already underway. We made good progress with our digitisation efforts across divisions and functions. There is ongoing focus on core platforms and further IT estate simplification, all centred around making QBE an easier partner to deal with, and work for, ensuring we fully leverage our data and global scale.\n\nAgainst our people priority, we have made good progress in key areas of reward and performance, leadership and capability; and workforce planning. We launched our 2022 Annual Performance Incentive plan to enable a clear link between culture and performance, which is driving improved outcomes. We established enterprise leadership capabilities through three new leader forums to evolve the way our leaders learn, connect and help embed our enterprise strategy. We have focused on workforce planning to better understand capabilities, and plan and ensure QBE has the right people in the right roles to deliver on its priorities.\n\nI am pleased with the progress made in 2022 against our stated culture priorities. We have clear objectives through our Culture Blueprint initiatives, including an enterprise recognition program and programs aimed at improving meeting effectiveness. The Blueprint initiatives will continue to be informed by data, employees, and key stakeholders across QBE. We established a new Culture Governance approach to drive priority enterprise initiatives and both the Group Executive Committee and Board remain engaged with our culture work through regular updates on progress.\n\nWe remain focused on delivering our strategic priorities and consistently supporting our customers, partners and communities. I am proud of what we have achieved together in 2022 and I am optimistic about the year ahead.\n\nWe expect the risks associated with inflation, ongoing economic uncertainty and climate change should serve to maintain pricing discipline across the insurance industry. Across property classes in particular, these themes will be compounded by the withdrawal of property reinsurance capacity, which should result in higher reinsurance costs for the industry. We expect gross written premium growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits in 2023, and our Plan combined operating ratio on a AASB 1023 basis is ~93.5%.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to work with my colleagues on the Group Executive Committee and the stability in our leadership team has reflected positively across the organisation. I thank our people for their dedication and support of our customers. I have been humbled this year as I met so many people across our divisions and witnessed their genuine care and pride in our company. I look forward to continuing to work with them to help enable a more resilient future and demonstrate the positive role insurance plays for economies and people. Finally, I wish to thank our shareholders for their support over the year.\n\nAndrew Horton\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Material effort to improve underwriting quality, consistency and capability is now translating into better financial outcomes and deeper relationships with our customers and partners.\n\nSam Harrison Group Chief Underwriting O/fficer\n\nQBE has demonstrated adaptability, discipline and resilience in a dynamic and challenging year. The insurance industry navigated new geopolitical and inflation challenges, alongside a continuation of COVID-19 litigation and extreme weather. Despite challenges, we maintained our focus and pleasing progress was made around performance, portfolio optimisation, and our desire to be a successful sustainable i nsurer. We continue to modernise and improve data capability, which has supported improved financial performance and enhanced relationships with our customers and partners.\n\nQBE achieved a combined operating ratio of 93.7% compared to 95.0% in the prior year, which supported a double digit ROE of 10.5%, QBE's strongest in over a decade following 10.3% achieved in the prior period. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our primary ambition for QBE to achieve a consistent combined operating ratio in the low-to-mid 90s.\n\nRate adequacy continued to improve in 2022, where markets remained disciplined in most lines of business. While inflation was a significant challenge for the business, I am pleased with our preparedness, collaboration and response. We expect higher inflation will remain persistent in the year ahead, which, combined with the impact of higher reinsurance costs and an uncertain economic outlook, suggests a pressing need for further rate increases and discipline across the industry.\n\nOur reinvigorated focus on portfolio optimisation and volatility has driven meaningful cultural change over the year, resulting in continued refinement of our cell review and planning process. We enter 2023 with more deliberate and defined enterprise level portfolio growth and mix targets, with our first formal interim target for our underwriting portfolio to be published in line with the Protocol. Environmental and social considerations continue to play a larger role in our planning and underwriting process, where we see a great opportunity surrounding QBE's role in supporting an orderly and inclusive transition towards net zero.",

Over the past two years, we have progressively embedded higher inflation assumptions across a number of classes of business to reflect a mix of experience, and uncertainty regarding the emergence of inflation.\n\n## Portfolio optimisation: more deliberate planning\n\nThe portfolio optimisation strategy has been pivotal in leveraging the foundational enhancement undertaken over recent years into a more deliberate and focused enterprise planning process\n\nOur global underwriting teams are collaborating more effectively than ever before. This has supported the evolution and success of our portfolio optimisation strategy, where our planning process is now calibrated to more defined and deliberate portfolio mix targets, determined as an enterprise. This cohesion has been particularly important in navigating a more challenging reinsurance marketplace, in which we recalibrated our global property catastrophe strategy and appetite.\n\n## Sustainability: underwriting a successful transition\n\nOur desire is for QBE to be a successful sustainable insurer, and we have made pleasing progress around integrating environmental and social considerations into our underwriting culture\n\nWe are proud to have played an active role in the NZIA, as the industry works towards a consistent approach to measuring insured emissions. With this methodology now finalised, QBE's focus for the year ahead will centre around underwriting emission measurement and target setting. This will be a significant and challenging body of work, though we see great opportunities ahead as we begin working more closely with our customers to ensure a successful transition.\n\n## Future fit: an innovative underwriting culture\n\nWe want to foster an innovative and modern underwriting culture, and continually explore ways to modernise, expand our data capability and assess new product lines and opportunities\n\nIn 2022, we successfully launched our new global property pricing tool, which established an enterprise-consistent approach to risk selection, pricing and terms. We continue to explore opportunities in cyber insurance and have collaborated to take our existing capability and establish a new global product. We remain focused on product innovation, particularly where we can encourage and reward sustainable behaviours, and were proud to launch our new green Lenders' Mortgage Insurance (LMI) product in Australia.\n\nWhile there are increasing signals suggesting inflation may have peaked, the persistency of inflation remains a key risk. We remain focused on maintaining dynamic feedback loops between claims, pricing and underwriting teams, and ensuring exposure and rating remains commensurate with inflation.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nGrowth opportunities in 2023 remain attractive, and we expect to achieve further measured growth across our focus areas. Our approach to volatility has matured over the year, and we continue to improve our tools and data to better integrate volatility analysis into our cell review and planning process.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nTo support our transition plan, we remain focused on the ongoing development of the tools needed to improve our underwriting emission measurement depth and quality. We are optimistic and continue to explore transition opportunities that will arise, both relating to nascent industries and technology, and product innovation.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nQBE has an underwriting platform that continues to attract top talent, and is known in our key markets for being innovative and dynamic. The benefit of material positive operating leverage in recent periods has allowed for the opportunity to invest in further data analytics capability and tools to ensure we can maintain and build on our leading reputation.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our sustainability strategy focuses on the environmental and social challenges most relevant to our business, and delivering on our purpose of enabling a more resilient future.\n\nClimate risks and opportunities and the associated economic, social and environmental implications, remain a priority for our stakeholders. Addressing the impacts of severe weather and supporting the transition to a net-zero economy will require considerable capital investment, innovation, and change. Additionally, we know that climate change can exacerbate socio-economic inequalities and that it will take focus for the transition to a net-zero economy to be inclusive.\n\nQBE supports an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy. We have committed to supporting the objectives of the Paris Agreement by working towards being a net-zero emissions organisation across our operations by 2030 and through our investment and underwriting activities by 2050 with consideration of the latest science.

Our success is reliant on many factors and is intrinsically linked to the progress we all can make collectively, particularly in developed countries with net-zero commitments.\n\nEnsuring that sustainability is a fundamental part of our organisational culture, and partnering to develop innovative solutions to address climate and other sustainability challenges, form the other two focus areas of our sustainability strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The story so far\u2026\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Developed Sustainability Framework\n- \u00b7 Launched Premiums4Good\n- \u00b7 Developed Group Diversity & Inclusion Policy\n- \u00b7 First participated in annual PSI public disclosures\n- \u00b7 Premiums4Good grew to $455 million in first year\n- \u00b7 Signed up to the Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs)\n- \u00b7 Adopted the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n- \u00b7 Achieved carbon neutrality 1 for our business operations and have maintained this since\n- \u00b7 Released our Supplier Sustainability Principles\n- \u00b7 Launched the Global Disaster Relief and Resilience partnerships with Save the Children and Red Cross\n- \u00b7 Joined RE100, committing to 100% renewable electricity across global operations by end of 2025\n- \u00b7 Released our Group Environment Policy\n- \u00b7 Developed our Sustainability Scorecard to drive sustainability commitments\n- \u00b7 Joined Business for Social Impact (B4SI) and implemented social impact measurement framework\n- \u00b7 Net zero 2050 investment commitment in line with UN-convened NZAOA\n- \u00b7 Membership of the UN Global Compact (UNGC)\n- \u00b7 Committed to net-zero emissions across global operations by 2030\n- \u00b7 Developed our Environmental and Social Risk Framework\n- \u00b7 Released our Group Human Rights Policy\n- \u00b7 Celebrated 10 years of the QBE Foundation with new strategy launch\n- \u00b7 Net zero 2050 underwriting commitment in line with UN-convened NZIA\n- \u00b7 Extended our Global Disaster Recovery and Relief Partnerships with Red Cross and Save the Children for a further three years\n- \u00b7 Incorporated sustainability-aligned metrics based on culture, women in leadership and risk in executive variable remuneration scorecard\n- 1 On defined emissions inventory related to our operations, see Data Book.",

For a second year, growth in our Crop business was particularly strong, supported by commodity prices and organic momentum.\n\nThere was a remarkable recalibration of interest rates globally, resulting in higher risk-free rates across all currencies. This resulted in a $1,214 million favourable impact to the statutory underwriting result, which was more than offset by unrealised losses of $1,343 million in our fixed income portfolio.\n\nThe statutory combined operating ratio excluding the impact from risk-free rates deteriorated to 94.2% from 93.7% in the prior year. This largely reflected the adverse impact from the Australian pricing promise review, and the impact\n\nof the transaction to reinsure North America Excess and Surplus (E&S) lines prior accident year liabilities. These items impacted the underwriting result by $60 million and $45 million respectively.\n\nTo support comparability of year-on-year results, we have adjusted for these items. On this basis, the combined operating ratio improved to 93.7% from 95.0% in the prior year, representing underwriting profit of $933 million compared to $695 million in the prior period.\n\nThe total investment loss for the year was $(776) million or (2.7)%, compared with a return of $122 million or 0.4% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of risk-free rates, the investment return was $567 million or 2.0%, compared with $382 million or 1.3% in the prior year.\n\nIn fixed income, the portfolio running yield increased materially over the year, to an exit yield of 4.1%, from 0.7% in the prior year. This supported higher core yield income which was partially offset by adverse credit spread marks. In risk assets, unrealised losses on equities and fixed income were more than offset by favourable returns from infrastructure and unlisted property.\n\n## Group Chief Financial O/fficer's report\n\nIn a challenging backdrop characterised by heightened inflation and catastrophe activity, geopolitical tensions and significant investment market volatility, QBE achieved an improvement in profitability, further growth, and importantly demonstrated greater resilience in its financial performance.\n\nIn May, QBE sold the Westwood Insurance Agency in North America for $374 million. The transaction had an $8 million positive impact in the period, after accounting for $328 million of goodwill which was allocated to Westwood, and $30 million in restructuring expenses.\n\nThis transaction alongside improved profitability and lower insurance and asset risk charges primarily due to higher risk-free rates, supported a meaningful improvement in QBE's capital position. The indicative APRA PCA multiple increased to 1.79x from the pro forma view of 1.75x at 31 December 2021, and is now at the top of our 1.6-1.8x target range.\n\nQBE's effective statutory tax rate was 15.3% compared with 17.1% in the prior year, and reflects the mix of corporate tax rates in the countries where we operate, alongside the recognition of $95 million of previously unrecognised tax losses in the North American tax group.",

The transaction had a material impact on the comparison of net earned premium and key underwriting ratios.\n\nThe loss portfolio transfer reduced net earned premium and net claims expense by $390 million and $327 million respectively, while impacting underwriting expenses by $2 million.\n\nAs a result, the transaction had a $65 million upfront net adverse impact (including a risk-free rate impact of around $20 million) on the underwriting result.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the Group and business commentary following excludes the impact of both items from the 2022 result, along with the previously disclosed CTP reinsurance transaction and COVID-19 impacts in the 2021 result.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

Rate increases moderated in lines that have seen the largest increases during the current cycle, particularly casualty classes.\n\nExcluding premium rate increases and Crop, constant currency growth was 4% compared to 10% in the prior period.\n\n## North America\n\nNorth America delivered 16% growth in gross written premium. Excluding Crop, premium increased by 4%, where premium rate increases of 9.2% were down marginally from 10.7% in prior year.\n\nCrop premium increased by 31% as a result of significantly higher commodity prices coupled with strong organic growth.\n\nPremium rate increases and growth in Crop more than offset a planned reduction in property catastrophe exposed programs business. Excluding premium rate increases and Crop, gross written premium declined 1%.\n\n## International\n\nInternational reported a 14% increase in gross written premium.\n\nPremium rate increases remained supportive at 6.5%, albeit moderated through the year from 10.2% achieved in the prior year. Excluding premium rate increases, constant currency growth was 9%.\n\nPremium growth was broad-based. Within Insurance, premium increased by 12%, with particularly strong contributions from the International Markets and UK segments. Within QBE Re, premium growth of 25% reflected strong growth across all segments and offices.\n\n## Australia Pacific\n\nAustralia Pacific reported a 9% increase in gross written premium. Premium rate increases built over the year to 9.5%, compared with 8.3% in the prior year.\n\nGrowth across many segments, particularly in commercial lines, was partially offset by lower volumes in LMI.\n\n## Reinsurance expense\n\nReinsurance expense increased 34% to $4,350 million from $3,252 million in the prior year. The majority of the increase can be attributed to Crop, where much of the premium growth was ceded to a new external quota share reinsurance contract, and the government reinsurance program.\n\n## Average renewal premium rate increases\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER   |   2022 % |   2021 % |   2020 % |   2019 % |\n|----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| North America                    |      9.2 |     10.7 |     10.2 |      5.7 |\n| International                    |      6.5 |     10.2 |     12.8 |      6   |\n| Australia Pacific                |      9.5 |      8.3 |      5.4 |      7.3 |\n| Group                            |      7.9 |      9.7 |      9.8 |      6.3 |\n\n## Foreign exchange rates\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER   | 2022   | 2022            | 2022           | 2021            | 2021           |\n|----------------------------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|\n|                                  |        | PROFIT OR  LOSS | BALANCE  SHEET | PROFIT OR  LOSS | BALANCE  SHEET |\n| Australian dollar                | A$     | 0.693           | 0.678          | 0.751           | 0.727          |\n| Sterling                         | \u00a3      | 1.232           | 1.203          | 1.375           | 1.353          |\n| Euro                             | \u20ac      | 1.051           | 1.067          | 1.182           | 1.138          |",

This included the impact of Hurricane Ian, and a higher frequency of smaller events.\n\nCrop recorded a combined operating ratio of 95.5% which deteriorated from 92.7% in the prior year, and reflected higher claims primarily as a result of drier conditions across a number of states. This offset lower total acquisition costs on account of improved scale, and new external quota share reinsurance.\n\n## International\n\nInternational reported a combined operating ratio of 92.5% compared with 90.6% in the prior year.\n\nThe result reflected a challenging operating environment underpinned by heightened inflation, costs relating to the Russia/Ukraine conflict and elevated catastrophe costs including Hurricane Ian and the French storms.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio improved by 1.5% to 51.6%, where the benefit of significant rate increases partly offset increased allowances for inflation, and higher claims frequency in certain classes.\n\nAdverse prior year development of $142 million or 2.4% compared with favourable development of $66 million or 1.2% in the prior year. This reflected additional, largely proactive strengthening for inflation across a number of classes, and an adverse COVID-19 business interruption court ruling.\n\n## Australia Pacific\n\nAustralia Pacific reported a combined operating ratio of 90.1%, which improved from 91.4% in the prior year.\n\nThe impact of severe weather was exacerbated by short-tail inflationary challenges, which resulted in deterioration in the catastrophe and ex-cat claims ratios.\n\nThis was more than offset by improved operating leverage from premium growth and efficiency initiatives, alongside favourable prior accident year development.\n\nThe LMI current accident year combined operating ratio improved to 15.4% from 35.4% in the prior year, where delinquency and claim payment trends remain supportive.\n\n|                                   | GROSS WRITTEN  PREMIUM   | GROSS WRITTEN  PREMIUM   | NET EARNED  PREMIUM   | NET EARNED  PREMIUM   | COMBINED  OPERATING RATIO   | COMBINED  OPERATING RATIO   | UNDERWRITING RESULT   | UNDERWRITING RESULT   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER    | 2022 US$M                | 2021 US$M                | 2022 US$M             | 2021 US$M             | 2022 %                      | 2021 %                      | 2022 US$M             | 2021 US$M             |\n| North America                     | 7,274                    | 6,289                    | 4,280                 | 3,965                 | 98.9                        | 102.9                       | 46                    | (118)                 |\n| International                     | 7,546                    | 6,958                    | 5,974                 | 5,545                 | 92.5                        | 90.6                        | 447                   | 522                   |\n| Australia Pacific                 | 5,241                    | 5,215                    | 4,519                 | 4,265                 | 90.1                        | 91.4                        | 446                   | 370                   |\n| Corporate & Other                 | (7)                      | (9)                      | (3)                   | 4                     | -                           | -                           | (6)                   | (79)                  |\n| Group adjusted basis              | 20,054                   | 18,453                   | 14,770                | 13,779                | 93.7                        | 95.0                        | 933                   | 695                   |\n| Risk-free rate impact             | -                        | -                        | -                     | -                     | (8.5)                       | (2.2)                       | 1,214                 | 301                   |\n| Australian pricing promise review | (53)                     | -                        | (53)                  | -                     | 0.4                         | -                           | (60)                  | -                     |\n| E&S reinsurance transaction       | -                        | -                        | (390)                 | -                     | 0.1                         | -                           | (45)                  | -                     |\n| NSW CTP reinsurance transaction   | -                        | -                        | -                     | (365)                 | -                           | (0.2)                       | -                     | 3                     |\n| COVID-19 impact                   | -                        | 4                        | -                     | (6)                   | -                           | (1.1)                       | -                     | 139                   |\n| Group statutory                   | 20,001                   | 18,457                   | 14,327                | 13,408                | 85.7                        | 91.5                        | 2,042                 | 1,138                 |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Consistent with normal practice the calculation of prior year movements excludes positive development relating to Crop insurance that is matched by additional premium cessions under the MPCI scheme ($14 million, 2021 $1 million), and adverse development which is more than offset by related adjustments in the current period underwriting result ($137 million, 2021 $55 million).\n\nThe net risk margin movement reflects the release of the COVID-19 risk margin, offset by new business strain.\n\n## Catastrophe claims\n\nThe net cost of catastrophe claims increased to $1,060 million or 7.2% of net earned premium, from $905 million or 6.6% in the prior period. This exceeded the Group's catastrophe allowance for the year of $962 million.\n\nElevated catastrophe activity continued, with industry insured losses expected to settle around $130 billion in 2022.\n\nCatastrophe costs were underscored by Hurricane Ian, which is expected to be the second-costliest North American hurricane on record. On the east coast of Australia, the February-March floods have been declared the most costly natural disaster in Australian history.\n\nFrench storms in June, South African flooding, plus storms Eunice and Elliot also proved significant events for the year.\n\nCatastrophe costs include an allowance for the Russia/Ukraine conflict, which reflects exposure through political risk, political violence and aviation classes.\n\n## Ex-cat claims\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio increased to 58.2% from 57.4% in the prior year.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio of our Crop business increased due to the impact of adverse weather. Excluding Crop, the Group ex-cat claims ratio increased by 0.2% to 54.6%.\n\nHigher inflation was observed across all regions, though most concentrated in short-tail classes. While higher inflation assumptions were incorporated across the business, rate increases remained at or above inflation in most classes.\n\nIn North America, increased severity observed in certain property segments had an adverse impact.\n\nIn International, claims frequency increased in some portfolios as economic activity returned to more normal levels.\n\nIn Australia Pacific, an above normal frequency of non-catastrophe weather claims impacted many classes.\n\n## Prior accident year claims development\n\nPrior accident year claims development was $141 million adverse or (1.0)% of net earned premium, which reduced from $192 million adverse or (1.4)% in the prior year.\n\nNorth America reported $43 million of adverse development, largely reflecting strengthening in discontinued books.\n\nInternational reported $142 million of adverse development, reflecting higher inflation allowances, and an adverse COVID-19 business interruption court ruling in the UK.\n\nAustralia Pacific reported positive development of $44 million.\n\n## Weighted average risk-free rates\n\n| CURRENCY                         |      | 31 DECEMBER  2022   | 30 JUNE  2022   | 31 DECEMBER  2021   |\n|----------------------------------|------|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|\n| Australian dollar                | %    | 3.69                | 3.16            | 1.12                |\n| US dollar                        | %    | 4.21                | 3.09            | 1.44                |\n| Sterling                         | %    | 3.64                | 2.15            | 0.86                |\n| Euro                             | %    | 2.50                | 1.19            | (0.33)              |\n| Group weighted                   | %    | 3.60                | 2.49            | 0.87                |\n| Estimated risk-free rate benefit | US$M | 1,234               | 804 1           | 301                 |\n\n- 1  Estimated risk-free rate benefit for the six months to 30 June.",

Having regard to QBE's franked AT1 distribution commitments and our tax loss position, the dividend franking percentage is expected to remain around 10% for the foreseeable future.\n\nOur modernisation agenda is primarily focused on improving connectivity and ease of doing business with our customers and partners, supporting the digitisation and efficiency of our core underwriting and claims processes, better leveraging data across our organisation and providing better tools for our employees to meet customer needs.\n\nWe have good alignment around the key target growth opportunities across the organisation. Our investment spend will be targeted towards this pipeline of opportunities across both our core franchises as well as related adjacencies.\n\nTo support the expanded investment slate, we continue to expect a Group expense ratio of around 13% in 2023.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

The result was heavily impacted by unrealised losses associated with the significant increase in bond yields over the year.\n\nAdjusting for the impact of changes in risk-free rates on fixed income securities, the total investment return was $567 million or 2.0% for the year, an increase from 1.3% in the prior year. In fixed income, higher core yield income was partially offset by adverse credit spread marks. In risk assets, unrealised losses on equities and enhanced fixed income were more than offset by favourable returns from infrastructure and unlisted property.\n\n## Fixed income\n\nThe significant recalibration in global interest rates supported meaningful improvement in the fixed income running yield, with the 31 December 2022 exit running yield of 4.1% many multiples higher than 0.7% at 31 December 2021. 833 5,396\n\nOur corporate credit portfolio delivered strong relative performance. Credit quality remained sound with fewer rating downgrades compared to levels seen more broadly across fixed income markets. Short-term money Cash and equivalent\n\n## Risk assets\n\nThe risk asset portfolio delivered a total return of 1.2%. This portfolio has meaningful exposure to asset classes with a positive correlation to inflation, partly in recognition of the corresponding sensitivity of our claims liabilities.\n\nTo this end, our unlisted property and infrastructure assets performed well, delivering a 7.7% return for the year. This helped to offset weaker performance across other risk asset classes including listed equities, high yield, and emerging market debt.\n\n## Funds under management 13,649\n\nThe overall investment book remains conservatively positioned, with around 89% invested in high quality fixed income securities and the remaining 11% invested in risk assets.\n\nWe continued to rebalance the portfolio toward our 15% target risk asset allocation, albeit we did slow the pace of re-risking in recent months to reassess opportunities and relative returns, given significant market volatility. 5,094 47\n\nFunds under management declined by 3% compared to the prior period, however increased by 2% on a constant currency basis after accounting for a $1,514 million foreign exchange headwind. The balance was also impacted by adverse mark-tomarket losses, the pre-funded redemption of a Tier 2 note and the E&S transaction.

The redemption was pre-funded by the September 2021 issuance of GBP400 million of capital qualifying Tier 2.\n\n## Net outstanding claims\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the risk margin was $1,287 million or 8.0% of the net discounted central estimate of outstanding claims, compared with $1,418 million and 8.8% at 31 December 2021.\n\nExcluding foreign exchange and the E&S reinsurance transaction, the risk margin decreased by $34 million.\n\nThe result included significant strain associated with ongoing momentum in new business and exposure growth.\n\nThis was more than offset by the impact of higher risk-free rates, which reduced the net discounted central estimate, and the release of remaining COVID-19 related risk margin of $160 million. This release reflects reduced COVID-19 related uncertainty, particularly regarding residual COVID-19 business interruption risk following favourable court rulings in Australia and the UK.\n\n35 The probability of adequacy (PoA) of net outstanding claims reduced to 90.0%, at the midpoint of the Group's 87.5-92.5% target range.\n\nproperties\n\nEmerging market equity Unlisted property trusts Infrastructure assets Alternatives Investment 62 180 QBE has $900 million of perpetual fixed rate resetting capital notes that are AT1 qualifying under APRA's capital adequacy framework. The notes are classified as equity, pay franked after-tax distributions and do not impact the weighted average number of shares for earnings per share calculations (since the notes are written off in whole or in part if APRA determines QBE is, or would become, non-viable).\n\nThe after-tax distribution on QBE's AT1 capital was $50 million.\n\n## Key balance sheet and capitalisation metrics\n\n| AS AT                           |      |                      | 31 DECEMBER 2022          | 31 DECEMBER 2021   | 31 DECEMBER 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                 |      | BENCHMARK            | STATUTORY                 | STATUTORY          | PRO FORMA  1       |\n| Net discounted central estimate | US$M |                      | 16,141                    | 16,107             | 16,107             |\n| Risk margin                     | US$M |                      | 1,287                     | 1,418              | 1,418              |\n| Net outstanding claims          | US$M |                      | 17,428                    | 17,525             | 17,525             |\n| Net assets                      | US$M |                      | 8,992                     | 8,882              | 8,882              |\n| Less: intangible assets         | US$M |                      | (2,018)                   | (2,449)            | (2,449)            |\n| Net tangible assets             | US$M | Fixed income         | 6,974                     | 6,433              | 6,433              |\n| Add: borrowings                 | US$M | Policyholders' funds | 2,744                     | 3,268              | 2,826              |\n| Total tangible capitalisation   | US$M | Shareholders' funds  | 9,718                     | 9,701              | 9,259              |\n| Probability of adequacy         | %    | Risk assets          | 90.0                      | 91.7               | 91.7               |\n| Risk margin to central estimate | %    |                      | 8.0                       | 8.8                | 8.8                |\n| Debt to total capital           | %    | 15-30                | Policyholders' funds 23.4 | 26.9               | 24.1               |\n| Debt to equity                  | %    | Shareholders' funds  | 30.5                      | 36.8               | 31.8               |\n| t Debt to tangible equity       | %    |                      | 39.3                      | 50.8               | 43.9               |\n| Premium solvency  2             | %    |                      | 47.2                      | 46.7               | 46.7               |\n| QBE's regulatory capital base   | US$M |                      | 10,373                    | 10,389             | 9,947              |\n| APRA's PCA                      | US$M |                      | 5,797                     | 5,732              | 5,699              |\n| PCA multiple                    |      | 1.6-1.8x             | 1.79x                     | 1.81x              | 1.75x              |\n\n- 1  Pro forma adjusting for GBP327 million pre-funded debt repaid in May 2022.\n- 2  The ratio of net tangible assets to management net earned premium.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nAt 31 December 2022, total borrowings were $2,744 million, a reduction of $524 million from $3,268 million at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe decrease in borrowings primarily reflects the redemption of GBP327 million subordinated Tier 2 notes in May 2022.\n\nDebt to total capital was 23.4% at 31 December 2022, a minor decrease from 24.1% 1 at 31 December 2021.\n\nGross interest expense on borrowings for the year was $166 million, down from $177 million in the prior year, due to the redemption of the 6.115% GBP327 million Tier 2 notes in May 2022, which were pre-funded with 2.50% GBP400 million Tier 2 notes in September 2021, representing an interest saving of approximately GBP10 million per annum.\n\nThe average annualised cash cost of borrowings at 31 December 2022 was 6.0%, an increase from 5.4% at 31 December 2021 due the pre-funding of the Tier 2 notes redemption in May. Adjusting for the pre-funding, the average annualised cost of borrowings was 5.8%.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, all but $6 million of the Group's borrowings continued to count towards regulatory capital.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

We enter 2023 with a broader and more diversified earnings base and strong growth momentum across our key markets.\n\n## Outlook focus\n\n## Maximise market opportunity\n\nDrive targeted growth and enhance returns\n\n## Reduce volatility\n\nMitigate volatility through evolving portfolio optimisation framework\n\n## Build greater consistency\n\nIn our operations and /f.shortinancial results\n\n## Sustainability\n\nMake a positive contribution to the economies and communities in which we operate\n\nAlthough the macroeconomic backdrop remains uncertain, we remain confident in our outlook for the year ahead, entering 2023 with strong business momentum, a broader and more diversified earnings base, significant support from earned rate, and a capital position at the top end of our target range.\n\nOur portfolio optimisation strategy remains focused on reducing volatility and improving risk-adjusted returns across our business. The progress in reducing property catastrophe exposure proved critical in navigating a challenging reinsurance renewal. Initiatives focused on reassessing reserve risk helped inform the scope of the reserve transaction announced recently, which will significantly reduce reserve volatility, enhance returns and provide greater capital flexibility to support growth.\n\nThe benefit of expense discipline alongside positive operating leverage has been meaningful in recent periods, and now affords increased capacity to pursue further modernisation and growth of our business. In 2023, we will be executing against a targeted set of growth opportunities, as well as initiatives to develop deeper connectivity and improve the ease of doing business with our customers, digitise our underwriting and claims processes, and provide better tools for our people.\n\nWe are progressing with integrating environmental and social considerations into our business planning and financial reporting processes. Material work is underway to lift capability around underwriting emission measurement, as we work towards setting an emission reduction target. We see great opportunity as we work more closely with our customers to ensure a successful transition, and will continue actively exploring transition opportunities that will arise associated with new industries, products and technologies.\n\nInsurance market conditions remain supportive and we expect rate increases and premium growth to continue through 2023 and support further improvement in the underwriting account. The reset in interest rates is translating into substantially higher investment returns supporting a better balance in our earnings profile, and we remain confident of achieving a stronger, more consistent level of financial performance over the medium term.\n\nInder Singh Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

North America delivered on its organic growth strategy while improving portfolio balance, exiting a cohort of unprofitable programs and successfully executing the divestiture of the Westwood Insurance Agency. Alongside further improvement in underwriting quality, North America delivered a combined operating ratio of 98.9%, which compares to 102.9% in 2021, and represents an encouraging return to underwriting profitability.\n\nGross written premium growth was strong at 16%, supported by ex-rate growth of 12.5%. Pricing remained supportive despite moderating in certain pockets such as management liability and workers' compensation, supporting an average renewal rate increase of 9.2%, compared to 10.7% in the prior year.\n\nNorth America executed on a number of portfolio optimisation initiatives calibrated around a multi-year shift in portfolio risk profile and balance. Technical rate adequacy improved from another year of compound rate increases while property catastrophe risk was reduced, with coastal wind exposure down by over 30%. We deployed a number of reinsurance solutions to manage earnings-at-risk in classes such as property and crop.\n\nThere is good momentum across our modernisation and efficiency initiatives. Foundational investments in policy administration and data architecture are nearing completion, including the migration of a number of key systems. Models were improved by integrating additional third-party data for better pricing and improved risk selection tools, while investments are underway to modernise and digitise underwriter workflows.\n\nNorth America executed a loss portfolio transaction during the first half to facilitate the transfer of $327 million of outstanding claims reserves related to the runoff legacy E&S portfolio, resulting in an adverse pre-tax impact $65 million. All discussion of performance within has been adjusted for the impact of this transaction.\n\n## Underwriting result\n\nEX/hyphen.capE&S\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER      | FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER   | 2022   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross written premium               | US$M                             | 7,274  | 7,274  | 6,289  | 4,775  | 4,361  |\n| Gross earned premium                | US$M                             | 7,213  | 7,213  | 5,838  | 4,551  | 4,375  |\n| Net earned premium                  | US$M                             | 3,890  | 4,280  | 3,965  | 3,351  | 3,692  |\n| Net claims expense                  | US$M                             | 2,669  | 2,996  | 3,046  | 2,917  | 2,929  |\n| Net commission                      | US$M                             | 456    | 456    | 512    | 486    | 536    |\n| Underwriting expenses               | US$M                             | 508    | 506    | 460    | 469    | 488    |\n| Underwriting result                 | US$M                             | 257    | 322    | (53)   | (521)  | (261)  |\n| Net claims ratio                    | %                                | 75.2   | 76.4   | 78.4   | 84.2   | 77.9   |\n| Net commission ratio                | %                                | 11.7   | 10.7   | 12.9   | 14.5   | 14.5   |\n| Expense ratio                       | %                                | 13.1   | 11.8   | 11.6   | 14.0   | 13.2   |\n| Combined operating ratio            | %                                | 100.0  | 98.9   | 102.9  | 112.7  | 105.6  |\n| Statutory combined  operating ratio | %                                | 93.4   | 92.5   | 101.3  | 115.5  | 107.0  |\n| Insurance profit (loss) margin %    |                                  | 4.1    | 5.2    | (0.6)  | (14.6) | (3.7)  |\n\n- 1  Excludes impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims.",

        "page_content": "## Underwriting performance\n\nNorth America reported a combined operating ratio of 98.9%, which improved by 4.0% from 102.9% in the prior year.\n\nThe result reflected a lower level of catastrophe claims, which fell to $251 million and accounted for 5.8% of net earned premium, slightly below allowance and down from 7.7% in the prior period.\n\n## Premium income\n\nGross written premium increased 16% to $7,274 million. This reflected particularly strong growth in Crop, and broader property and casualty business growth of 8.1% driven by continued strong rate increases, new business growth, and improved retention. Overall, growth excluding rate was 12.5% compared to the prior period, or negative 1.1% excluding Crop.\n\nCrop gross written premium rose 30.7% primarily due to heightened commodity prices and organic growth of 14%. QBE continued to grow market share with its leading technology-oriented customer proposition, deeply ingrained agent loyalty and investment in new talent.\n\nCommercial gross written premium growth of 17% was supported by strong premium rate increases across most lines\n\n## Claims expense\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio deteriorated by 3.3% to 70.0%, or 1.5% excluding Crop to 58.6%.\n\nThis reflected increased severity observed in certain property segments, and higher social inflation across a discrete portion of the portfolio. These trends ultimately underscore the importance of our decision to terminate a number of program relationships.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio for Crop deteriorated by 7.6% compared to the prior period, primarily as a result of drier conditions across a number of states.\n\n## Commission and expenses\n\nThe total acquisition cost ratio improved by 2.0% to 22.5%, compared with 24.5% in the prior period. This partly reflected the benefit from efficiency initiatives and ongoing improvement in operating leverage, but also mix benefits associated with strong growth in Crop, which operates on a cost base below the North American average.\n\nThe Crop combined operating ratio deteriorated by 2.8% to 95.5%, primarily relating to drier conditions across a number of states.\n\nHeightened inflation, which alongside higher claims in Crop and elevated severity from terminated programs, saw a 3.3% deterioration in the ex-cat claims ratio to 70.0%.\n\nand organic growth in targeted areas including middle market and workers compensation. We exited a number of programs representing around $400 million of gross written premium which reduced exposure to convective storm and social inflation exposed classes.\n\nSpecialty gross written premium was broadly steady as strong new business growth and rate capture in both accident and health, and professional liability was offset by moderation in management and transaction liability, in response to less supportive market conditions.\n\nNet earned premium increased 8% to $4,280 million, a slower pace than on a gross basis due to growth in heavily reinsured portfolios such as Crop, which had a new quota share in place for 2022.\n\nCatastrophe claims decreased 1.9% to 5.8% of net earned premium from 7.7% in the prior year. Catastrophe claims were driven by Hurricane Ian, and the high frequency of smaller events.\n\nAdverse prior accident year claims development was $43 million, or 1.0% of net earned premium, compared to adverse development of $148 million, or 3.7% in the prior period. This reflected strengthening in older accident years for certain discontinued books of business. Further strengthening was also made to incorporate higher inflation assumptions across several lines.\n\nExcluding Crop, North America's combined commission and expense ratio improved by 1.0% to 32.4%, which has declined meaningfully from historical levels.\n\n## Average renewal premium rate increase\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.2%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.5% from 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross written premium by segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                       |   2022 % |\n|-----------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Crop       |     48.6 |\n| /circle6   Commercial |     26.1 |\n| /circle6   Specialty  |     25.3 |\n\n## Gross written premium by class of business Gross earned premium by class of business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                            |   2022 % |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Agriculture                     |     48.5 |\n| /circle6   Commercial &  domestic property |     20.8 |\n| /circle6   Professional indemnity          |     10   |\n| /circle6   Accident & health               |      7.9 |\n| /circle6   Workers' compensation           |      5.9 |\n| /circle6   Public/product liability        |      4   |\n| /circle6   Marine, energy & aviation       |      1.7 |\n| /circle6   Motor & motor casualty          |      1   |\n| /circle6   Financial & credit              |      0.2 |\n\n## Combined commission and expense ratio\n\n## 22.5%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.0% from 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nNOTE: 'O\n\npie grap\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSpecialty\n\nCommercial\n\nCrop",

New business volumes were particularly strong, with ex-rate growth of 8.8%, underpinned by successful growth initiatives across both insurance and reinsurance segments. Mid-single digit premium rate increases continue to compound on multi-year rating improvement across most classes.\n\nWithin the Insurance division, new business momentum was achieved in the International Markets tracker portfolio, and liability and property lines for our UK segment. In Continental Europe, new branches in both France and the Netherlands helped to build our profile in marine and liability products respectively.\n\nIn the Reinsurance division (QBE Re), organic growth has been achieved across all key markets and offices. Focus has centred around deepening relationships with core clients, improving portfolio quality, and reshaping property catastrophe exposure to better complement the Group's overall global portfolio. Rate increases trended higher through the year, with the Property market hardening meaningfully on the back of concerns around loss experience, inflation, and climate change.\n\nBenefits from the ongoing focus on underwriting quality and portfolio optimisation were present in the resiliency of International's underwriting result. International delivered a combined operating ratio of 92.5% compared with 90.6% in the prior year. The result was adversely impacted by heightened inflationary pressures, an adverse COVID-19 business interruption judgement, costs associated with the Russia/Ukraine conflict and elevated catastrophe experience.\n\nIn an increasingly competitive marketplace for talent, we have been focused on establishing QBE as an employer of choice. Pleasingly, QBE Europe was awarded Employer of the Year from a major industry publication.\n\n## Underwriting result\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER     |      | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross written premium              | US$M | 7,546  | 6,958  | 5,856  | 5,200  |\n| Gross earned premium               | US$M | 6,908  | 6,476  | 5,542  | 5,010  |\n| Net earned premium                 | US$M | 5,974  | 5,545  | 4,812  | 4,339  |\n| Net claims expense                 | US$M | 3,017  | 3,134  | 3,106  | 2,918  |\n| Net commission                     | US$M | 1,045  | 980    | 877    | 752    |\n| Underwriting expenses              | US$M | 678    | 726    | 655    | 652    |\n| Underwriting result                | US$M | 1,234  | 704    | 174    | 17     |\n| Net claims ratio                   | %    | 63.7   | 59.8   | 59.4   | 64.5   |\n| Net commission ratio               | %    | 17.4   | 17.7   | 18.3   | 17.3   |\n| Expense ratio                      | %    | 11.4   | 13.1   | 13.6   | 15.0   |\n| Combined operating ratio           | %    | 92.5   | 90.6   | 91.3   | 96.8   |\n| Statutory combined operating ratio | %    | 79.3   | 87.3   | 96.4   | 99.6   |\n| Insurance profit margin            | %    | 13.7   | 12.9   | 5.5    | 7.9    |\n\n- 1  Excludes impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims.",

International achieved an average renewal premium rate increase of 6.5% compared to 10.2% in the prior year.\n\nThe market became more bifurcated for rating, where moderation was observed in many casualty classes, while property lines remained firm.\n\nWithin Insurance, gross written premium increased by 12%, with most portfolios achieving mid-single digit rate increases.

Ex-rate growth was 2%, or 5% excluding the impact of lower LMI volumes. Growth was broad based across a wide range of classes, though it remains strongest in small and medium sized business customer segments.\n\nThe operating environment proved challenging, with elevated natural peril activity and heightened cost inflation. The La Nina climate pattern produced significant flood and storm events across Eastern and Southern Australia in the first and fourth quarters. The frequency and size of natural peril activity exacerbated economic inflationary trends, as the impact of disrupted supply chains was amplified by increased demand for materials and tradespeople.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Australia Pacific's result demonstrated encouraging resilience, with a combined operating ratio of 90.1%, which improved by 1.3% compared to the prior period.\n\nIn response to claims pressures, premium rates continued to firm, with an average renewal premium rate increase of 9.5% compared to 8.3% in 2021. Pricing momentum built over the course of the year, with fourth quarter average renewal rate increases of 10.4%. Rate increases were most pronounced in short-tail classes due to weather and inflation effects, with several portfolios recording double digit increases alongside favourable adjustment to terms and conditions.\n\nDuring the year, modernisation initiatives focused on further uplifting capability across customer and partner connectivity, claims, underwriting and pricing. Australia Pacific commenced preparations for the introduction of the Northern Australia Reinsurance Pool, while foundational investment was made to support commencement of a medium-term digitisation project focused on commercial customer segments.\n\nAustralia Pacific conducted a review of pricing promises in conjunction with the broader Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) industry review. As announced in July 2022, this gave rise to a charge of $75 million in relation to instances where policy pricing promises were not fully delivered. Work is progressing to remediate impacted customers.\n\n## Underwriting result\n\n| FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER      |      | 2022   | EX/hyphen.cap PRICING  2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------|------|--------|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross written premium               | US$M | 5,188  | 5,241                         | 5,215  | 4,079  | 3,920  |\n| Gross earned premium                | US$M | 4,944  | 4,997                         | 4,731  | 3,985  | 3,885  |\n| Net earned premium                  | US$M | 4,466  | 4,519                         | 4,265  | 3,626  | 3,568  |\n| Net incurred claims                 | US$M | 2,688  | 2,688                         | 2,640  | 2,316  | 2,223  |\n| Net commission                      | US$M | 613    | 613                           | 600    | 534    | 526    |\n| Underwriting expenses               | US$M | 607    | 600                           | 601    | 555    | 519    |\n| Underwriting result                 | US$M | 558    | 618                           | 424    | 221    | 300    |\n| Net claims ratio                    | %    | 64.0   | 63.3                          | 63.2   | 62.8   | 60.7   |\n| Net commission ratio                | %    | 13.7   | 13.5                          | 14.1   | 14.7   | 14.8   |\n| Expense ratio                       | %    | 13.6   | 13.3                          | 14.1   | 15.3   | 14.5   |\n| Combined operating ratio            | %    | 91.3   | 90.1                          | 91.4   | 92.8   | 90.0   |\n| Statutory combined  operating ratio | %    | 87.5   | 86.3                          | 90.1   | 93.9   | 91.6   |\n| Insurance profit margin             | %    | 12.2   | 13.3                          | 10.4   | 6.9    | 13.6   |\n\n- 1  Excludes impact of changes in risk-free rates used to discount net outstanding claims.",

Partly offsetting this were higher catastrophe and weatherrelated claims in Householders and Strata.\n\n## Premium income\n\nGross written premium increased by 9% to $5,241 million, reflecting premium rate increases, sustained strong retention levels and new business, partially offset by lower volumes in LMI.\n\nPremium rate increases improved to 9.5% from 8.3% in the prior period. Increases were broad based, though more pronounced in short-tail portfolios exposed to heightened natural peril activity and increased inflation. Premium retention remained strong at 87%, broadly consistent with the prior period.\n\n## Claims expense\n\nAustralia Pacific's net claims ratio was stable over the year at 63.3%.\n\nThe ex-cat claims ratio of 55.8% increased 1.6% relative to the prior period. The benefit of higher earned premium rates and lower claims handling costs was offset by increased frequency of non-catastrophe weather claims, and heightened inflation in property and motor portfolios.\n\nThe net catastrophe claims ratio of 8.2% increased by 2.5% compared to the prior period. The result was underscored by the significant East Coast flood and storm event in the first quarter, and the multiple flood and storm events impacting South-Eastern Australia in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe size, breadth, frequency and mix of natural peril activity (both catastrophe and non-catastrophe) has compounded inflationary impacts by increasing demand for tradespeople and materials, and supply chain disruption.\n\n## Commission and expenses\n\nThe combined commission and expense ratio improved to 26.8% from 28.2% in the prior period.\n\nThe net commission ratio reduced to 13.5% from 14.1% in the prior period reflecting business mix, commission\n\nThe combined commission and expense ratio improved to 26.8% from 28.2% in the prior period.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, the High Court declined leave to appeal test cases relating to COVID-19 business interruption claims. As a result, uncertainty relating to the range of outcomes has reduced, leading to a release of divisional claims provisions and centrally held risk margin.\n\nClaims are now being processed and paid based on the Federal Court ruling.\n\nCommercial gross written premium grew 14% underpinned by farm, commercial motor, commercial packages and engineering.\n\nNew Zealand & Pacific achieved gross written premium growth of 6% despite exiting the Smartpak facility in April.\n\nExcluding LMI, Consumer achieved gross written premium growth of 12%, primarily reflecting higher rate increases. LMI gross written premium declined 43% to $167 million, driven by reduced housing market activity following strong transaction volumes in the prior year.\n\nShort-tail inflation assumptions were strengthened, to reflect observed trends in average claims cost. In long-tail reserves, assumptions have also been increased for average wage growth and inflation.\n\nNotwithstanding, the result included favourable prior accident year claims development of $44 million, compared with strengthening of $111 million in the prior period. Favourable experience in LMI and CTP more than offset the aforementioned inflation related strengthening, and strain in workers' compensation excess of loss, which was closed during the year.\n\nIn LMI, asset quality continued to improve, with 90-day arrears at 0.52%, down from 0.68% at 31 December 2021 and approximately 40 basis points below pre-COVID-19 levels. As a result, claims experience has been favourable and prior accident year claims liabilities held in relation to COVID-19 were released.\n\nincome associated with the LMI quota share reinsurance.\n\nThe expense ratio improved to 13.3% from 14.1% in the prior period, despite higher investment in modernisation and technology initiatives, and investment in staff to support business growth.\n\n## Average renewal premium rate increase\n\n## 9.5%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.2% from 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gross written premium by segment\n\n|                                         |   2022 % |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Commercial                   |     60.4 |\n| /circle6   Consumer                     |     30.9 |\n| /circle6   New Zealand & Paci/f.shortic |      8.7 |\n\n## Gross written premium by class of business Gross earned premium by class of business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                            |   2022 % |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|\n| /circle6   Commercial &  domestic property |     42.3 |\n| /circle6   Motor & motor casualty          |     22.7 |\n| /circle6   Agriculture                     |      8.4 |\n| /circle6   Public/product liability        |      8   |\n| /circle6   Workers' compensation           |      6.6 |\n| /circle6   Financial & credit              |      5.1 |\n| /circle6   Marine, energy & aviation       |      3   |\n| /circle6   Professional indemnity          |      2.4 |\n| /circle6   Accident & health               |      1.5 |\n\n## Combined commission and expense ratio\n\n## 26.8%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.4% from 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->",

However, given the volatility and rapid evolution of the geopolitical environment, new international challenges arise. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia resulted in a material deterioration in the global security environment and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. QBE is focused on managing the risks and impact to the Group while supporting our customers.\n\nIn addition, QBE continues to be exposed to natural disasters, with the 2022 eastern Australia floods recorded as some of the costliest in the nation's history. As the frequency and severity of these weather events continue to increase, QBE is focused on continuously improving understanding and management of climate-related risks. Catastrophe modelling continues to be updated in order to inform underwriting and reserving decisions.\n\n## Enterprise risk management framework\n\nThe enterprise risk management framework describes QBE's approach to managing risk and is embedded in our Risk Management Strategy which is annually reviewed to assess its effectiveness. To achieve the integration of risk in business planning and supporting our strategic objectives, material risks are identified and assessed, with QBE focused on ensuring there is a globally consistent process for individual risk assessments. Group-wide stress testing is performed to help develop mitigation strategies and actions to achieve our business plans.\n\nAlongside strategic planning, our Capital Management Plan and risk appetite statements ensure a balance between risk and return as we allocate resources for sustainable growth. QBE's risk appetite statements define the\n\nthreshold for our risk appetite, and are subject to periodic updates. Monitoring this enables QBE management to be aware of potential earnings volatility risks within the business plan and take action accordingly.\n\nQBE's Group Risk and Control Self-Assessment Standard sets minimum requirements for identifying, documenting, and assessing key risks that QBE faces in delivering our strategic and business objectives, and assessing the effectiveness of those controls in place to manage those risks. The Incident and Issue Management Standard sets the minimum requirements for managing incidents and issues across QBE. This allows QBE to better manage risk and drive continuous improvement by understanding our risk exposure, identifying the root causes and proactively improving the overall control environment.\n\n## Risk governance\n\nQBE's approach to managing risk is set out in the Risk Management Strategy, which is implemented through a three lines of defence model with oversight from the Board. The first line is business, responsible for identifying and controlling risks within our risk appetite according to our enterprise risk management framework. The second line is the risk and compliance function which establishes relevant risk frameworks and has an independent\n\nrole to support and challenge the first line. The third line is the internal audit function which is the independent review and assurance function. QBE's approach to assurance seeks to integrate assurance-related activities across all three lines of defence to provide assurance that the key risks are being appropriately managed.\n\nDuring 2022, QBE has sought to improve the effectiveness of risk management through a number of initiatives including strengthening the organisation's risk culture, developing an earnings volatility risk approach and simplifying the risk framework and internal governance documentation. Management expects to continue this program of risk management enhancements in 2023.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nQBE recognises the importance of risk culture for supporting risk management and is committed to developing an appropriate level of skills to support a strong risk mindset. The QBE Group Risk Culture Standard outlines our framework through which we assess and manage risk culture.\n\nOur risk culture is a key element of the QBE organisational culture and is strongly intertwined with the QBE DNA. We use a variety of processes and tools to understand and continually evolve our risk culture and risk maturity.",

        "page_content": "## Our top risks\n\n## Geopolitical and economic uncertainty\n\nPolitical instability or conflict resulting in disruption to international trade and economic downturn could result in financial loss to QBE. Heightened risk of conflicts, such as the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the US and China, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to energy concerns and additional disruption to supply chains which were already strained from a global economy emerging from COVID-19. This has contributed to inflation, interest rate increases, heightened risk of recession and volatile foreign exchange rates and stock markets across major developed economies to which QBE's business is exposed, driving potential financial loss.\n\nQBE is focused on understanding the potential impacts of geopolitical and economic uncertainty through scenario analysis and ensuring appropriate action is taken, such as through pricing to manage the impact of future claims costs, setting an appropriate business plan and determining appropriate reserves and capital requirements.\n\n## Inflation\n\nHeightened inflation is a key driver of the current global macro-economic environment. Ongoing global political crises impacting energy and commodities pricing also threaten to exacerbate the fragility of the global supply chain. Central bank interest rates are the primary policy response to manage future inflation; however, the economic risk associated is economic slowdown and recession. There is the possibility that central banks choose not to increase interest rates substantially, leading to heightened inflation becoming embedded within Western economies.\n\nAs such, the rising cost of insurance claims, wage inflation and materials (both cost and availability), increasing litigation and litigation funding as well as broader definitions of covered liabilities, could impact profitability targets. Inflation assumptions, impact on reserves and pricing adequacy form a key part of the analysis within the inflation and recession stress tests and Group business planning process. Our inflation working group brings together cross-functional leaders to consider predicted inflationary trends and propose actions to be taken across all dimensions of QBE's business.\n\n## Climate change\n\nAs an international insurer, reinsurer and investor, there are a range of risks and opportunities associated with climate change that will present over the short, medium and long term. The increased frequency and severity of natural disasters due to climate change, as well as the transition to a net-zero economy, drive risks and opportunities. There is the potential for climate change to have significant impacts on certain perils and regions particularly floods in Europe and Australia, and hurricanes in North America, over the longer term. Regulatory pressures continue to grow, as policy action and stakeholder expectations around disclosure become more ambitious over the shorter term.\n\n- Further details on our approach to manage climate risks and opportunities are on pages 34-43.\n\n## Insurance accumulations\n\nThe influence of climate change, technological advances, increased globalisation and interdependency emphasise the importance of appropriate accumulations management towards large insurance loss events.\n\nTo manage this risk, QBE monitors and manages its insurance accumulations. Sophisticated modelling is used to understand both our current and forecast exposures and is viewed against the Board's risk appetite in relation to extreme loss events. We use multiple methodologies to evaluate the concentration risk from exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes, controlling this exposure with the appropriate purchase of reinsurance. QBE maintains an inventory of catastrophe models that cover global perils and regions to match our global portfolio. Scenario analysis focused on underwriting risk elements is employed to understand the potential impact of unexpected events across multiple classes of business. The breadth and depth of scenarios are reviewed and challenged regularly to reinforce new learnings, reflect best practice and to ensure the suite of catastrophes covered are in line with current events and new risks. Reinsurance and broader portfolio management strategies are integral to ensuring that our insurance accumulations remain at acceptable levels.\n\n## Reserving, large losses and prior year claims development\n\nInflation continues to drive uncertainty around the ability of QBE's current reserves to meet future claims with the risk of adverse prior year claims development. Both price and social inflation contribute to the rising claims costs and must be considered in reserving assumptions.\n\n## Cyber\n\nQBE continues to adapt and optimise its operations and strategy in response to the ever-evolving threat landscape. To support QBE's innovative and fast-paced business, QBE aims to effectively manage cyber risk to ensure cyber resilience. QBE leverages the breadth of knowledge and expertise globally to deliver consistent and effective services that address our existing and emerging risks.\n\nQBE's Cyber Security Strategy is informed by recommendations from internal and external reviews and takes a risk-based approach to the current and emerging threat environment. The strategic initiatives for 2022 to 2024 relate to ongoing improvements in our security posture, resilience, enhancing governance of partners and suppliers, investing in our people's security awareness and obligations, and further enabling security solutions in keeping pace with the threat landscape. In line with implementing these strategic initiatives, QBE is also focusing on assurance over our retention, management and disposal of data and datasets.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

Addressing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change is a priority for QBE and our stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022, climate change was a key consideration in the evolution of our sustainability strategy and is highly relevant to our three areas of focus:\n\n- 1. Foster an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy\n- 2. Enable a sustainable and resilient workforce\n\n## 3. Partner for growth through innovative, sustainable and impactful solutions\n\nWe recognise the importance of addressing climate change and incorporating climate-related risks and opportunities into our strategic priorities, business planning and decision-making to meet our environmental and social commitments and enable a resilient future for our business and our customers.\n\n## QBE Foundation\n\nThis year, QBE announced a three-year extension to its global disaster relief and climate resilience partnership with two of the world's leading humanitarian agencies, Red Cross and Save the Children.\n\nThis partnership enables rapid mobilisation of funds for relief activities during disasters and supports preparedness and climate adaptation initiatives for communities around the world. We work together with communities to build resilience and save lives by improving their capacity to prepare, anticipate, respond and recover from disasters.\n\n## Our strategy seeks to address:\n\n## Building community resilience\n\nLocal communities facing increased risk of natural disasters and emergencies are supported to effectively implement systems and practice\n\n## Underinsurance\n\nResponding to disasters\n\nSupporting customers to prepare for disasters and avoid significant impacts\n\nCommunities across 27 countries are supported to respond to disasters effectively\n\nTo underpin our understanding of climate risks and opportunities, we have continued to undertake physical and transition scenario analysis. Understanding the changing nature of weather-related risks is critical to considering how we can help our customers manage their physical risks and how we price for and manage the accumulation of this risk.\n\nThis year, we have undertaken a global, economy-wide transition scenario analysis which has highlighted the risks and opportunities associated with the pathways to achieving net-zero emissions. While there is more work to be done to deepen our understanding and response to the decarbonisation journey, current data indicates QBE is broadly resilient. There are environmental and social benefits to an orderly transition to 1.5 O C through greater economic stability and lower physical risks of climate change. As a global insurer and reinsurer, we have the ability to support the transition across many industries and regions through the products and partners we work with across our insurance portfolio, investment portfolio and own operations.\n\n- QBE's sustainability commitments in relation to these focus areas for 2023+ are detailed in our 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\nTo date, the partnership has been activated in 19 of the 27 countries in which QBE operates and has reached over 490,000 people through the deployment of $2.7 million in funding and a further $2 million in investments through the Save the Children Impact Investment Fund. Our strategic framework outlines four key pillars: Disaster Preparedness and Risk Reduction, Anticipatory Action and Mitigation, Disaster Response and Disaster Recovery, underpinned by the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, UN Sustainable Development Goals and our organisational policies and frameworks.\n\n## Disaster /financing\n\nBy developing forecast-based funding models, we can minimise impact and reduce human suffering and losses from disasters\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

The evaluation of the impact is supported by our accumulations management process, including regularly updated natural perils models, monitoring of property accumulations across the portfolio to simulate weather-related loss potential, budgeting, price setting, and the use of reinsurance to protect capital and reduce earnings volatility.\n\nOur analysis concludes that the impact of climate change will differ significantly across both regions and the type of catastrophes. From the perils and regions studied so far, flood claims in Europe and Australia potentially could be the most impacted, while cyclones and convective storms in North America and Australia may take a little longer (mid-century) before the impact of climate change becomes more significant.\n\nAs part of our portfolio optimisation, we have reduced our exposure to North American hurricane given its significance in terms of its exposure to physical climate risk and driving potential losses for our business.\n\nWe expect climate change will increasingly impact the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes over the long term. In the short term, it is often difficult to distinguish the impact of climate change versus the normal short-term variability in weather and natural catastrophes. QBE looks to manage for natural catastrophe volatility by considering a wide range of event frequency and severity scenarios in our capital planning. We also purchase a comprehensive Group catastrophe reinsurance program. Our catastrophe allowance in 2023 has been established at well above the long-term average of our modelled catastrophe costs. We effectively planned for the elevated level of catastrophe activity experienced in recent years.\n\n## 2023 catastrophe allowance 'as-if' analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2012",

        "page_content": "## Underwriting\n\nIn January 2022, we announced the commitment to transition our insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to netzero GHG emissions by 2050. We also became the first listed Australian insurer to join the NZIA, a group of leading insurers and reinsurers that have pledged to help accelerate the transition to net zero within insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios.\n\nThis cemented our ongoing commitment to help support the transition of our customers, encouraging businesses to decarbonise and adopt more sustainable business models. NZIA's key objective is to set a common global standard to assess, understand and disclose the emissions intensity for underwriting, and a protocol based on science-based targets. This establishes a foundation and enables the insurance industry to set interim decarbonisation-related targets every five years, with the first interim target being 2030, and begin the process of annual reporting.\n\nOur involvement in the NZIA has enabled participation within the working groups centred around delivering the NZIA's key objectives. QBE has been part of the collaborative working group between PCAF and NZIA to develop the first GHG gas accounting and reporting standard to measure and disclose insurance-associated emissions for specific commercial lines classes of business and private motor, published in November 2022. QBE led the reporting and metrics sub-working group on the methodology work, is a member of the NZIA target-setting protocol working group that commenced in September 2022 and\n\n## Insuring the transition\n\nIn 2022, QBE launched a Sustainable Energy unit to support customers as they transition to lower carbon energy. The unit aligns QBE underwriting capabilities with the growing range of companies and energy systems that form part of a rapidly changing energy mix throughout the world.\n\n## Operations\n\nIn 2022, we continued to deliver on our net-zero roadmap and broaden our focus, extending our 2030 commitment to net zero for our global operations to include material Scope 3 emissions (in addition to Scope 1 and 2 emissions). We have also committed to commencing engagement on net-zero progress with large suppliers in our global supply chain, with the goal of setting targets for those large suppliers by 2025 and developing our approach for 2023 to 2025.\n\n- Further details on our approach to net zero within our operations is available in the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\nwas co-lead for the focus group on setting the overall emissions target for the NZIA Target-Setting Protocol. In January 2023, the NZIA published the Protocol and QBE is expecting to develop and disclose interim targets in line with this Protocol.\n\nThis is uncharted territory for the insurance industry, and we recognise that there is a material gap in emissions data reported, especially by private corporations and small to medium enterprises. Despite these challenges, we expect, with appropriate engagement and changes in government policy, this should improve over time.\n\nWe are also cognisant that the world needs a sustained shift in energy supply away from fossil fuels and towards low carbon. The situation in Ukraine and its impact on energy supply further underlines the need to find alternative, sustainable sources of energy. Our net-zero re/insurance strategies consider the social consequences, aligned to our sustainability focus area of fostering an orderly and inclusive transition to a net-zero economy. We recognise that not all countries or communities can be expected to transition at the same pace. Our internal target setting strategies will seek to look to minimise these disparities and achieve overall emissions reductions in line with our commitment.\n\n- Refer to the 2022 Sustainability Report for more information.\n\n## Helping our customers adapt\n\nAs a business, we continually explore new ways to support our customers on their mitigation and adaptation journeys.\n\nTo encourage green home ownership and increase affordability of green home ownership, this year we launched a new benefit for lenders' mortgage insurance (LMI) customers. Customers who purchase or refinance a home with a green mortgage (through our participating partners) receive a premium reduction for their LMI. 100% of the LMI premiums for green mortgages are contributed to our Premiums4Good initiative.\n\n## ICA climate change roadmap\n\nTo support broader action across the Australian general insurance sector, QBE has, through our role as co-chair of the Insurance Council of Australia's (ICA) Net-Zero Working Group, worked with our peers and the ICA to develop a climate change roadmap for the sector. The roadmap provides guidance for ICA members on the role they can play in the decarbonisation of the Australian economy and is aligned with our broader global commitments, including our commitments through the NZAOA and NZIA.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

As asset owners, we have a unique role at the top of the investment value chain, and we acknowledge both the responsibilities and opportunities that come with this role. In 2022, we have continued to utilise guidance, tools and support of the NZAOA, as well as collaborated with other members, both one on one, and in the relevant NZAOA working groups with which QBE is involved. In 2021, to deliver on our commitment to transition our investment portfolio to net zero by 2050 and set our initial intermediate targets, we established cross functional working groups. In 2022, these working groups continued this work with a key focus on implementation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engagement\n\n## All external managers\n\nacross our investment portfolio\n\n## 20 highest emitters\n\nin our investment grade corporate credit portfolio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancing the transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5% by 2025\n\nof assets under management in climate solutions investments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon intensity reduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 25% by 2025\n\nof our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in our equity portfolio\n\n## Engagement\n\nWe believe that having meaningful dialogue on climate change is a critical component of our responsibility as an asset owner and in ensuring sustainable financial outcomes. We have been engaging with our external managers on climate-related issues since 2019 and each year we evolve the conversation by improving, expanding and tailoring the questions we ask. In 2021, as part of our target setting work, we engaged all our external managers across our investment portfolio and our 20 highest emitters in investment grade corporate credit, providing a baseline for us to monitor progress. In 2022, we have\n\nfurther enhanced our engagement approach by including asset class specific climate due diligence questions. Each year, we will engage with all of our external managers to continue to track progress across key climate-related issues, including net-zero commitments and emissions target setting. For our top 20 highest emitters in our investment grade corporate credit portfolio, we enhanced our engagement approach to be more tailored, identifying material areas of focus per issuer and directing targeted questions to each company allowing for more meaningful and relevant dialogue.\n\n## Financing the transition\n\nWe have set a target to increase our exposure to climate solution investments that will finance the transition. These investments will directly contribute to climate change mitigation and/or adaptation and follows guidance from the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol. In 2022, this has increased to 4.8% from 3% at the end of 2021. Notably, in 2022 we added\n\n$134 million in green bonds. Green bonds fund projects that have positive environmental benefits and support the transition to a net-zero economy. We will continue to actively invest in green bonds as well as search for additional opportunities that support the transition to a net-zero economy including negative emissions investments.\n\n## Carbon intensity reduction\n\nQBE has set the target of 25% reduction in the carbon intensity of our developed market equity portfolio by 2025, relative to a 2019 baseline. Over the course of 2022, we worked towards developing a more resilient portfolio by changing the way we will primarily invest in developed market equity by moving from passive strategies via exchange traded funds to tailored mandates with external equity managers. As part of our due diligence, we considered prospective\n\nmanagers' commitments to net zero and decarbonising the real economy as well as their ability to incorporate our emissions reduction targets into the investment management agreements. We expect to make this transition of our investment approach in 2023. Over the course of 2023 we will continue to progress and expect to set additional asset class emissions reduction targets in line with the NZAOA Target Setting Protocol.\n\n## Data, monitoring and reporting\n\nAs part of our learnings from the work we undertook in 2021, we also introduced a new working group, to deliver our data, monitoring and reporting requirements. The working group is focused on the sourcing and gathering of relevant data as well as implementing system solutions for monitoring and reporting to support decision making and progress tracking to achieve our goals. A key output for the working group this year has been the\n\ndevelopment of tools to provide attribution, monitoring and overall tracking of emissions across the developed market equity portfolio. We are also in the process of implementing a new investment system, which will provide enhanced data capabilities, consistency of reporting and ongoing accuracy to improve the way we incorporate climate-related considerations into our investment process to achieve our commitment to decarbonisation.",

QBE manages climate risk through integration into decision-making and our processes and frameworks.\n\nManaging climate risk is integrated into our assessment of natural perils modelling, our management of exposure accumulations, the design of our reinsurance program and our portfolio optimisation and sustainable growth strategic priorities. Further, managing the risks and opportunities of climate is integrated into the three focus areas of our sustainability strategy.\n\nThe sustained increase in the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes represents a challenge where we provide cover for physical loss or damage to assets. It also increases the potential for third party injury and/or damage. Given this, we have spent considerable time over the past two years analysing what the potential impacts of climate change may be from a physical, liability and transition risk perspective, and we have used this analysis to assess the resilience of our strategic responses, improve our underwriting, pricing and business planning, and to set our risk appetite.\n\nQBE has a Risk Management Strategy to ensure we achieve our strategic priorities while also establishing\n\n## Training\n\nThis year, training modules were developed and rolled out Group-wide on ESG risk and climate change. These are voluntary and available to all employees with the aim of improving the understanding of what are ESG and climate risks, and QBE's approach to identifying and managing these risks.\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk Framework\n\nOur Environmental and Social Risk Framework came into effect on 1 January 2022. Through our positions in the Framework, we have committed to reduce our exposure to higher transition risks in the energy sector. QBE has no direct investments in coal, oil or gas and will no longer directly invest in these sectors. We no longer underwrite new coal and oil sands projects, and only support oil sands and Arctic drilling where the company is on a pathway consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement objectives.\n\neffective governance and fundamental principles for the management of risk across all levels of the organisation. Climate change is part of ESG risk, which is classified as a strategic risk sub-class in our Strategic Risk Policy and Risk Management Strategy. Climate-related risks are also considered across our other risk classes such as insurance, credit, market and operational risk.\n\nOur approach to identifying and managing ESG risks, including climate-related risks, is outlined in our Group ESG Risk Standard. Climate change continued to be our top ESG risk in 2022, alongside modern slavery and human rights, biodiversity, and sustainable procurement.\n\nOne of the ways we can identify and assess ESG risks is through the Group Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) process. QBE's Group RCSA Standard sets minimum requirements for identifying, documenting, and assessing key risks that QBE faces in delivering our strategic and business objectives. The Standard is also used to assess the effectiveness of the controls in place to manage those risks.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The QBE DNA consists of seven interwoven elements that are fundamental to QBE and how QBE needs to operate to succeed, recognising its customers, people, shareholders and communities. QBE believes that a culture that rewards transparency, integrity and performance will promote its long-term sustainability and the ongoing success of its business.\n\n## Board and management\n\n## Board functions\n\nThe Board charter sets out the role and responsibilities of the Board, including matters expressly reserved for the Board and those delegated to its Committees and management. The role of the Board is to represent and serve the interests of shareholders by providing guidance and oversight of QBE's strategies, policies and performance. This includes demonstrating leadership, setting the strategic direction for QBE. The Board also promotes QBE values that underpin the desired culture and monitors the performance of management in the delivery of strategy. The Board's principal objective is to maintain and increase shareholder value while ensuring that the activities of QBE are properly managed.\n\nThe Board reviews strategy on an ongoing basis. To help the Board maintain its understanding of the business and to effectively assess management, directors receive regular presentations from the divisional chief executive officers and other senior managers of the various divisions on relevant topics, including budgets, three-year business plans and operating performance. The Board receives updated forecasts during the year. The non-executive directors also have contact with senior executives in various forums throughout the year.\n\nVisits by non-executive directors to QBE's offices in key locations are encouraged. The Board meets regularly in Australia and, due to QBE's substantial overseas operations spends time in the United Kingdom and the United States each year.\n\nEach formal Board meeting normally considers reports from the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together with other relevant reports. The non-executive directors regularly meet in the absence of management. The Chair and Group Chief Executive Officer in particular, and directors in general, including those on the divisional boards, have substantial contact outside Board and Committee meetings.\n\nDetails of the number of Board meetings held during the 2022 financial year and attendance by directors are set out in the Directors' Report. Directors are expected to attend all Board meetings.\n\n## Senior management functions\n\nManagement's responsibilities are to:\n\n- \u00b7 develop a draft strategy, make recommendations to the Board and implement the Board-approved strategy, subject to market conditions;\n- \u00b7 instil and reinforce QBE's values and desired culture;\n- \u00b7 prepare annual budgets and three-year business plans;\n- \u00b7 carry on day-to-day operations within the Board-approved annual budget and three-year business plans, subject to market conditions;\n- \u00b7 design and maintain internal controls;\n- \u00b7 establish and monitor the effectiveness of the risk and compliance management systems, and monitor and manage all material risks consistent with the strategic objectives, risk appetite statements and policies approved by the Board;\n- \u00b7 provide the Board with accurate, timely and clear information on the Group's operations, including on compliance with material legal and regulatory requirements and any conduct materially inconsistent with the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct;\n- \u00b7 inform the Board of material matters and keep the Board and market fully informed of any matters which a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of QBE's shares; and\n- \u00b7 monitor that succession plans exist for all Group executive positions other than the Group Chief Executive Officer. The succession plans for the Group Chief Executive Officer are managed by the Governance & Nomination Committee, and are discussed in more detail below.\n\nThe Board delegates responsibility to the Group Chief Executive Officer for the day-to-day management of the business.\n\nQBE has operated under an extensive written system of delegated authorities for many years. In particular, a written delegated authority with specified limits is approved by the Board each year to enable the Group Chief Executive Officer to conduct QBE's business in accordance with detailed budgets and business plans. This delegated authority deals with topics such as underwriting, reinsurance protection, claims, investments, acquisitions and expenses. The Group Chief Executive Officer delegates authority to management throughout the Group on a selective basis, taking into account expertise and past performance. Compliance with delegated authorities is monitored by management and adjusted as required based on performance, market conditions and other factors. Management and the Group's internal audit teams review compliance with delegated authorities and a breach can lead to disciplinary procedures, including dismissal.",

        "page_content": "## Chair\n\nThe independent Chair of the Board is Mike Wilkins AO, who was appointed to that role in March 2020. The Chair is responsible for ensuring that the Board functions as an effective and cohesive group. The Chair works closely with the Group Chief Executive Officer to determine the strategic direction for QBE and to establish high standards of governance and leadership.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Board is supported by several Committees which meet regularly to consider audit, risk management, remuneration, and other matters. The main Committees of the Board are the Audit, Governance & Nomination, People & Remuneration and Risk & Capital Committees. Further sub-committees of the Board may be convened to confer on particular issues from time to time. Any non-executive director may attend a Committee meeting.\n\nThe Committees have free and unfettered access to QBE's senior managers and may consult external advisers at QBE's cost with the consent of the Committee Chair. A report on each Committee's last meeting is provided at the next Board meeting.\n\nEach Committee comprises at least three independent directors and each Committee Chair is an independent director who is not the Chair of the Board (excluding the Governance & Nomination Committee, the Chair of which is Mike Wilkins). Each Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. These charters are available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/ corporate-governance/qbe-charters-and-constitution. The membership of each Committee is provided at www.qbe.com/about-qbe/ group-board-of-directors and details of the number of Committee meetings held during the 2022 financial year and attendance by Committee members at Committee meetings is set out in the Directors' Report.\n\n- Further information regarding the Committees can be found throughout this corporate governance statement.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and all of the Committees and is accountable directly to the Board, through the Chair, on all matters to do with the proper functioning of the Board. All directors have direct access to the Company Secretary.\n\nThe Company Secretary's role is described in the Board charter and includes communication with regulatory bodies and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The Company Secretary overseas statutory and other filings and assisting with good information flows within the Board and its Committees and between non-executive directors and senior management, as well as facilitating induction and professional development of directors as required. The Company Secretary may also provide guidance to directors in relation to governance matters.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nDirectors are selected to provide to QBE a broad range of skills, experience and expertise complementary to QBE's insurance activities. The Board comprised nine directors at 31 December 2022, being an independent Chair, seven other independent directors and the Group Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board has a skills matrix covering the range of competencies and experience of each director. When the need for a new director is identified, the required experience and competencies of the new director are considered in the context of this matrix and any gaps that may exist.\n\nThe Board's skills matrix is summarised below:\n\n## SKILLS\n\n## INDUSTRY\n\n| Financial literacy   | Government relations   |\n|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Legal                | Executive leadership   |\n| Governance           | Digital technology     |\n| Strategy             | Cyber security         |\n| Commercial expertise | IT risks               |\n| Risk management      | Data analytics         |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral insurance\n\nFinancial services Accounting\n\nReinsurance\n\nInvestment banking\n\nDetails of individual directors, including their qualifications and experience, independence status and period of Board tenure, are set out in the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report and can also be found on the QBE website at www.qbe.com/about-qbe/group-board-of-directors.\n\n## Independence of the Board\n\nDuring the 2022 year, the majority of the directors on the Board were independent directors, applying the 'independence' definition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council. When applying this definition, the Board has determined that an independent director's relationship with QBE as a professional adviser, consultant, supplier, customer or otherwise is not material unless amounts paid under that relationship exceed 0.1% of QBE's annual revenue. The roles of the Chair and Group Chief Executive Officer are generally also not exercised by the same individual.\n\nDirectors are required to advise the Board on an ongoing basis of any interest they have that they believe could conflict with QBE's interests. If a potential conflict does arise, either the director concerned may choose not to, or the Board may decide that he or she should not, receive documents or take part in Board discussions while the matter is being considered. Conflicts of interest, including related party transactions, are a standing agenda item and are considered by the Board at each Board meeting.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement continued\n\n## Tenure\n\nThe mere fact that a director has served on the Board for a lengthy period of time does not, of itself, suggest a lack of independence; however, the Board has agreed that a non-executive director's term should be approximately 10 years. Under the Company's Constitution, there is no maximum fixed term or retirement age for non-executive directors. The Board considers that a mandatory limit on tenure would deprive the Group of valuable and relevant corporate experience in the complex world of international general insurance and reinsurance. The tenure of each director is set out in the Board of Directors section of the Annual Report and can also be found on the QBE website at www.qbe.com/about-qbe/group-board-of-directors.\n\nThe Constitution provides that no director, except the Group Chief Executive Officer, shall hold office for a continuous period in excess of three years or past the third Annual General Meeting (AGM) following a director's appointment, whichever is the longer, without submission for individual re-election.\n\n## Board and senior executive selection process\n\nThe Board has a Governance & Nomination Committee which meets regularly during the year around the time of the Board meetings. The Committee assists the Board in appointing directors so that the Board as a whole has the necessary range of skills, knowledge and experience to be effective. The Committee also assists the Board in managing the succession plans for the Group Chief Executive Officer and reviewing succession plans for members of the Group Executive Committee (GEC). The Governance & Nomination Committee is comprised of four non-executive directors of the Board and is chaired by Mike Wilkins.\n\nA formal process for the selection and appointment of directors or senior executives is undertaken by the Governance & Nomination Committee and Board. Appropriate background checks are undertaken before the Board appoints a new director or senior executive or puts forward a candidate for election. External consultants may be employed, where necessary, to search for prospective directors. Candidates are assessed against the required skills and on their qualifications, background and personal qualities.\n\nFor Board appointments, candidates must also have the required time to commit to the position. The Board regularly reviews the mix of skills that is required to operate effectively. Under the Constitution, the size of the Board is limited to 12 directors. The Board considers that a maximum of 12 directors reflects the largest realistic size of the Board that is consistent with:\n\n- \u00b7 maintaining the Board's efficiency and cohesion in carrying out its governance duties on behalf of shareholders;\n- \u00b7 reducing the risk of a director being insufficiently involved in, and informed about, the business of QBE; and\n- \u00b7 providing individual directors with greater potential to contribute and participate.\n\nQBE also provides shareholders with all material information in its possession that is relevant to a decision on whether or not to elect or re-elect a director. This is done through a number of channels, such as the notice of meeting, director biographies and other information contained in the Annual Report.\n\nUpon appointment, each non-executive director and senior executive is provided with a written agreement which sets out the terms of their appointment.\n\nThe Board believes that orderly succession and renewal contribute to strong corporate governance and are achieved by careful planning and continual review. As an ongoing evaluation, the Board regularly discusses its composition in relation to the mix of skills, diversity and geographic location of directors to meet the needs of QBE.\n\n## Director induction and training\n\nUpon appointment, directors attend induction sessions where they are briefed on QBE's history, DNA, strategy, financials, and risk management and governance frameworks.\n\nA non-executive director may seek such advice at QBE's cost with the consent of the Chair. Directors are also provided with ongoing professional development and training programs to enable them to develop and maintain their skills and knowledge at QBE's cost, with the consent of the Chair. Non-executive directors are required to complete continuing professional development each year, including on insurance, customer and regulatory matters.",

The Board regularly reviews its performance through internal and external assessments. Recommendations for either improvement or increased focus are agreed and promptly implemented.\n\nA Board performance evaluation was conducted in 2022 for the 2021 year. The review covered the performance of boards and committees at both the Group and divisional levels.\n\n## People & Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Board has a People & Remuneration Committee which meets at least four times each year to assist it in, amongst other things, overseeing major remuneration practices of QBE. The People & Remuneration Committee is comprised of independent directors and is chaired by Tan Le.\n\n## Performance evaluation - senior executives\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee oversees the performance of senior executives. In addition, the Board continually monitors the performance of senior executives through regular review and reporting.\n\nIn 2022, QBE introduced a new Annual Performance Incentive plan, utilising a business scorecard containing Group adjusted cash ROE and Group COR financial measures alongside risk, people and strategic non-financial measures. Individual performance objectives focus on both what has been achieved and how it is achieved during the year. Senior executives' risk performance is also evaluated which may result in upwards or downwards adjustment to their remuneration outcomes.\n\nA senior executives' performance evaluation was conducted by the People & Remuneration Committee for the 2022 year, with reference to their performance against agreed 2022 objectives.\n\nThe Remuneration Report sets out the executive key management personnel (KMP) business scorecard on page 67 which provides a summary of performance against the key measures and a weighted outcome relative to target.\n\n## Remuneration policies and practices\n\nDetails of QBE's policies and practices regarding the remuneration of executives and non-executive directors (being key management personnel) are set out in the Remuneration Report.\n\nOther than meeting statutory superannuation requirements, QBE does not have in place any retirement benefit schemes for non-executive directors.\n\nQBE's Securities Trading Policy outlines QBE's approach to derivatives or otherwise limiting the economic risk of participating in an equity-based remuneration scheme, and is available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Group governance\n\n## Governance frameworks\n\nQBE has a Board-approved Group Governance Framework that sets out five overarching governance principles that support best practice governance across QBE and is designed to encourage collective accountability across Group Head Office and the divisions.\n\nThe framework defines the roles, responsibilities and composition of the Group and divisional boards and committees to facilitate the governance and oversight of the business. The framework also strengthens the relationship and information flows between the Group and divisional boards and committees, so that they can work together to achieve the best possible outcomes for QBE.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement continued\n\n## QBE DNA\n\nEverything we do at QBE is underpinned by our QBE DNA, which consists of seven interwoven elements. These elements describe who we are and what we stand for, and outline the standards and behaviours we expect from our employees to achieve our goals and fulfil our purpose.\n\nAt QBE, when we show up for our customers, shareholders, communities and each other:\n\n- \u00b7 we are customer-focused;\n- \u00b7 we are technical experts;\n- \u00b7 we are inclusive;\n- \u00b7 we are fast-paced;\n- \u00b7 we are courageous;\n- \u00b7 we are accountable; and\n- \u00b7 we are a team.\n\nThe QBE DNA is set and approved by the Board, with the GEC responsible for bringing the elements to life throughout the organisation through our day-to-day interactions as well through our recruitment, onboarding, performance, reward, leadership, feedback, learning and communication practices.\n\nEmployees' demonstration of the QBE DNA is integral to how strategic performance objectives are measured. At the end of the performance year, employees are assessed in terms of both what they have achieved and how they have achieved it - whether their behaviours were aligned to the QBE DNA. This in turn links to reward outcomes and is applicable for all employees, including senior executives.\n\nThe Group Code of Ethics and Conduct addresses the responsibilities employees have to the Group, to each other and to customers, suppliers, communities and governments. It provides clear guidance to help employees apply good judgement and make considered decisions that exemplify the QBE DNA.\n\n## Group policies\n\nQBE maintains a suite of Group policies commensurate with a mature and well-run organisation. QBE policies are governed by a global policy framework designed to establish consistent policy design and management requirements. Group policies serve as vital conduits to facilitate an understanding of the Group's compliance and conduct expectations. QBE's approach in key compliance areas recognises that employees (including contractors, directors and agents) are key to maintaining a compliant and ethical approach to QBE's business practices. Most global policies are supported by Group standards and procedures that provide additional information and guidance to support employees.\n\nThe Group Code of Ethics and Conduct applies to all employees as well as directors, agents and contractors. The Group Code of Ethics and Conduct is complemented by the Group Conduct Reporting & Whistleblower Policy. The Board oversees, and receives reports on compliance with amongst other things, the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct. The Group Conflicts of Interest Policy operates in conjunction with the Group Gift and Entertainment Policy, to create a system to identify and report actual, perceived or potential conflicts of interest. In recognition of the importance of protecting employee and customer data across QBE, we have a global privacy framework that is periodically reviewed and updated to reflect developments in privacy laws across the global footprint.\n\nQBE's policy framework also addresses sanctions, outsourcing, modern slavery, anti-bribery and corruption, health, safety and wellbeing, continuous disclosure, diversity and inclusion, securities trading, flexible working, supplier sustainability, and environment and energy. Policy summaries are available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies. Material breaches and incidents relating to the policies within the policy framework, including the Group Code of Ethics and Conduct and the Group Conduct Reporting & Whistleblower Policy, are required to be recorded and reported to the Board.\n\nGlobal policies are also in place to address the prudential requirements of APRA, including risk management, cyber risk, business continuity management, reinsurance management, fitness and propriety and material outsourcing.\n\nIn Australia, QBE complies with the General Insurance Code of Practice, an industry code relating to the provision of products and services to customers of the general insurance industry in Australia. The Code Governance Committee is the independent body that monitors and enforces insurers' compliance with the Code. The General Insurance Code of Practice will also have sections that are enforceable by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Discussion as to identification of relevant sections is ongoing with ASIC and the Insurance Council of Australia. QBE's Australian business is also a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority, the external dispute resolution scheme that deals with complaints from consumers related to financial services.",

        "page_content": "## Inclusion of Diversity\n\nPeople are at the heart of our business, and its essential to our success that we create a workplace culture and influence the external environment so that our people, customers, suppliers and stakeholders feel included. At QBE, Inclusion of Diversity (IoD) is a fundamental component of our QBE DNA - it is part of who we are and how we operate.\n\nIn early 2022, we launched our new approach IoD, with a broad view of diversity that includes the ways all people are visibly and invisibly different. We know that to realise the benefits of all the ways we are different, we must create an environment where everyone is, and feels they are, included. Our refreshed policy sets out our expectations for how we interact with each other, and our aspiration to be a positive influence for IoD beyond the boundaries of the organisation.\n\nTo achieve this, the GEC has set the following key global focus areas, which are overseen and progressed by the GEC and monitored by the People & Remuneration Committee of the Board:\n\n## AREA OF FOCUS\n\n## ACHIEVEMENTS IN 2022\n\n## Diverse workforce\n\nincluding diverse leadership representation, diverse pipeline of talent and fair remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWomen on the Group Board goal\n\n## 40% by 2025\n\nachieved\n\n## Pledge to HESTA's 40:40 Vision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 This year, we achieved our 2025 goal of 40% women on the Board early, and continued to make headway towards our target of 40% women in leadership across QBE. We were proud to be the first insurer to sign up to HESTA's 40:40 Vision (see below at Gender balance at Board and senior management levels). We continue to identify opportunities for further progression, and to develop targeted initiatives to address attraction, progression, and retention of women in leadership at QBE.\n- \u00b7 We continue to assess pay equity in our workforce based on key drivers such as role, location, and performance, enabling us to identify areas for improvement. On average, our gender pay equity gap is sufficiently negligible that we are confident our people are paid equally in like-for-like roles. We recognise that some pay gaps remain at an individual level and will address any gaps through ongoing review processes.\n- \u00b7 In Europe, our pay equity review now includes both gender and ethnicity. In 2022 we partnered with a diversity and behavioural science expert to carry out a deep dive into experiences by ethnicity. This highlighted that some aspects of our processes were creating barriers to success and negatively impacted ethnic minority colleagues. We have since created a comprehensive ethnicity action plan and ethnicity targets for our UK workforce, which supports the achievement and retention of our ethnic minority employees.\n- \u00b7 We launched a School Partnership Programme in the UK that consists of a four-week paid work placement and eight weeks mentoring, targeted at students from ethnically diverse backgrounds between 16-19 years old who may not have previously considered insurance as a viable career option.\n- \u00b7 In Australia, education and employment pathways remain central to our commitment to reconciliation and the CareerTrackers internship program plays a critical role. Through our long-standing partnership with CareerTrackers, we continue to host Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interns who bring a wealth of knowledge to our business in terms of skill, enthusiasm, and sharing their unique perspectives. We have now hosted 37 interns through CareerTrackers to date.\n- \u00b7 QBE North America developed the QBE Early Career Programs which consists of summer internships and underwriting programs, providing opportunities for the next generation of leaders to gain awareness and professional experience within the insurance industry. This includes a 10-week summer internship program designed to build relationships with peers, senior leaders and business leads. QBE North America also runs a one-year underwriting program designed to teach, develop, and ultimately prepare early entrants to the insurance industry training as an underwriter in the middle market business.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

During 2022, we saw an increase from 35.9% to 38.6% women in leadership, and achieved our goal of 40% women on the Group Board early, reaching 44.4% in July 2022. 39.8% of all leader hires and 51.5% of leader promotions were women, reflecting the continued focus on gender diversity in leadership.\n\nTo further QBE's commitment to gender diversity, in May 2022 QBE became the first insurer to sign up to HESTA's 40:40 Vision, pledging to have minimum of 40% women, 40% men and 20% any gender on the executive committee by 2030 - a principle we currently meet, with 45.5% women.\n\nAdditionally, interim goals were set of having above 37% women in leadership by 2023, in line with our year-on-year progression towards our 2025 target, and met early with 38.6%, and an improvement in pipeline for GEC (L1-L3) from a 2025 baseline in 2027 * .

QBE also makes an annual filing to comply with the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 (Cth) (WGEA) in Australia disclosing our performance against the 'Gender Equality Indicators'. The report can be found at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Communications with shareholders\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nQBE is committed to regularly communicating with its shareholders and other stakeholders in a timely and accessible manner, and encouraging shareholder participation at its AGM.

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance statement continued\n\n## Annual General Meetings\n\nQBE welcomes and encourages shareholder participation at its AGM, in person, online or by proxy. The AGM is held in Sydney each year. In 2022, QBE held a hybrid AGM. Shareholders were able to:\n\n- \u00b7 participate by attending the meeting in person, watching online or dialling in to the teleconference;\n- \u00b7 ask questions in person, online or on the telephone once they were verified; and\n- \u00b7 vote by appointing a proxy, direct voting prior to the AGM and direct voting online during the AGM.\n\nWithin the required statutory period before each AGM, QBE distributes to shareholders a notice of meeting and proxy form in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 , the ASX Listing Rules and the Company's Constitution. To encourage effective participation at AGMs, QBE:\n\n- \u00b7 issues notices of meeting that are honest, accurate and not misleading;\n- \u00b7 includes explanatory notes for all resolutions included in the notice;\n- \u00b7 provides a proxy form which clearly indicates how a shareholder may appoint a proxy, direct their proxy how to vote on a particular resolution if they so choose and, if they appoint the Chair of the meeting as their proxy, how the Chair intends to vote undirected proxies;\n- \u00b7 only combines or 'bundles' resolutions in notices of meeting in limited circumstances; and\n- \u00b7 provides shareholders with the opportunity to lodge proxies electronically.\n\nShareholders are encouraged to provide questions or comments ahead of the AGM so that these can be addressed at the meeting. QBE will make directors, members of the management team and the external auditor available to shareholders at the AGM to respond to questions regarding the items of business, including about the conduct of the audit and the preparation and content of the auditor's report.\n\nVotes at the AGM are by way of a poll i.e. one vote for each fully paid ordinary share held.\n\n## Continuous disclosure\n\nQBE takes its continuous disclosure obligations seriously and issues market releases during the year to satisfy those obligations. Significant developments affecting QBE may be the subject of an announcement to the ASX. All ASX announcements are placed on QBE's website at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/asx-announcements as soon as practicable after release. The Board and relevant management also receive copies of all material market announcements promptly after they have been made. QBE's Continuous Disclosure Policy is available at www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance/global-policies.\n\n## Verification of periodic corporate reports\n\nQBE prepares periodic corporate reports for the benefit of investors such as annual reports, half year reports and sustainability reports. QBE follows a robust process for satisfying itself that each report is materially accurate and balanced, and that it provides investors with appropriate information to make investment decisions.\n\nPeriodic corporate reports are drafted by staff with direct responsibility for, or expertise in, the subject matter and are supported by evidence, including by documenting the various sources of information and consultation undertaken within QBE or with external parties. The information is then reviewed by senior management who have the knowledge and skills to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided. QBE uses an independent assurance engagement to confirm that certain data in the annual sustainability report has been prepared and presented appropriately in all material aspects.\n\nThe Board and its Committees review and approve statutory and other significant corporate reports prior to release to the market. All other periodic corporate reports are submitted for approval to the Disclosure Committee, a committee comprised of senior executives including the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Financial and other reporting\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Board has an Audit Committee which meets at least quarterly to support the Board in overseeing the effectiveness of the Group's financial reporting and risk management framework. In particular, the Audit Committee oversees and monitors the integrity of the Group's financial reporting, including climate-related financial disclosures. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing the management of tax risks. The Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors, all of whom have financial expertise, and is chaired by Jann Skinner.\n\n## Group Chief Executive O/fficer and Group Chief Financial O/fficer declaration\n\nPrior to the Audit Committee's review and the Board's approval of the 2022 Annual Report, the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer provided a declaration to the Board that, in their opinion, the financial records were properly maintained, that the financial statements complied with the appropriate accounting standards and that they gave a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of QBE. The declaration also provides that the opinion of the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer was based on a sound system of risk management and internal control which is operating effectively.\n\n## External auditor independence\n\nQBE firmly believes that the external auditor must be, and must be seen to be, independent. The external auditor confirms its independence and the Audit Committee verifies this by separate enquiry. The Audit Committee regularly meets with the external auditor in the absence of management. The external auditor attends the AGM and a representative is available to answer questions from shareholders relevant to the audit.",

        "page_content": "The Audit Committee has free and unfettered access to the external auditor. The external auditor has free and unfettered access to the Audit Committee.\n\nQBE has issued an internal policy on external auditor independence. Under this policy, the external auditor is not allowed to provide the excluded services of preparing accounting records, financial reports or asset or liability valuations. Furthermore, it cannot act in a management capacity, as an advocate, as a custodian of assets or as a share registry.\n\nThe Board believes some non-audit services are appropriate given the external auditor's knowledge of the Group. QBE may engage the external auditor for some non-audit services, subject to the general principle that fees for non-audit services excluding audit-related and assurance services should not exceed 50% of all fees paid to the external auditor in any one financial year. External tax services are generally provided by an accounting firm other than the external auditor.\n\nThe Audit Committee approves the audit plan each year and receives information on the external auditor's fees. QBE also considers the terms of engagement of the external auditor every few years. The Corporations Act 2001 and Australian professional auditing standards require rotation of the lead engagement partner after five years. The lead engagement partner of the external auditor was last rotated in 2019.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly reviews the need to rotate external auditors and if the Audit Committee thought it appropriate to change the firm undertaking QBE's external audit, it would conduct a competitive tender process.\n\n## Actuarial review\n\nThe central estimate of QBE's insurance liabilities, comprising outstanding claims and premium liabilities, is determined by experienced internal actuarial staff. Actuarial staff form an independent view of both the central estimate and the probability of adequacy of outstanding claims and premium liabilities. At 31 December 2022, close to 100% of QBE's outstanding claims central estimate was also reviewed by external actuaries.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nA global internal audit function is a core part of QBE's three lines of defence approach to effective risk management. QBE's Group Internal Audit team is an independent global function that operates on an integrated basis and is managed by the Group Head of Internal Audit. Group Internal Audit is formally accountable to the Chair of the Audit Committee and has an administrative reporting line to the Group Chief Financial Officer. Group Internal Audit operates under an Audit Committee-approved internal audit charter that provides Group Internal Audit with free and unrestricted access to the Audit Committee, and all management, records and properties.\n\nGroup Internal Audit's primary purpose is to assist the Audit Committee and senior management to discharge their responsibility for sound and prudent management of risk at QBE. Group Internal Audit does this by performing audits, reviews and investigations to provide independent assurance that the design and operation of controls across QBE's international operations are effective.\n\nGroup Internal Audit develops and delivers an annual risk-based internal audit plan that is aligned to QBE's risk management framework and includes audits to address relevant regulatory requirements. The annual Group Internal Audit plan is designed so that higher materiality risk processes are reviewed more frequently. Audit findings and related themes are reported to management, local audit committees and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Risk management\n\nQBE is in the business of managing risk. The Board and management are fully committed to adopting a disciplined approach to managing risk, delivering leading practice and maintaining robust and independent risk management processes and systems.\n\nQBE's Enterprise Risk Management Framework supports its businesses across all divisions and provides a sound foundation for reducing uncertainty and volatility in business performance.\n\nFurther details of how QBE manages risk are set out in the Group Chief Risk Officer's report and the climate change sections of the Annual Report on pages 32 to 43. An overview of QBE's Enterprise Risk Management Framework, including QBE's material risks and how these are mitigated, is also set out in note 4 to the financial statements.\n\n## Risk & Capital Committee\n\nThe Board monitors QBE's performance and, as such, plays a significant role in monitoring that an effective risk management strategy is established and maintained. The Board has a Risk & Capital Committee which meets at least quarterly to support the Board in overseeing the effectiveness of QBE's risk and capital management frameworks. The proper oversight of these frameworks supports strategic objectives, informs business plans and enables current and future risks to be identified, assessed and monitored in line with risk appetite. Under its charter, the Risk & Capital Committee is required to review the Enterprise Risk Management Framework periodically to confirm it continues to be sound. This review was undertaken during 2022 as part of the annual refresh of the Risk Management Strategy. The Risk & Capital Committee is also responsible for overseeing QBE's ESG responsibilities and performance, and external reporting relating to this.\n\nThe Risk & Capital Committee is comprised of independent directors and is chaired by Rolf Tolle. The Risk & Capital Committee has free and unfettered access to the Group Chief Risk Officer and other relevant senior management.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance risk\n\nInformation about how QBE approaches sustainability and the management of ESG issues can be found in the climate change disclosures section on pages 34 to 43 of the Annual Report and in the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5",

Risk-free rates increased across all currencies throughout the year as central banks undertook aggressive actions to combat inflation. This resulted in a $1,214 million benefit to the underwriting result, which was more than offset by a $1,343 million adverse mark-to-market impact on our fixed income portfolio.\n\nGross written premium increased by $1,544 million mainly as a result of continued premium rate increases, stable retention and targeted new business growth, with particularly strong growth in Crop. Reinsurance expense increased by $1,113 million mainly reflecting the growth in Crop, where net retention was managed through the placement of an external quota share, combined with the cost of the transaction to reinsure prior accident year North American Excess and Surplus (E&S) liabilities.\n\nThe Group reported a statutory underwriting profit of $2,042 million compared with $1,138 million in the prior year, equating to a combined operating ratio of 85.7% compared with 91.5%. Excluding the impacts of changes in risk-free rates, the combined operating ratio was 94.2% compared with 93.7% in the prior year, reflecting the impacts of the E&S transaction and the Australian pricing promise review.\n\nThe net claims ratio was 58.1% compared with 62.4% in the prior year. Excluding the impact of changes in risk-free rates, the net claims ratio was 66.6% compared with 64.6% in the prior year. The beneficial impact of the E&S transaction and the release of the remaining $160 million of COVID-19 risk margin was more than offset by an increase in ex-cat and catastrophe claims and prior accident year claims development.",

        "page_content": "The combined commission and expense ratio decreased to 27.6% from 29.1% in the prior year. The net commission ratio reduced to 14.8% from 15.5% in the prior year, primarily due to income from the increased quota share in Crop and favourable business mix, partly offset by the impacts of the E&S reinsurance transaction. The Group's expense ratio decreased to 12.8% from 13.6% in the prior year, mainly reflecting disciplined cost management, favourable business mix and ongoing operating leverage driven by strong premium growth.\n\nTotal investment loss was $776 million compared with an investment income of $122 million in the prior year. Excluding the impacts of changes in risk-free rates, total investment income was $567 million compared with $382 million in the prior year. Wider credit spreads and unrealised losses on developed and emerging market equity and enhanced fixed income investments were more than offset by favourable returns from unlisted property and infrastructure assets.\n\nThe Group's effective tax rate was 15.3% compared with 17.1% in the prior year reflecting the mix of corporate tax rates in the jurisdictions in which QBE operates and the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses in the North American tax group.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe directors are announcing a final dividend of 30 Australian cents per share (2021 19 Australian cents per share). The final dividend will be 10% franked (2021 10%). The 2022 full year dividend payout is A$578 million compared with A$443 million for 2021. Further details of dividends paid during the year are set out in note 5.4 to the financial statements.\n\n## Activities\n\nThe principal activities of QBE during the year were underwriting general insurance and reinsurance risks, management of Lloyd's syndicates and investment management.\n\n## Presentation currency\n\nThe Group has presented the Financial Report in US dollars because a significant proportion of its underwriting activity is denominated in US dollars. The US dollar is also the currency that is widely understood by the global insurance industry, international investors and analysts.\n\n## Operating and financial review\n\nInformation on the Group's results, operations, business strategy, prospects and financial position is set out in the operating and financial review on pages 16 to 25 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Outstanding claims liability\n\nThe net central estimate of outstanding claims is determined by the Group Chief Actuary. The assessment takes into account the statistical analysis of past claims, allowance for claims incurred but not reported, reinsurance and other recoveries and future interest rates and inflation factors.\n\nAs in previous years, the directors consider that substantial risk margins are required to mitigate the inherent uncertainty in the net central estimate. The probability of adequacy of the outstanding claims liability at 31 December 2022 was 90.0% compared with 91.7% last year. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) prudential standards provide a capital credit for risk margins in excess of a probability of adequacy of 75%.\n\n## Group indemnities\n\nRule 78 of the Company's Constitution provides that the Company indemnifies past and present directors, secretaries or other officers against any liability incurred by that person as a director, secretary or other officer of the Company or its subsidiaries. The indemnity does not apply to any liability (excluding legal costs):\n\n- \u00b7 owed to the Company or a related body corporate (e.g. breach of directors' duties);\n- \u00b7 for a pecuniary penalty under section 1317G or a compensation order under sections 1317H or 1317HA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (or a similar provision of the corresponding legislation in another jurisdiction); or\n- \u00b7 that is owed to someone other than the Company or a related body corporate and which did not arise out of conduct in good faith.\n\nThe indemnity extends to legal costs other than where:\n\n- \u00b7 in civil proceedings, one or more of the above exclusions apply;\n- \u00b7 in criminal proceedings, the person is found guilty;\n- \u00b7 the person is liable in proceedings brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), a corresponding regulator in another jurisdiction or a liquidator (unless as part of the investigation before proceedings are commenced); or\n- \u00b7 the court does not grant relief after an application under the Corporations Act 2001 or corresponding legislation in another jurisdiction.\n\nIn addition, a deed exists between the Company and each director which includes an indemnity in similar terms to rule 78 of the Company's Constitution.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

The officers of the Group covered by the insurance contract include the directors listed on pages 44 and 45 of this Annual Report, the Group Company Secretary, Carolyn Scobie, and Deputy Company Secretary, Peter Smiles.\n\nIn accordance with normal commercial practice, disclosure of the amount of premium payable under, and the nature of liabilities covered by, the insurance contract is prohibited by a confidentiality clause in the contract.\n\nNo such insurance cover has been provided for the benefit of any external auditor of the Group.\n\n## Significant changes\n\nThere were no significant changes in the Group's state of affairs during the financial year other than as disclosed in this Annual Report.\n\n## Likely developments and expected results of operations\n\nLikely developments in the Group's operations in future financial years and the expected results of those operations have been included in the operating and financial review on pages 16 to 25 of this Annual Report.\n\n## Events after balance date\n\nOn 17 February 2023, the Group entered into a transaction to reinsure certain prior accident year claims liabilities in North America and International. The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and is expected to result in an upfront net cost of around $100 million before tax.\n\nOther than the above and the declaration of the final dividend, no matter or circumstance has arisen since 31 December 2022 that, in the opinion of the directors, has significantly affected or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations or the Group's state of affairs in future financial periods.\n\n## Material business risks\n\nAs a global insurance and reinsurance business, QBE is subject to a substantial variety of business risks. The directors believe that effective management of these risks is critical to delivering value for QBE's stakeholders. It is QBE's policy to adopt a rigorous approach to managing risk throughout the Group. Risk management is a continuous process and an integral part of QBE's governance structure, QBE's broader business processes and, most importantly, QBE's culture.\n\nSome of the material business risks that QBE faces include strategic, insurance, credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance and Group risks. Explanations of these risks and their mitigations are set out in detail in note 4 to the financial statements which we recommend you read. Further details of how QBE manages risk are set out in the Group Chief Risk Officer's Report on pages 32 to 33, the climate change section on pages 34 to 43 and the risk management section of the corporate governance statement on page 57 of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group makes judgements and estimates in respect of the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the most significant of which are in relation to the determination of the net outstanding claims liability, the application of the liability adequacy test and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Details of these, and information on how QBE has responded to uncertainties created by COVID-19, are included in the notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Meetings of directors\n\nMEETINGS OF COMMITTEES\n\n|                       | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE                       | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE                       | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE      | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE      | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE     | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE     | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE              | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE              | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE   | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE        | MEETINGS  GOVERNANCE        |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                       | FULL  MEETINGS OF  DIRECTORS/one.numerator | FULL  MEETINGS OF  DIRECTORS/one.numerator | OF  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS | OF  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS | AUDIT                  | AUDIT                  | &  NOMINATION          | &  NOMINATION          | INVESTMENT             | INVESTMENT             | OPERATIONS &  TECHNOLOGY | OPERATIONS &  TECHNOLOGY | PEOPLE & RE/hyphen.cap MUNERATION | PEOPLE & RE/hyphen.cap MUNERATION | RISK &  CAPITAL        | RISK &  CAPITAL        | SUB/hyphen.cap COMMITTEES 2 | SUB/hyphen.cap COMMITTEES 2 |\n|                       | H                                          | A                                          | H                         | A                         | H                      | A                      | H                      | A                      | H                      | A                      | H                        | A                        | H                                 | A                                 | H                      | A                      | H                           | A                           |\n| Yasmin Allen 3        | 5                                          | 5                                          | 3                         | 3                         | 3                      | 3                      | -

Insurance plays a positive role in our society, adding certainty and supporting communities to protect what matters to them. Since joining the Board, I have had the opportunity to meet many of our employees who are supporting our customers every day. Our people are energised and excited about the new purpose and vision as well as the varied and purposeful careers that QBE offers.\n\nWe operate in a competitive global market for talent and are committed to continually improving our employee experience and workplace culture to attract and retain people. Throughout 2022 we delivered on a range of people-focused initiatives and continued to evolve our robust remuneration practices to enable our strategic priorities.\n\nAn example of this evolution, as highlighted in last year's Remuneration Report, is the launch of our new 2022 short-term incentive plan (the Annual Performance Incentive or API). Through the API, there is increased emphasis on the impact of both what our people deliver and how they demonstrate the QBE DNA whilst achieving their goals. Overall performance is measured through both financial and non-financial measures, aligned to our key results and priorities, including combined operating ratio (COR), Group cash return on equity (ROE), Risk, People and the various initiatives which form part of our six strategic priorities. Pleasingly, the introduction of the API has strengthened our ability to deliver our strategy and drive towards our target culture.\n\nIn addition to the new API, we introduced a DNA Champions award and reinforced our focus on creating a flexible workplace. Investment in our people included the establishment of three new enterprise leadership groups to help strengthen our internal succession pipeline and build collaboration across the enterprise. Progress also continued to be made on the implementation of our Culture Blueprint. We strive for a culture that embraces diversity, seeks feedback, and encourages people to speak up.\n\nListed on the opposite page are a sample of the people-related recognition and awards received during 2022. We are proud to be publicly acknowledged in so many of our locations across the globe for our people programs.\n\n## Performance during 2022\n\nFor 2022, QBE recorded an adjusted cash ROE for incentive purposes of 10.5%, an encouraging result given numerous external challenges and investment market volatility over the year. While our financial performance has been impacted by the increased costs associated with the devastating catastrophes during 2022, our business has demonstrated continued resilience.\n\nThe Group COR for incentive purposes was 94.2%. This performance was despite significant catastrophe activity in all regions, the adverse impact from the Russia/Ukraine conflict, and increasing inflationary pressure.\n\nBoth of these financial measures were between the threshold and maximum ranges set for incentive payouts.\n\n- For more information on 2022 financial highlights, refer to page 5.",

        "page_content": "The API business scorecard considers financial measures alongside non-financial measures for incentive purposes. The inclusion of non-financial measures in 2022 supported our growing maturity as it relates to managing risk and measures our progress against diversity and inclusion metrics and our 2022 strategic priorities. Maintaining this focus will be essential to support the successful embedment of our refreshed sustainability strategy across the business.\n\nOur broader view of performance through the API also considers the individual performance of the executive key management personnel (KMP) when determining incentive outcomes. The assessments against agreed individual performance objectives completed by the Board for the executive KMP results in overall API outcomes which range from 54.2% to 69.4% of their maximum opportunity.\n\nFor the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the 2022 API outcome results in him receiving 98.1% of his target opportunity (65.4% of his maximum opportunity). Of this outcome, 50% is deferred as conditional rights and vests in equal tranches over the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the award.\n\n- For more information on the 2022 API business scorecard and outcomes, refer to pages 67 to 69.\n\nThe 2019 long-term incentive (LTI) which was due to vest in 2022 to executive KMP did not vest and all awards related to that grant lapsed.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nOur people are essential to our business' long-term success and in 2023 we continue to have Our people and Our culture as two of our six strategic priorities, as highlighted on pages 8 to 9. Our overarching aim is to enable a sustainable and resilient workforce to ensure we can continue to deliver to our customers and shareholders in 2023 and beyond.\n\nThe global market for attracting and retaining talent remains competitive, and we continue to invest to ensure QBE stands out as an employer of choice. As such, we are closely monitoring the ongoing impacts of inflation, cost of living pressures and international market competitiveness. We have made limited changes to executive KMP fixed pay and no changes to non-executive director fees in recent years, but we will review these in light of the above factors in 2023.\n\nThe Board is committed to retaining a strong focus on the longer term and alongside fixed pay, will consider the potential for adjustments to levels of LTI opportunity. We will also look at non-executive director fees during 2023 to address any potential market pressures. Any changes that are enacted will be shared in further detail in next year's Remuneration Report.\n\nWe remain focused on building a deeper connection amongst our people to our new purpose and vision, enhancing culture through performance and reward, improving leadership capability and internal succession, and supporting flexibility and wellbeing to ensure we continue to attract and retain the best talent.\n\nWith 2022 being the first year of the new API plan, no major changes are proposed for 2023. We will continue to review how we can incorporate non-financial metrics into our LTI plans in response to regulatory requirements and in support of our sustainability strategy and commitments.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge my appointment to the Chair of the People & Remuneration Committee and Yasmin Allen as a new non-executive director and member of the Committee following the retirement of John M Green and Stephen Fitzgerald. We thank both John and Stephen for their contribution to the People & Remuneration Committee during their time with QBE. Thank you for your support in 2022. As always, we look forward to shareholder feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTan Le  |  Chair, People & Remuneration Committee\n\nThis Remuneration Report sets out QBE's remuneration framework and provides detail of remuneration outcomes for KMP for 2022 and how this aligns with QBE's performance. Accounting standards define KMP as those executives and non-executive directors with the authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, either directly or indirectly.

This was despite elevated catastrophe activity throughout the year, our allowance for the Russia/Ukraine conflict and the adverse impact from higher inflation across all regions. From a divisional performance perspective, North America's catastrophe costs were slightly below allowance despite the impact from Hurricane Ian, while adverse prior accident year claims development (PYD) declined significantly, details on pages 26 to 27. International was impacted by the aforementioned conflict, adverse PYD associated with inflation and an unfavourable COVID business interruption court judgement, details on pages 28 to 29. Australia Pacific delivered a strong result, although catastrophe costs were elevated, marked by significant flooding and wet weather associated with the La Nina weather pattern. This was broadly offset by favourable PYD associated with strong credit quality in LMI, and releases across a number of commercial lines classes, details on pages 30 to 31.\n\n## Group cash ROE\n\nThe Group delivered an adjusted cash ROE of 10.5% for incentive purposes in 2022 which resulted in an outcome between target and superior. Our business has demonstrated continued resilience throughout the year. However, our financial performance has been impacted by the increased costs associated with the devastating catastrophes, the Russia/Ukraine conflict and ongoing inflationary pressures. Pleasingly, the result is the second consecutive double-digit ROE for QBE, the strongest in over a decade, and highlights our building resilience in a year impacted by various external factors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## NON/hyphen.capFINANCIAL\n\nWEIGHTING: 30%\n\nOUTCOME\n\nACHIEVED\n\n100%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk\n\nThe annual risk maturity assessment completed for 2022 received an outcome of 'embedded' across key elements of the Risk Management Framework. This year, higher levels of maturity were identified across risk governance, three lines of defence roles and responsibilities and risk skills and culture. The outcomes reflect improvements made from the risk transformation initiatives completed to date.\n\n## People and culture\n\nThere was strong performance across the people agenda in 2022. We remained focused on becoming an employer of choice in our chosen markets and building and empowering a sustainable and diverse pipeline of leaders. Significant progress towards our 2025 diversity targets was delivered through the achievement of our women in leadership targets. An enterprise-wide new incentive plan was introduced with a focus on both what was achieved and how it was achieved. In addition, advancements in a more collaborative and aligned culture, centred around our new purpose, were reflected in improvements in employee engagement levels.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\nGood progress was made across the enterprise against the strategic priorities in 2022. Work commenced on our portfolio optimisation targets and these were incorporated into 2023 business planning. A detailed reassessment of our geographical footprint and lines of business supporting our medium to long term growth aspirations was completed as part of the sustainable growth priority. Bring the enterprise together delivered greater consistency through more structured collaboration and alignment. We continued to modernise our business through digitisation efforts across QBE, along with the simplification of core IT platforms and progress on leveraging our data and global scale.\n\n- For more information on strategic priorities, refer to pages 8 to 9.\n\nAPI BUSINESS SCORECARD WEIGHTED OUTCOME: Slightly below target\n\nThe Board considered both quantitative and qualitative factors in determining the executive KMP API business scorecard outcome.\n\nSUPERIOR\n\n150%\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

The attendance of other members of the Board at the People & Remuneration Committee meetings strengthens remuneration governance across QBE.\n\nExecutive KMP are required to adhere to a range of Group-wide policies to ensure risks are well managed, strong governance structures are in place and high ethical standards are maintained. The Board approves a comprehensive delegated authority for the Group CEO, which is an integral part of QBE's risk management process. The remuneration governance framework incorporates risk oversight principles so that executives cannot unduly influence a decision that could materially impact their own incentive outcome.\n\nThe performance-based components of remuneration established in QBE's incentive plans are designed to encourage behaviour that supports the Group's long-term financial soundness.\n\nSpecifically, the QBE incentive plans:\n\n- \u00b7 deliver a target remuneration mix balanced between fixed/variable remuneration, short- and long-term and cash and equity;\n- \u00b7 incorporate individual performance objectives through the API that measure demonstrable proactive sound risk management, including an assessment of risk maturity and the setting of a clear and consistent tone about the importance of managing risk;\n- \u00b7 incorporate robust corporate standards for all employees supporting the QBE risk culture;\n- \u00b7 balance performance outcomes based on delivery against a range of financial and non-financial strategic measures which are set in the context of business plans that have been appropriately stress-tested by the Group CRO;\n- \u00b7 enable the build-up of meaningful shareholding with API deferred equity and LTI underpinned by the MSR (refer to page 72);\n- \u00b7 provide the Board with discretion to take other factors into account when determining the appropriate outcome; and\n- \u00b7 allow for multiple risk adjustments: in year, malus for unvested awards and clawback of cash and vested equity (refer to page 71).\n\nAs part of the 2022 year-end process, an assessment of each senior executive's approach to risk management has been completed using input from the Group CRO. This process recognises positive and negative risk culture and risk management through upward or downward adjustment of performance ratings, incentive payouts and consequences (that can include executives leaving the organisation).\n\nAcross the Group in 2022, over 100 assessments were carried out including for executive KMP and divisional executive teams. Based on the assessments in 2022, there were performance rating and/or incentive adjustments applied both upwards and downwards.",

There was no requirement to apply the provision in 2022.\n\nThe clawback provision allows, to the extent permissible by applicable law, all variable remuneration (cash and deferred remuneration) to remain subject to clawback for a period of two years from the date of payment or vesting (as the case may be) of the relevant component of variable remuneration.\n\nThe Board can determine whether to apply clawback to paid or vested variable remuneration and, if so, the appropriate value over which clawback will be applied.\n\nThe circumstances in which the Board may apply clawback include those where it concludes in good faith that there is or has been:\n\n- \u00b7 misconduct leading to material adverse outcomes;\n- \u00b7 a material failure of financial or non-financial risk management;\n- \u00b7 a material failure or breach of accountability, fitness and propriety, or compliance obligations;\n- \u00b7 a material error or a material misstatement of criteria on which the variable remuneration determination was based; and/or\n- \u00b7 material adverse outcomes for customers, beneficiaries or counterparties.\n\nClawback may be applied to any variable remuneration regardless of whether or not the employment or engagement of the relevant person is ongoing.\n\nA review against the clawback provision was completed as part of the year end process. There was no requirement to apply the provision in 2022.\n\n## Consequence Management Policy\n\nThe QBE Consequence Management Policy was adopted in 2022 for implementation in 2023. The policy introduces principles and guidance to ensure consequences for misconduct or poor risk outcomes are fair, consistent and aligned with regulatory requirements.\n\n## Securities Trading Policy\n\nTrading in QBE ordinary shares is generally permitted outside of designated closed periods. QBE's Securities Trading Policy states that non-executive directors and other designated employees must notify any intended share transaction to nominated people within the Group. The policy prohibits the hedging of QBE securities at all times. The purpose of this prohibition is to ensure that there is an alignment between the interests of non-executive directors, executives and shareholders.\n\n- A copy of QBE's Securities Trading Policy for dealing in securities is available from www.qbe.com/investor-relations/corporategovernance/global-policies.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

REMUNERATION GOVERNANCE\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nThe MSR ensures executives build their shareholding to have significant exposure to QBE's share price. Under the MSR, a minimum of three times fixed remuneration for the Group CEO (one and a half times for other executive KMP) is to be maintained as long as the executive KMP remains at QBE. New executive KMP are required to build their shareholdings over a five-year period after becoming executive KMP.\n\nThe value of shareholdings as a multiple of fixed remuneration at 31 December 2022 for each executive KMP is shown on pages 68 to 69. All executive KMP have either met or are on track to meet the MSR requirements at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Treatment of conditional rights on a change in control of QBE\n\nIn accordance with the rules of each of QBE's incentive plans, a change in control is defined as either a scheme of arrangement that has been approved by QBE's shareholders or the acquisition by a bidder of at least 50% of the issued and to be issued QBE shares under an unconditional takeover offer made in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nShould a change in organisational control occur, the People & Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine how unvested conditional rights should be treated, having regard to factors such as the length of time elapsed in the performance period, the level of performance to date and the circumstances of the change of control.\n\n## Use of external advisers\n\nRemuneration advisers provide guidance on remuneration for executives, facilitate discussion, review remuneration and at-risk reward benchmarking within industry peer groups. They also provide guidance on current trends in executive remuneration practices. Any advice provided by remuneration advisers is used as a guide and is not a substitute for consideration of all the issues by each non-executive director on the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\nErnst & Young (EY) currently acts as the independent remuneration adviser to the People & Remuneration Committee. The People & Remuneration Committee and the Board are satisfied that the advice provided by EY during 2022 was free from undue influence.\n\nDuring 2022, management requested and utilised reports on market practice from various reputable sources.

EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\nAt QBE, having the right talent across the Group enables us to create shareholder value, while prudently managing risk and maintaining strong corporate governance. To deliver our strategic ambitions, we must ensure that our executive remuneration framework reflects QBE's desire to attract and retain the best people.\n\nThis section sets out our approach for 2022. The graphs below set out the typical remuneration structure and delivery for the Group CEO and other executive KMP for on-target performance.\n\n## Group CEO pay mix\n\n## Other executive KMP pay mix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive remuneration structure\n\nQBE's executive remuneration structure for 2022 comprised a mix of fixed and at-risk remuneration through API and LTI plan arrangements. Each of these components is discussed in further detail on the following pages.\n\n## FIXED REMUNERATION /endash.cap KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nFixed remuneration comprises cash salary, superannuation/pension and packaged benefits, additional annual benefits and associated taxes. Additional annual benefits may include health insurance, life assurance, personal accident insurance, expatriate benefits, occasional spouse travel to accompany the executive on business and applicable taxes.\n\nFixed remuneration is delivered in accordance with terms and conditions of employment.\n\n## Determining fixed remuneration levels\n\nFixed remuneration considers the diversity, complexity and expertise required of individual roles. Remuneration quantum is set in the context of QBE's broader reward strategy and internal relativities.\n\nTo assess the competitiveness of fixed remuneration, the People & Remuneration Committee considers market data and recognised published surveys.\n\nAustralian-based executive roles are generally benchmarked to the ASX 30 and ASX 10-50 peer group of companies, with a specific focus on global companies and companies in the financial services industry. Overseas-based executives or roles that have a global reach are compared with a peer group consisting of global insurers. The peer group of companies used for remuneration benchmarking purposes is set out in the table below:\n\n| PEER GROUP                                                                                                                                       | DESCRIPTION                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| The financial services sub-peer group is determined based on the industry classification  on the ASX and includes commercial banks and insurers. | ASX peer group              |\n| Consists of large, global insurance companies aligned with the peer group used for the  LTI plan.                                                | Global insurance peer group |\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n2.\n\n## EXECUTIVE KMP REMUNERATION IN DETAIL\n\n## ANNUAL PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN /endash.cap KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nThe API is an annual, performance-based incentive, delivered as a mix of an annual cash payment and deferred award in the form of conditional rights to QBE shares. Performance is measured over a 12-month period. The conditional rights vest in equal tranches over a further four years.\n\n## Performance measures and rationale\n\nThe API plan provides an incentive outcome with a clear link between business performance, risk management and individual behaviours, and allows further discretion by the Board to be applied where warranted. API outcomes are based on a combination of the Group's financial performance, non-financial metrics incorporating sustainability-aligned metrics based on risk, people and culture and strategic priorities, and individual performance assessed both on what has been achieved and how it was achieved during the year. A summary of achievements and positioning against targets is set out in the business scorecard on page 67 and an explanation of the measures and their rationale for use is provided below:\n\n## Financial measures (70% weighting)\n\n## Non-financial measures (30% weighting)\n\n## COR\n\nCOR is the most relevant measure of the underwriting performance of our insurance operations.\n\nCOR comprises net claims incurred, net commission expense and underwriting and administration expenses as a percentage of net earned premium. The measure excludes the impact of risk-free rates because it is consistent with the way we report and the basis on which the market assesses the underwriting performance of QBE.\n\n## GROUP CASH ROE\n\nCash ROE is a measure of how effectively we are managing shareholders' investment in QBE.\n\nFor the API, this measure will generally be measured on the same basis as that used to determine shareholder dividends. As a principle, losses due to unbudgeted amortisation/impairment of intangibles will, other than in exceptional circumstances, be included in cash ROE so that executives remain accountable for the management of intangible assets.\n\n## RISK\n\nRisk outcomes are assessed using the Risk Maturity Assessment, a framework QBE uses to understand how our risk management practices are maturing, how we determine areas of strength and identify areas that may require further investment. This multi-dimensional measure supports how we assess our effectiveness in managing risk, both from a qualitative and quantitative perspective.\n\n## PEOPLE AND CULTURE\n\nInvestment in our people and the strengthening of alignment and collaboration across the enterprise are priorities that enable culture in order to drive performance. Assessing a blend of quantitative measures and qualitative outputs provides a strong lens on people and culture across the enterprise as we look to enable a more sustainable and resilient workforce.\n\n## STRATEGIC PRIORITIES\n\nHow we are actively managing the business to deliver achievements in each of our strategic priority areas is key to delivering our vision. Our focus in 2022 was: portfolio optimisation, sustainable growth, bring the enterprise together and modernise our business. The Board considers how the business performed against each element.\n\n## Individual performance objectives\n\nThe objectives align with strategic priorities. At the end of the year, individual performance of the executive KMP is assessed both on what was achieved and how it was achieved. This embeds QBE DNA behaviours in remuneration outcomes.\n\n## ADJUSTMENTS\n\nAPI outcomes may be adjusted by other items (such as material acquisitions or divestments) not included in the business plan and as deemed appropriate by the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Vesting schedule\n\nThe API vesting schedule is outlined below:\n\n|                               | BELOW THRESHOLD   | THRESHOLD   | TARGET   | SUPERIOR   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------|------------|\n| % of API opportunity achieved | 0%                | 30%         | 100%     | 150%       |\n\nThe API rules provide suitable discretion for the People & Remuneration Committee to adjust any formulaic outcomes to ensure API awards appropriately reflect performance.",

Vesting is subject to service conditions during the deferral period. Malus and clawback also apply.\n\nTo calculate the number of conditional rights to be granted, the award value is divided by the volume weighted average price of QBE shares over the five trading days prior to the grant date. Notional dividends accrue during the deferral period.\n\n- Executive KMP API awards for the 2022 performance year are detailed on pages 68 to 69.\n\n## Leaver provisions\n\nOn voluntary termination, dismissal or termination due to poor performance, all awards are forfeited.\n\n'Good leaver' provisions (e.g. retirement, redundancy, ill health, injury, or mutually agreed separation (in some cases)) will apply such that:\n\n- \u00b7 API opportunity is reduced to a pro-rata amount to reflect the proportion of the performance year in service.\n- \u00b7 Deferred awards remain in the plan subject to the original vesting conditions.\n\n## Malus and clawback provisions\n\nAPI is subject to malus and clawback, as applicable, enabling awards to be forfeited, reduced or have clawback applied at the discretion of the People & Remuneration Committee and Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Malus and clawback provisions are detailed on page 71.\n\n## LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN /endash.cap KEY DETAILS\n\n## Description\n\nThe LTI plan consists of an award of conditional rights to QBE shares. Conditional rights are awarded at no cost to the executive KMP.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nVesting is subject to two performance conditions measured over a three-year performance period:\n\n## Average Group cash ROE (70% weighting)\n\n## Relative total shareholder return (30% weighting)\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nThe three-year arithmetic average of the annual cash ROE over the performance period assessed against targets set in the context of the three-year business plan. The Group cash ROE target is set with reference to the prevailing risk-free rate plus a set margin.\n\n## RATIONALE\n\nCash ROE is the primary financial measure of success for QBE and is most tangible for long-term decision making.\n\n## DEFINITION\n\nTSR is the change in percentage value of an entity's share price plus the value of reinvested dividends and any capital returns measured over the three-year performance period.\n\nTSR of QBE is measured against a global insurance peer group as shown below.\n\n## RATIONALE\n\nThe use of a relative TSR measure enables stronger pay for performance, aligning with shareholders.\n\n## TSR peer group - global insurance peer group\n\n| Allianz SE                         | CNA Financial Corporation         | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc.   |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| American International Group, Inc. | Hiscox Limited                    | The Travelers Companies, Inc.                 |\n| AXA SA                             | Insurance Australia Group Limited | Zurich Insurance Group AG                     |\n| Beazley plc                        | QBE Insurance Group Limited       |                                               |\n| Chubb Limited                      | Suncorp Group Limited             |                                               |\n\n## ADJUSTMENTS\n\nLTI outcomes may be adjusted by other items (such as material acquisitions or divestments) not included in the business plan and as deemed appropriate by the People & Remuneration Committee.\n\n## LTI allocation\n\nTo calculate the number of conditional rights granted, the award value is divided by the volume weighted average price of QBE shares over the five trading days prior to the grant date.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

On voluntary termination, dismissal or termination due to poor performance, all awards are forfeited.\n\n## Malus and clawback provisions\n\nLTI is subject to malus and clawback provisions, as applicable, enabling awards to be either forfeited or reduced or have clawback applied at the discretion of the People & Remuneration Committee and Board.\n\n- Malus and clawback provisions are detailed on page 71.\n\n## Legacy equity schemes\n\nThe information below summarises QBE's legacy incentive plans mentioned in the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Executive Incentive Plan (EIP) - until 31 December 2018\n\nThe EIP was an at-risk reward structure comprised of cash and deferred equity that vested progressively over a five-year period. 40% to 50% of the award was delivered in cash and 50% to 60% of the award was deferred as conditional rights to fully paid ordinary QBE shares.\n\nThe conditional rights were deferred over four equal tranches: 25% over each of the four anniversaries of the award. EIP outcomes were subject to the achievement of multiple performance measures over the one-year performance period including the Group's cash ROE and COR targets, individual performance ratings and, for divisional staff, divisional COR targets.",

    {
        "page_content": "The EIP was replaced by the STI and LTI plans for executive KMP from 2019. The EIP awards made to Sam Harrison prior to his appointment as executive KMP include cash-settled share-based payment awards which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the equivalent conditional rights described above. The benefit received at vesting is indexed to the movement in the A$ value of QBE's shares including dividends declared in the period between grant and vest dates.\n\n## Short Term Incentive (STI) - until 31 December 2021\n\nThe STI was a performance-based incentive delivered in the form of an annual cash payment and deferred award in the form of conditional rights to QBE shares. Performance was measured over a 12-month period. The conditional rights were deferred in two equal tranches such that 50% vested on the first anniversary of the award and 50% on the second anniversary of the award.\n\nSTI outcomes were subject to the achievement of a blend of divisional CORs for 2021, Group COR for 2017-2020, Group cash ROE targets, divisional COR targets in the case of divisional employees, and individual performance objectives reflecting QBE's strategic priorities. The STI was replaced by the API from 2022.\n\n## LTI levelling mechanism - until 31 December 2021\n\nThe LTI levelling mechanism, introduced in 2019, and removed after 2021, effectively puts a ceiling and a floor on aggregate catastrophe claims when determining LTI outcomes, because extreme or benign catastrophe periods can have a material effect across multiple LTI awards as the LTI performance period is measured over three years. The cap and collar uses a range of +/- 1.5% of net earned premium either side of the budgeted catastrophe allowance for which LTI participants are exposed to catastrophe risk. There was no need to adjust the cash ROE for catastrophe claims in 2022. Historically, the cost of catastrophe claims in 2021 was $924 million (2020: $898 million), and being in excess of the range resulted in adjusted cash ROE of 11% in 2021 (2020: (14.2)%).\n\nFor the 2021 LTI, target ranges for each of the three performance years are set at the start of each relevant year and are disclosed in the following year. The target range for 2022 was between 7.9% and 11.9% (2021: between 6.3% and 10.3%) with straight line vesting commencing at 30% from the lower range up to 100% at the upper range. The individual annual ranges will be used to create the target range for the three-year performance period.\n\n## Employment agreements\n\nThe table below summarises the material terms for the current executive KMP which are subject to applicable laws. The terms and conditions of employment of each executive KMP reflect market conditions at the time of their contract negotiation on appointment and thereafter. In addition, the typical treatment of incentives is also provided below.\n\n| CONTRACTUAL TERM                          | GROUP CEO                                                                  | OTHER EXECUTIVE KMP                                                        |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Duration                                  | Permanent full-time employment contract until notice given by either party | Permanent full-time employment contract until notice given by either party |\n| Notice period   (by executive KMP or QBE) | 12 months: QBE may elect to make  a payment in lieu of notice              | Six months: QBE may elect to make  a payment in lieu of notice             |\n\n## Treatment of incentives\n\n## Voluntary termination\n\nAll unvested incentives are forfeited.\n\n## Involuntary termination\n\nOn termination with cause or for poor performance: All unvested incentives are forfeited.\n\nOn termination without cause: For API in the year of termination, the executive remains eligible to be considered for an award on a pro-rata basis, with any award to be determined following the end of the performance year and subject to the standard deferral arrangements. Unvested deferred EIP, STI and API conditional rights remain in the plan subject to the original vesting dates and malus, with clawback provisions included from 2021. Unvested LTI conditional rights may be reduced to a pro-rata amount to reflect the proportion of the performance period in service and may continue to be held subject to the same performance and vesting conditions. Legacy equity awards generally remain in the plan subject to the original performance and vesting conditions; however, the People & Remuneration Committee has discretion to vest these awards in accordance with the original terms and plan rules.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

See note 8.6 to the financial statements on page 158 for more detail.\n- 4 Includes conditional rights and legacy cash-settled awards. The fair value at grant date of conditional rights is determined using appropriate models including Monte Carlo simulations, depending on the vesting conditions. The fair value of each conditional right is recognised evenly over the service period ending at vesting date. Where an award will no longer vest, the related accounting charge for any non-market component is reversed in full and the reversal is included in the table above. This may include conditional rights granted as compensation for incentives forfeited on ceasing previous employment to join QBE. Details of conditional rights are provided on page 80. For Sam Harrison, this includes legacy cash-settled share-based awards ($197,000) relating to grants made prior to his appointment as executive KMP on 1 April 2021 under the 2019, 2020 and 2021 EIP. A description of the EIP is provided on pages 76 to 77.\n\n- 6 The total disclosed in the 2021 Remuneration Report ($24,662,000) includes remuneration of former executive KMP, which are excluded from the above, comprising: Jason Brown ($1,061,000), Margaret Murphy ($1,708,000) and Richard Pryce ($7,713,000).",

NON/hyphen.capEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR REMUNERATION\n\nThe following section contains information on the approach to non-executive director remuneration, their fees, other benefits and shareholdings.\n\n## Remuneration philosophy\n\nNon-executive director remuneration reflects QBE's desire to attract, motivate and retain experienced independent directors and to ensure their active participation in the Group's affairs for the purpose of corporate governance, regulatory compliance and other matters.\n\nQBE aims to provide a level of remuneration for non-executive directors comparable with that of its peers, which include multi-national financial institutions. The Board reviews surveys published by independent remuneration consultants and other public information to ensure that fee levels are appropriate. The remuneration arrangements of non-executive directors are distinct and separate from those of the executive KMP.\n\n## Fee structure and components\n\nThe aggregate amount approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2022 was A$4,750,000 per annum.\n\nThe total amount paid to non-executive directors in 2022 was A$3,387,953 (2021 A$3,398,414).\n\nUnder the current fee framework, non-executive directors receive a base fee expressed in Australian dollars. In addition, a non-executive director (other than the Chair) may receive further fees for chairing or membership of a Board Committee.\n\nNo changes were made to non-executive director remuneration during 2022. Fees for independent non-executive directors will be reviewed later in 2023.\n\nThe non-executive director fee structure in place since 2017 is shown in the table below:\n\n| ROLE      | CHAIR FEE   | DEPUTY CHAIR FEE   | MEMBER FEE   |\n|-----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| Board     | A$663,000   | A$229,000          | A$208,000    |\n| Committee | A$50,000    | -                  | A$27,000     |\n\n## Other benefits\n\nNon-executive directors do not receive any performance-based remuneration such as cash incentives or equity awards. Under QBE's Constitution, non-executive directors are entitled to be reimbursed for all travel and related expenses properly incurred in connection with the business of QBE. All non-executive directors are eligible to receive an annual cash travel allowance of A$42,750 (A$64,000 for the Chair), in addition to fees for the time involved in travelling to Board meetings and other Board commitments.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nQBE pays superannuation to Australian-based non-executive directors in accordance with Australian superannuation guarantee (SG) legislation. Overseas-based non-executive directors receive the cash equivalent amount in addition to their fees. From 1 July 2022, the SG contribution increased by 0.5% to 10.5%. This change is reflected in table 4.1.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, Australian-based directors may elect to opt out of superannuation contributions as long as they are still receiving contributions from at least one employer. In such cases, a superannuation allowance is paid in lieu of actual contributions.",

During 2022, Michael Wilkins, Stephen Fitzgerald, Tan Le, Kathryn Lisson, Sir Brian Pomeroy, Eric Smith and Rolf Tolle elected to sacrifice a portion of their director pre-tax base fees to acquire QBE shares to meet their minimum shareholding requirement over the required period. The amounts are included in the fees approved by shareholders and form part of the A$3,387,953 on page 82. The increase in their shareholdings in 2022 reflected in table 4.2 was mainly as a result of their participation in the DSAP. Travel allowances and additional fees in lieu of superannuation in Australia are also included in fees. Stephen Fitzgerald, Tan Le, Kathryn Lisson, Sir Brian Pomeroy, Eric Smith and Rolf Tolle received additional fees of 10.0% in lieu of superannuation in Australia from 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2022, and 10.5% from 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022.\n- 2 Michael Wilkins, Yasmin Allen, John M Green and Jann Skinner are Australian residents. Superannuation is calculated as 10.0% of fees, up to 30 June 2022 and increased by 0.5% to 10.5% through to 31 December 2022. Superannuation in excess of the statutory minimum may be taken as additional cash fees or in the form of superannuation contributions at the option of the director. For part of 2022, Yasmin Allen, John M Green and Jann Skinner elected to opt out of superannuation contributions and a superannuation allowance was paid in lieu of superannuation contributions.\n- 3 Yasmin Allen commenced in role on 1 July 2022.\n- 4 Stephen Fitzgerald and John M Green retired on 5 May 2022.\n\n## Minimum shareholding requirement\n\nWith effect from 1 April 2014, a non-executive director MSR was introduced for the Board. Under this requirement, non-executive directors have five years to build a minimum shareholding equal to 100% of annual base fees.\n\nTo assist current and new non-executive directors in meeting the requirement, the DSAP was established with effect from 1 June 2014. The DSAP allows non-executive directors to sacrifice a portion of their director pre-tax base fees to acquire QBE shares. Shares acquired in this way are not subject to performance targets, as they are acquired in place of cash payments. Non-executive directors' shareholdings are shown overleaf.\n\nAll non-executive directors have met the MSR as at 31 December 2022, or are within the five-year period to achieve the MSR.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

OVERVIEW\n\n## 1.1 About QBE\n\n## About QBE Insurance Group\n\nQBE is one of the world's largest insurance and reinsurance companies, with operations in all the major insurance markets. Formed in Australia in 1886, QBE employs more than 12,000 people and carries on insurance activities in 27 countries, with operations in Australia, Europe, North America, Asia and the Pacific. QBE's captive reinsurer, Equator Re, provides reinsurance protection to our divisions in conjunction with the Group's external reinsurance programs.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and is a for-profit entity.\n\n## About insurance\n\nIn simple terms, insurance and reinsurance companies help their customers (consumers, businesses and other insurance companies) to manage risk. More broadly put, an insurance company creates value by pooling and redistributing risk. This is done by collecting premium from those that it insures (i.e. policyholders), and then paying the claims of the few that call upon their insurance protection. A company may also choose to reduce some of its own accumulated risk through the use of outward reinsurance, which is insurance for insurance companies. As not all policyholders will actually experience a claim event, the effective pooling and redistribution of risk lowers the total cost of risk management, thereby making insurance protection more cost effective for all.\n\nThe operating model of insurance companies relies on profits being generated by:\n\n- \u00b7 appropriately pricing risk and charging adequate premium to cover the expected payouts that will be incurred over the life of the insurance policy (both claims and operating expenses); and\n- \u00b7 earning a return on the collected premium and funds withheld to pay future claims through the adoption of an appropriate investment strategy.\n\nInsurance therefore serves a critical function of providing customers with the confidence to achieve their business and personal goals through cost-effective risk management. This is achieved within a highly regulated environment, designed to ensure that insurance companies maintain adequate capital to protect the interests of policyholders.\n\nThe diagram below presents a simplified overview of the key components of this Financial Report:\n\nana\n\ngeme\n\ne\n\nenntt  FFrraa\n\nemm\n\ne\n\nm\n\nnt\n\nm\n\nmee\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 About this report\n\nThis Financial Report includes the consolidated financial statements of QBE Insurance Group Limited (the ultimate parent entity or the Company) and its controlled entities (QBE or the Group).\n\nThe Financial Report includes the four primary statements, namely the statement of comprehensive income (which comprises profit or loss and other comprehensive income or loss), balance sheet, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows as well as associated notes as required by Australian Accounting Standards. Disclosures have been grouped into the following categories in order to assist users in their understanding of the financial statements:\n\n- 1. Overview contains information that impacts the Financial Report as a whole as well as segment reporting disclosures.\n- 2. Underwriting activities brings together results and balance sheet disclosures relevant to the Group's insurance activities.\n- 3. Investment activities includes results and balance sheet disclosures relevant to the Group's investments.\n- 4. Risk management provides commentary on the Group's exposure to various financial and capital risks, explaining the potential impact on the results and balance sheet and how the Group manages these risks.\n- 5. Capital structure provides information about the debt and equity components of the Group's capital.\n- 6. Tax includes disclosures relating to the Group's tax expense and balances.\n- 7. Group structure provides a summary of the Group's controlled entities and includes disclosures in relation to transactions impacting the Group structure.\n- 8. Other includes additional disclosures required to comply with Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nWhere applicable within each note, disclosures are further analysed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Overview provides some context to assist users in understanding the disclosures.\n- \u00b7 Disclosures (both numbers and commentary) provide analysis of balances as required by Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 How we account for the numbers summarises the accounting policies relevant to an understanding of the numbers.\n- \u00b7 Critical accounting judgements and estimates explains the key estimates and judgements applied by QBE in determining the numbers.\n\nThe notes include information which the directors believe is required to understand the financial statements and is material and relevant to the operations, balance sheet and results of the Group. Information is considered material and relevant if:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount in question is significant because of its size or nature;\n- \u00b7 it is important to assist in understanding the results of the Group;\n- \u00b7 it helps to explain the impact of significant changes in the Group's business - for example, significant acquisitions or disposals; or\n- \u00b7 it relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that is important to its future performance.\n\n## 1.2.1 Basis of preparation\n\nThis Financial Report is a general purpose financial report which:\n\n- \u00b7 has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 ;\n- \u00b7 complies with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Interpretations as issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC);\n- \u00b7 has been prepared on a historical cost basis as modified by certain exceptions, the most significant of which are the measurement of investments and derivatives at fair value and the measurement of the net outstanding claims liability at present value;\n- \u00b7 is presented in US dollars; and\n- \u00b7 is presented with values rounded to the nearest million dollars or, in certain cases, to the nearest thousand dollars in accordance with ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 .\n\nNew and amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that are now effective are detailed in note 8.1.1.\n\nThe Group has not adopted any Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective as listed in note 8.1.2.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and liabilities of all entities controlled by the Company as at 31 December 2022 and the results for the financial year then ended. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all transactions between controlled entities are eliminated in full. Where control of an entity commences or ceases during a financial year, the results are included for that part of the year during which control existed. A list of entities controlled by the Company at the balance date is contained in note 7.3.\n\nLloyd's syndicates are accounted for on a proportional basis. The nature of Lloyd's syndicates is such that, even when one party provides the majority of capital, the syndicate as a whole is not controlled for accounting purposes.\n\nWhere necessary, comparative information has been restated to conform to the current year's disclosures.\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements continued\n\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022\n\n## 1. OVERVIEW\n\n## 1.2.2 Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect reported amounts.\n\nIn view of the geographic and product diversity of its international operations, the Group has developed a centralised risk management and policy framework designed to ensure consistency of approach across a number of operational activities, subject to the specific requirements of local markets, legislation and regulation. Such operational activities include underwriting, claims management, actuarial assessment of the outstanding claims liability and investment management.\n\nGiven the centralised approach, sensitivity analyses in respect of critical accounting estimates and judgements are presented at the consolidated Group level in order to provide information and analysis which is meaningful, relevant, reliable and comparable yearon-year. Sensitivity disclosure at business segment or product level would not provide a meaningful overview given the complex interrelationships between the variables underpinning the Group's operations.\n\nThe key areas in which critical estimates and judgements are applied are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 net outstanding claims liability (note 2.3);\n- \u00b7 liability adequacy test (note 2.5.1);\n- \u00b7 recoverability of deferred tax assets (note 6.2.1); and\n- \u00b7 impairment testing of intangible assets (note 7.2.1).\n\nThe Group continues to monitor the potential impacts of COVID-19 on key areas of judgement. While the areas of critical accounting judgements and estimates did not change, the impact of COVID-19 resulted in the application of judgement in the determination of the net discounted central estimate and risk margin, and is discussed in the relevant notes where appropriate. Given the continued uncertainty in relation to potential legislative outcomes, the impact of any changes will be accounted for in future reporting periods as they arise.\n\nThe Group has also considered the impact of climate change on the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements, particularly in the context of the risks and opportunities identified in our climate change disclosures on pages 34 to 43 of this Annual Report. Details of how these considerations have been reflected in the critical accounting judgements and estimates are discussed in the relevant notes where appropriate.\n\n## 1.2.3 Australian pricing promise review\n\nFollowing a review of Australian pricing practices dating back several years across a number of policy administration systems and products, the Group has identified instances where policy pricing promises were not fully delivered. As a result, the Group has recognised a provision on the balance sheet and a $75 million net cost (before tax) in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income during the year based on current estimates, of which $53 million relates to customer remediation for premium earned, $15 million relates to interest payable, and $7 million relates to other costs associated with administering the program.\n\nIn estimating the amounts recognised, assumptions have been made based on the findings of the review, including in relation to the number of affected customers, and the premiums and interest refundable.",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.4 Foreign currency\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions included in the financial statements of controlled entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency). Foreign currency transactions are translated into functional currencies at the spot rates of exchange applicable at the dates of the transactions. At the balance date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in profit or loss.\n\n## Translation of foreign operations\n\nThe results and balance sheets of all foreign operations that have a functional currency different from the Group's presentation currency of US dollars are translated into US dollars as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 income, expenses and other current period movements in comprehensive income are translated at average rates of exchange; and\n- \u00b7 balance sheet items are translated at the closing balance date rates of exchange.\n\nOn consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of net investments in foreign operations are taken to shareholders' equity and recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign operation is sold in whole or part and capital is repatriated, exchange differences on translation from the entity's functional currency to the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars are reclassified out of other comprehensive income and recognised in profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Hedging of foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group manages its foreign exchange exposures as part of its foreign currency risk management processes, further information on which is provided in note 4.4.\n\nQBE uses borrowings to mitigate currency risk on translation of net investments in foreign operations to the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars. QBE may elect to use derivatives to manage currency translation risk in order to preserve capital.\n\nQBE also uses derivatives to mitigate risk associated with foreign currency transactions and balances.\n\nThe Group designates hedge relationships which meet the specified criteria in AASB 9 Financial Instruments as either cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Further information on the accounting for derivatives and for designated hedge relationships is provided in note 5.6.\n\n## Exchange rates\n\nThe principal exchange rates used in the preparation of the financial statements were:\n\n|        | 2022           | 2022          | 2021           | 2021          |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n|        | PROFIT OR LOSS | BALANCE SHEET | PROFIT OR LOSS | BALANCE SHEET |\n| A$/US$ | 0.693          | 0.678         | 0.751          | 0.727         |\n| \u00a3/US$  | 1.232          | 1.203         | 1.375          | 1.353         |\n| \u20ac/US$  | 1.051          | 1.067         | 1.182          | 1.138         |\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section provides analysis and commentary on the Group's underwriting activities. Underwriting, in simple terms, is the agreement by the insurer to assume insurance risk in return for a premium paid by the insured. The underwriter assesses the quality of the risk and prices it accordingly.\n\n## 2.1 Revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nRevenue mainly comprises premiums charged for providing insurance coverage. Premiums are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 direct, being those paid by the policyholder to the insurer;\n- \u00b7 facultative, being reinsurance of an individual (usually significant) risk by a ceding insurer or reinsurer; or\n- \u00b7 inward reinsurance, being coverage provided to an insurer or reinsurer in relation to a specified grouping of policies or risks.\n\nOther sources of revenue include amounts recovered from reinsurers under the terms of reinsurance contracts, commission income from reinsurers and salvage or third-party recoveries.\n\n|                                          | NOTE   | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gross earned premium revenue             |        |             |             |\n| Direct and facultative                   |        | 17,429      | 15,493      |\n| Inward reinsurance                       |        | 1,638       | 1,542       |\n|                                          |        | 19,067      | 17,035      |\n| Other revenue                            |        |             |             |\n| Reinsurance and other recoveries revenue | 2.2    | 3,890       | 3,093       |\n| Reinsurance commission revenue           |        | 831         | 634         |\n|                                          |        | 23,788      | 20,762      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\n## Premium revenue\n\nPremium written comprises amounts charged to policyholders, excluding taxes collected on behalf of third parties. Premium is recognised as revenue in profit or loss based on the incidence of the pattern of risk associated with the insurance policy. The earned portion of premium on unclosed business, being business that is written at the balance date but for which detailed policy information is not yet booked, is also included in premium revenue.\n\n## Reinsurance and other recoveries\n\nReinsurance and other recoveries on paid claims, reported claims not yet paid, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) and claims incurred but not enough reported (IBNER) are recognised as revenue. Recoveries are measured as the present value of the expected future receipts.",

The valuation process is performed quarterly and, on at least a semi-annual basis, includes extensive consultation with claims and underwriting staff as well as senior management. The central estimate of outstanding claims is also subject to annual comprehensive independent actuarial review.

Some of the uncertainties impacting these assumptions are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in patterns of claims incidence, reporting and payment;\n- \u00b7 volatility in the estimation of future costs for long-tail insurance classes due to the longer period of time that can elapse before a claim is paid in full;\n- \u00b7 existence of complex underlying exposures;\n- \u00b7 incidence of catastrophic events close to the balance date;\n- \u00b7 changes in the legal environment, including the interpretation of liability laws and the quantum of damages;\n- \u00b7 changing social, environmental, political and economic trends, for example price and wage inflation; and\n- \u00b7 impacts of COVID-19.\n\nThe estimation of IBNR and IBNER is generally subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than the estimation of the cost of settling claims that have been reported to the Group but are not yet paid, for which more information about the claims is generally available. The notification and settlement of claims relating to liability and other long-tail classes of business may not happen for many years after the event giving rise to the claim. As a consequence, liability and other long-tail classes typically display greater variability between initial estimates and final settlement due to delays in reporting claims and uncertainty in respect of court awards and future claims inflation. Claims in respect of property and other short-tail classes are typically reported and settled soon after the claim event, giving rise to more certainty.\n\nCentral estimates for each class of business are determined using a variety of estimation techniques, generally based on an analysis of historical experience and with reference to external benchmarks where relevant. The gross central estimate is discounted to present value using appropriate risk-free rates.\n\nCentral estimates are calculated gross of any reinsurance and other recoveries. A separate estimate is made of the amounts recoverable based on the gross central estimate (refer to note 2.3.2).\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe projected net ultimate cost of COVID-19 related claims is based on detailed reviews of the Group's emerging claims experience and exposure, and allows for the Group's reinsurance protections. Litigation outcomes relating to the Group's property business interruption exposure, as well as the potential for the appeal of these outcomes, continue to be considered in the determination of the net discounted central estimate and risk margin (refer to note 2.3.3). Key recent legislative outcomes include the Australian High Court decision to decline applications for special leave to appeal aspects of the second industry test case judgement, and the UK High Court judgements in respect of the Corbin & King, Stonegate, Greggs and Various Eateries cases.\n\nThere has been no material change to the projected net ultimate cost of COVID-19 related claims during the period, with a modest increase during the period in respect of UK business interruption exposure being partly offset by a release in respect of Australian business interruption exposure, and offsetting movements in other classes.\n\nThe Group has released all of the remaining $160 million of COVID-19 related risk margin (refer to note 2.3.3) during the current period, reflecting the materially reduced uncertainty related to COVID-19 following the outcomes of the court decisions in the UK and Australia.\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

Counterparty credit risk in relation to reinsurance assets is considered in note 4.3. Recoveries are discounted to present value using appropriate risk-free rates.\n\n## 2.3.3 Risk margin\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nA risk margin is determined by the Board to reflect the inherent uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate.\n\nThe risk margin and the net discounted central estimate are key inputs in the determination of the probability of adequacy, which is a statistical measure of the relative adequacy of the outstanding claims liability to ultimately be able to pay claims. For example, a 90% probability of adequacy indicates that the outstanding claims liability is expected to be adequate nine years in 10.\n\n|                                                                    |      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------|--------|--------|\n| Risk margin                                                        | US$M | 1,287  | 1,418  |\n| Risk margin as a percentage of the net discounted central estimate | %    | 8.0    | 8.8    |\n| Probability of adequacy                                            | %    | 90.0   | 91.7   |\n\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange which reduced the risk margin by $70 million (2021 $37 million), the net movement in profit or loss was a release of $61 million (2021 $82 million). This mainly reflects a $160 million release of COVID-19 related risk margin due to materially reduced uncertainty (refer to note 2.3.1) partly offset by an increase relating to underlying growth in the net discounted central estimate.\n\nThe probability of adequacy was 90.0% (2021 91.7%). Net profit after tax would have reduced by $79 million, at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%, if the probability of adequacy was maintained at 91.7%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nAASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts requires an entity to adopt an appropriate risk margin. The resulting probability of adequacy is not of itself an accounting policy as defined by AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors .\n\nQBE reviews a number of factors when determining the appropriate risk margin, including any changes in the level of uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate, the resulting probability of adequacy and the risk margin as a percentage of the net discounted central estimate. The Group aims to maintain a probability of adequacy in the range of 87.5% to 92.5%.",

The determination of the appropriate level of risk margin takes into account similar factors to those used to determine the central estimate, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 mix of business, in particular the mix of short-tail and long-tail business and the overall weighted average term to settlement; and\n- \u00b7 the level of uncertainty in the central estimate due to estimation error, data quality, variability of key inflation assumptions, impacts of COVID-19 and possible economic and legislative changes.\n\nThe variability by class of business is measured using techniques that determine a range of possible outcomes of ultimate payments and assign a likelihood to outcomes at different levels. These techniques generally use standard statistical distributions, and the measure of variability is referred to as the coefficient of variation.\n\nThe appropriate risk margin for two or more classes of business or for two or more geographic locations combined is likely to be less than the sum of the risk margins for the individual classes, reflecting the benefit of diversification in general insurance, but is not determined by reference to a fixed probability of adequacy. The statistical measure used to determine diversification is called the correlation; the higher the correlation between two classes of business, the more likely it is that a negative outcome in one class will correspond to a negative outcome in the other class. For example, higher correlation exists between classes of business affected by court cases involving bodily injury claims such as motor third-party liability, workers' compensation and public liability, particularly in the same jurisdiction.\n\nThe probability of adequacy for the Group is determined by analysing the variability of each class of business and the correlation between classes of business and divisions. Correlations are determined for aggregations of classes of business, where appropriate, at the divisional level. The correlations adopted by the Group are generally derived from industry analysis, the Group's historical experience and the judgement of experienced and qualified actuaries.\n\n## 2.3.4 Discount rate used to determine the outstanding claims liability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nClaims in relation to long-tail classes of business (e.g. professional indemnity and workers' compensation) typically may not settle for many years. As such, the liability is discounted to reflect the time value of money. The table below summarises the weighted average discount rate for each operating segment and for the Group.\n\n|                   |   2022 % |   2021 % |\n|-------------------|----------|----------|\n| North America     |     4.21 |     1.44 |\n| International     |     3.29 |     0.55 |\n| Australia Pacific |     3.73 |     1.12 |\n| Group             |     3.6  |     0.87 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nAASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts requires that the net central estimate is discounted to reflect the time value of money using risk-free rates that are based on current observable, objective rates that reflect the nature, structure and terms of the future obligations.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

All other factors being equal, a longer weighted average term to settlement generally results in a larger impact on the central estimate from discounting.

Each change has been calculated in isolation from the other changes and shows the after-tax impact on profit or loss assuming that there is no change to any of the other variables. In practice, this is considered unlikely to occur as, for example, an increase in interest rates is normally associated with an increase in the rate of inflation. Over the medium to longer term, the impact of a change in discount rates is expected to be largely offset by the impact of a change in the rate of inflation.\n\nThe sensitivities below assume that all changes directly impact profit after tax. In practice, if the central estimate was to increase, it is possible that part of the increase may result in an offsetting change in the level of risk margin required rather than in a change to profit or loss after tax, depending on the nature of the change in the central estimate and risk outlook. Likewise, if the coefficient of variation were to increase, it is possible that the probability of adequacy would reduce from its current level rather than result in a change to profit or loss after income tax.\n\n|                                     |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                     | SENSITIVITY % | 2022 US$M         | 2021 US$M         |\n| Net discounted central estimate     | +5            | (565)             | (564)             |\n|                                     | -5            | 565               | 564               |\n| Risk margin                         | +5            | (45)              | (50)              |\n|                                     | -5            | 45                | 50                |\n| Inflation rate                      | +1            | (333)             | (427)             |\n|                                     | -1            | 304               | 375               |\n| Discount rate                       | +1            | 304               | 375               |\n|                                     | -1            | (333)             | (427)             |\n| Coefficient of variation            | +1            | (148)             | (163)             |\n|                                     | -1            | 148               | 162               |\n| Probability of adequacy             | +1            | (44)              | (53)              |\n|                                     | -1            | 41                | 48                |\n| Weighted average term to settlement | +10           | 149               | 38                |\n|                                     | -10           | (151)             | (38)              |\n\n- 1  Net of tax at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

This table therefore illustrates the variability and inherent uncertainty in estimating the central estimate each year. The ultimate claims cost for any particular accident year is not known until all claims payments have been made which, for some long-tail classes of business, could be many years into the future. The estimate of net ultimate claims payments at the end of each subsequent accident year demonstrates how the original estimate has been revised over time (b).\n\nCumulative net claims payments (d) are deducted from the estimate of net ultimate claims payments in each accident year (c) at the current balance date, resulting in the undiscounted central estimate at a fixed rate of exchange (e). This is revalued to the balance date rate of exchange (f) to report the net undiscounted central estimate (g), which is reconciled to the discounted net outstanding claims liability (h). The treatment of foreign exchange in the claims development table is explained on the following page.\n\nThe net increase (decrease) in estimated net ultimate claims payments (i) reflects the estimated ultimate net claims payments at the end of the current financial year (c) less the equivalent at the end of the previous financial year (b). This is further summarised in note 2.4.1.\n\nThe claims development table is presented net of reinsurance. With insurance operations in 27 countries, hundreds of products, various reinsurance arrangements and with the Group's risk tolerance managed on a consolidated basis, it is considered neither meaningful nor practicable to provide this information other than on a consolidated Group basis.\n\n2012 &\n\n|                                |

The exception is increased participation in Lloyd's syndicates where the estimate of net ultimate claims payments is allocated to the original accident year(s) in which the underlying claim was incurred.\n\nThe Group writes business in many currencies. The translation of estimated net ultimate claims payments denominated in foreign currencies gives rise to foreign exchange movements which have no direct bearing on the development of the underlying claims. To eliminate this distortion, estimated net ultimate claims payments have been translated to the functional currencies of our controlled entities at constant rates of exchange. All estimates of ultimate claims payments for the 10 most recent accident years reported in functional currencies other than US dollars have been translated to US dollars using 2022 average rates of exchange.\n\n## 2.4.1 Reconciliation of claims development table to profit or loss\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nThe table below reconciles the net increase or decrease in estimated net ultimate claims payments in the current financial year from the claims development table (item (i) in note 2.4) to the analysis of current and prior accident year net central estimate development recognised in profit or loss (refer to note 2.4.2).\n\n|                                                                       | 2022                         | 2022                        | 2022       | 2021                         | 2021                        | 2021       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                                                                       | CURRENT  ACCIDENT  YEAR US$M | PRIOR  ACCIDENT  YEARS US$M | TOTAL US$M | CURRENT  ACCIDENT  YEAR US$M | PRIOR  ACCIDENT  YEARS US$M | TOTAL US$M |\n| Movement in estimated net ultimate claims payments  (note 2.4) 1, 2,3 | 9,536                        | (70)                        | 9,466      | 8,463                        | (142)                       | 8,321      |\n| Movement in claims settlement costs                                   | 441                          | 1                           | 442        | 433                          | 1                           | 434        |\n| Movement in discount                                                  | (460)                        | (1,053)                     | (1,513)    | (85)                         | (232)                       | (317)      |\n| Other movements                                                       | 3                            | (7)                         | (4)        | 2                            | 13                          | 15         |\n| Movement in net discounted central estimate (note 2.4.2)              | 9,520                        | (1,129)                     | 8,391      | 8,813                        | (360)                       | 8,453      |\n\n- 2  2022 prior accident year claims includes a benefit of $334 million as a result of the reinsurance of legacy North American Excess and Surplus (E&S) liabilities.

The transaction remains subject to regulatory approval and is expected to result in an upfront net cost of around $100 million before tax.\n\n## 2.5 Unearned premium and deferred insurance costs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\n## Unearned premium\n\nGross written premium is earned in profit or loss in accordance with the pattern of risk of the business written. The unearned premium liability is that portion of gross written premium that QBE has not yet earned in profit or loss as it represents insurance coverage to be provided by QBE after the balance date.\n\n## Deferred insurance costs\n\nPremium ceded to reinsurers by QBE in exchange for reinsurance protection is expensed in profit or loss in accordance with the reinsurance contract's expected pattern of incidence of risk. The deferred reinsurance premium asset is that portion of the reinsurance premium that QBE has not yet expensed in profit or loss as it represents reinsurance coverage to be received by QBE after the balance date.\n\nAcquisition costs are the costs associated with obtaining and recording insurance business. Acquisition costs are similarly capitalised and amortised, consistent with the earning of the related premium for that business. Commissions are a type of acquisition cost and are disclosed separately.",

expected pattern of the incidence of risk, using either the daily pro-rata method or the 24ths method, adjusted where appropriate to reflect different risk patterns.\n\n## Deferred insurance costs\n\nDeferred reinsurance premium is calculated based on the period of indemnity provided to QBE by the reinsurance contract and in accordance with the related pattern of the incidence of risk.\n\nAcquisition costs are capitalised when they relate to new business or the renewal of existing business and are amortised on the same basis as the earning pattern for that business. At the balance date, deferred acquisition costs represent the capitalised acquisition costs that relate to unearned premium and are carried forward to a subsequent accounting period in recognition of their future benefit. The carrying value of deferred acquisition costs is subject to impairment testing in the form of the liability adequacy test (refer to note 2.5.1). Deferred net commission is a type of deferred acquisition cost and is disclosed separately.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES\n\n## 2.5.1 Liability adequacy test\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nAt each balance date, the Group is required to assess net unearned premium to determine whether the amount provided is sufficient to pay future claims net of reinsurance recoveries attributable to the net unearned premium.\n\nIf the present value of expected future net claims including a risk margin exceeds the net unearned premium, adjusted for deferred reinsurance premium relating to future business not yet written, the net unearned premium is deemed deficient. This deficiency is immediately recognised in profit or loss. In recognising the deficiency, an insurer must first write down related intangible assets and then deferred acquisition costs before recognising an unexpired risk liability.\n\n## Expected present value of future cash /flows for future claims including risk margin\n\n|                                                                                     | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Undiscounted net central estimate                                                   | 5,543       | 5,282       |\n| Discount to present value                                                           | (402)       | (98)        |\n|                                                                                     | 5,141       | 5,184       |\n| Risk margin at the 75th percentile of insurance liabilities                         | 189         | 197         |\n| Expected present value of future cash flows for future claims including risk margin | 5,330       | 5,381       |\n\nThe risk margin at the 75th percentile of insurance liabilities as a percentage of the net discounted central estimate is 3.7% (2021 3.8%). The application of the liability adequacy test at 31 December 2022 did not identify a deficiency (2021 nil).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nAt each balance date, the adequacy of net unearned premium is assessed on a net of reinsurance basis against the present value of the expected future claims cash flows in respect of the relevant insurance contracts, plus an additional risk margin to reflect the inherent uncertainty of the central estimate. The assessment is carried out at the operating segment level other than for Europe, Asia and the Group's captive reinsurer, Equator Re, which are assessed separately, each being a portfolio of contracts subject to broadly similar risks and which are managed together as a single portfolio.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nIn assessing the adequacy of net unearned premium, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts requires the inclusion of a risk margin but does not prescribe a minimum level of margin. While there is established practice in the calculation of the probability of adequacy of the outstanding claims liability, no such guidance exists in respect of the level of risk margin to be used in determining the adequacy of net unearned premium.\n\nThe liability adequacy test assumes a 75% probability of adequacy. The risk margin applied in the liability adequacy test is determined on a consistent basis with the methodology described in note 2.3.3 and also reflects the benefit of diversification. The 75% basis is a recognised industry benchmark in Australia, being the minimum probability of adequacy required for Australian licensed insurers by APRA.",

These include premium receivable, reinsurance and other recoveries, and unclosed premium. For these receivables, a provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable. The remainder of the Group's receivables are assessed for impairment based on expected credit losses, the impacts of which are not material. Any increase or decrease in the provision for impairment is recognised in profit or loss within underwriting expenses.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

A sound investment strategy is therefore integral to the success of the Group's operations.\n\nThe Group invests across a diversified range of instruments to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return. Decisions on where to invest are dependent on expected returns, cash flow requirements of the Group, liquidity of the instrument, credit quality of the instrument and the overall risk appetite of the Group.

Term deposits are valued at par. Other short-term money (bank bills, certificates of deposit, treasury bills and other short-term instruments) is priced using interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n\n## Government bonds, corporate bonds, emerging market debt and high yield debt\n\nThese assets are valued based on quoted prices sourced from external data providers. The fair value categorisation of these assets is based on the observability of the inputs.\n\n## Infrastructure debt\n\nInfrastructure debt is priced by external data providers where quoted prices are available or by the external fund manager who may use a combination of observable market prices or comparable prices where available and other valuation techniques. When valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.\n\n## Private credit\n\nThese assets comprise investments in fund vehicles that are valued using current unit prices as advised by the investment fund manager. As the valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES\n\n## Developed market equity and emerging market equity\n\nThese assets mainly comprise listed equities traded in active markets valued by reference to quoted prices.\n\n## Unlisted property trusts and infrastructure assets\n\nThese assets are valued using current unit prices as advised by the responsible entity, trustee or equivalent of the investment management scheme. As the valuation techniques require the use of significant unobservable inputs, these assets have been categorised as level 3.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThese assets mainly comprise investments in exchange-traded commodity products that are listed, traded in active markets and valued by reference to quoted prices. Alternatives also includes strategic unlisted investments which are valued based on other valuation techniques utilising significant unobservable inputs.\n\n## Movements in level 3 investments\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of investments valued with reference to level 3 inputs:\n\n| LEVEL 3                                          | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| At 1 January                                     | 1,697       | 2,285       |\n| Purchases                                        | 200         | 61          |\n| Disposals/transfers to assets held for sale 1    | (98)        | (675)       |\n| Fair value movement recognised in profit or loss | 70          | 86          |\n| Foreign exchange                                 | (60)        | (60)        |\n| At 31 December                                   | 1,809       | 1,697       |\n\n## 3.2.2 Charges over investments and restrictions on use\n\nA controlled entity has given fixed and floating charges over certain of its investments and other assets in order to secure the obligations of the Group's corporate members at Lloyd's as described in note 8.2.\n\nIncluded in investments are amounts totalling $3,538 million (2021 $3,417 million) which are held in Lloyd's syndicate trust funds. In order to conduct underwriting business within some territories, Lloyd's syndicates are required to lodge assets in locally regulated trust funds. Under Lloyd's byelaws, these amounts can only be used to pay claims and allowable expenses of the syndicate and cannot be withdrawn from the trust funds until they become distributable as profit once annual solvency requirements are met. Included in this amount is $790 million (2021 $287 million) of short-term money.\n\n## 3.2.3 Derivatives over investment assets\n\nIn accordance with our investment management policies and procedures, derivatives may be used in the investment portfolio as both a hedging tool and to alter the risk profile of the portfolio. Risk management policies over the use of derivatives are set out in note 4.\n\nThe Group's notional exposure to investment derivatives at the balance date is set out in the table below:\n\n| NOTIONAL EXPOSURE             | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Bond futures and options      |             |             |\n| Short government bond futures | (1,347)     | (1,751)     |\n| Long government bond futures  | 12          | 36          |\n| Short government bond options | -           | (23)        |\n| Interest rate futures         |             |             |\n| Short interest rates futures  | -           | (1,214)     |\n| Equity index futures          |             |             |\n| Short equity index futures    | (80)        | -           |\n\nQBE may also have exposure to derivatives through investments in underlying pooled funds in accordance with the fund mandate. Those derivative exposures are not included in the table above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDerivatives over investment assets are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. They are therefore initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and are remeasured to fair value through profit or loss at each reporting date. For futures and options traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices. The mark-to-market value of futures positions is cash settled on a daily basis resulting in a fair value of nil at the balance date. The fair value of options was not material at the balance date.",

The Group's ability to satisfy customers' risk management needs is central to what we do. QBE aims to generate wealth and maximise returns for its shareholders by pursuing opportunities that involve risk. Our people are responsible for ensuring that QBE's risks are managed and controlled on a day-to-day basis. QBE aims to use its ability to properly manage risk to provide more certainty and improved outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\nQBE applies a consistent and integrated approach to enterprise risk management (ERM). QBE's framework for managing risk sets out the approach to managing risk effectively to meet strategic objectives while taking into account the creation of value for our shareholders. QBE's ERM framework is articulated in the Group Risk Management Strategy (RMS) and Reinsurance Management Strategy (REMS), both of which are approved annually by the Board and lodged with APRA.\n\nThe ERM framework consists of complementary elements that are embedded throughout the business management cycle and culture of the organisation. Key aspects include risk appetite, governance, reporting, risk identification and measurement, modelling and stress testing, risk systems, and risk culture.\n\nRisk management is a continuous process and an integral part of robust business management. QBE's approach is to integrate risk management into the broader management processes of the organisation. It is QBE's philosophy to ensure that risk management remains embedded in the business and that the risk makers or risk takers are themselves the risk managers. Specifically, the management of risk must occur at each point in the business management cycle.\n\nThe Group's strategy for managing risk is to:\n\n- \u00b7 achieve competitive advantage by better understanding the risk environments in which we operate;\n- \u00b7 give confidence to the business to make objective, risk-based decisions to optimise returns; and\n- \u00b7 avoid unwelcome surprises to the achievement of business objectives by reducing uncertainty and volatility through the identification and management of risks.\n\nThe framework is supported by a suite of policies that detail QBE's approach to the key risk categories used by QBE to classify risk as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 strategic risk (note 4.1);\n- \u00b7 insurance risk (note 4.2);\n- \u00b7 credit risk (note 4.3);\n- \u00b7 market risk (note 4.4);\n- \u00b7 liquidity risk (note 4.5);\n- \u00b7 operational risk (note 4.6);\n- \u00b7 compliance risk (note 4.7); and\n- \u00b7 Group risk (note 4.8).\n\n## Risk culture\n\nA sound risk culture underpins QBE's risk management strategy and is a key component of the ERM framework. QBE is committed to, and supports, a strong risk culture.\n\nIt recognises the importance of risk awareness and culture as being instrumental in the effectiveness of the ERM framework. Further information on risk culture is provided on page 32 of this Annual Report.\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## 4.1 Strategic risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nStrategic risk is the current and prospective impact on earnings and/or capital arising from strategic business decisions and responsiveness to external change. QBE classifies strategic risk into five subcategories, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Performance risk: QBE is not able to achieve its performance objectives.\n- \u00b7 Capital risk: QBE's structure and availability of capital do not meet regulatory requirements and/or support strategic initiatives.\n- \u00b7 Reputational risk: QBE's stakeholders have a negative perception of QBE's brand which may damage QBE's reputation and threaten overall performance.\n- \u00b7 Environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk: this is the negative impact on QBE's strategic priorities or objectives from ESG issues.\n- \u00b7 Emerging risk: these are new or future risks which are difficult to assess but may have a significant impact to QBE or the markets in which it operates.\n\nQBE's approach to managing strategic risk is underpinned by the Group strategic risk appetite statement as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Performance risk\n\nFailure to deliver acceptable performance can result in shareholders losing confidence, impacting our reputation in the market and ultimately impacting our ability to deliver our strategic objectives.\n\nQBE evaluates performance risk by assessing potential earnings volatility against its risk appetite and considering the changing levels of risk in its business plan. The plan is supported by an established regime of attestations by chief underwriting officers, chief actuaries, chief financial officers and chief risk officers, enabling action prior to signing off the business plan and making market commitments. Performance risk is monitored throughout the year against committed business plans (supported by performance monitoring, cell reviews, and mid-year risk reviews).\n\n## Capital risk\n\nThe Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) outlines QBE's approach to:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the risks arising from its activities and ensuring that capital held is commensurate with the level of risk; and\n- \u00b7 maintaining adequate capital over time, including the setting of capital targets consistent with risk profile, risk appetite and regulatory capital requirements.\n\nQBE maintains a level of eligible regulatory capital that exceeds requirements, with the capital target set at a multiple of 1.6-1.8 times the Prescribed Capital Amount (PCA).\n\nAll regulated controlled entities are required to maintain a minimum level of capital to meet obligations to policyholders. It is the Group's policy that each regulated entity maintains a capital base appropriate to its size, business mix, complexity and risk profile which fully complies with and meets or exceeds local regulatory requirements.\n\nQBE aims to maintain the ratio of borrowings to total capital at 15%-30%. At the balance date, this ratio was 23.4% (2021 26.9%, or 24.1% when excluding the subordinated debt redeemed in May 2022).\n\nThe ICAAP also sets out QBE's approach to:\n\n- \u00b7 accessing potential sources of additional capital if required;\n- \u00b7 setting and monitoring risk indicators and triggers for capital levels, to alert management to periods of potential heightened risk;\n- \u00b7 outlining the management actions that can be used to mitigate the potential implications of heightened risk;\n- \u00b7 undertaking stress testing and scenario analysis to anticipate, and be better prepared for, certain adverse events;\n- \u00b7 assessing the quality and composition of capital to meet regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and rules; and\n- \u00b7 determining and monitoring capital allocation and ensuring that QBE earns an effective rate of return on its capital deployed.\n\nThe governance over the ICAAP includes the Board and Board Committees, the Executive Investment & Capital Committee, the Executive Risk Committee, senior management, and supporting functions.",

        "page_content": "## Reputational risk\n\nQBE assesses reputational risk through the quality of the relationships with key stakeholders, including shareholders, regulators, customers, governments, communities, employees, and third-party partners including distributors and suppliers. Each of these relationships is managed through divisional and Group teams, including corporate affairs, human resources, regulatory, compliance and distribution teams.\n\n## ESG and emerging risks\n\nQBE's ESG risk and emerging risk standards operationalise QBE's approach to managing ESG and emerging risks respectively, including climate change. Horizon scans are performed to identify and assess the key ESG and emerging risks. Our approach to managing these risks includes development of underwriting and investment policies, monitoring frameworks and stress and scenario analysis. ESG and emerging risks are regularly reported to the Executive Risk Committee and the Board Risk & Capital Committee.\n\nClimate change is a material business risk for QBE, potentially impacting our business and customers in the medium to long term. We have considered short-term scenarios that could affect our insurance business written to date and current investments. Climate change is expected to increasingly impact the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes over the long term. In the short term, it is often difficult to distinguish the impact of climate change from the normal variability in weather and natural catastrophes. Claims in respect of classes most impacted by these events (e.g. property classes) are typically reported and settled soon after the claim event, and climate change is therefore not expected to materially impact the level of uncertainty in estimating the ultimate cost of those claims. QBE looks to manage for natural catastrophe volatility by considering a wide range of event frequency and severity scenarios in our capital planning, and by purchasing a comprehensive Group catastrophe reinsurance program.\n\nQBE's investments continue to be resilient with respect to climate transition risks as they have limited exposure to highly impacted sectors. Given the medium to long-term nature of the estimated impacts of climate transition, this factor is not expected to be significant to the fair value measurement of the Group's investment assets at the balance date.\n\nFurther detail on QBE's approach to climate change is included in our climate change disclosures on pages 34 to 43 of this Annual Report.\n\n## 4.2 Insurance risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nInsurance risk is the risk of fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events and claims settlements, relative to expectations.\n\nQBE classifies insurance risk into three subcategories, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 underwriting/pricing risk;\n- \u00b7 insurance concentration risk; and\n- \u00b7 reserving risk.\n\nQBE's approach to managing insurance risk is underpinned by the Group's insurance risk appetite statement which is set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Underwriting/pricing risk\n\nQBE manages underwriting/pricing risk by appropriately setting and adjusting underwriting strategy, risk selection and pricing practices throughout the underwriting cycle. Underwriting/pricing risk is monitored throughout the year against committed business plans underpinned by cell reviews.\n\nQBE's underwriting strategy aims to diversify and limit the type of insurance risks accepted and reduce the variability of the expected outcome. The underwriting strategy is implemented through QBE's annual business planning process, supported by minimum underwriting standards and delegated authorities. These authorities reflect the level of risk that the Group is prepared to take with respect to each permitted insurance class.\n\nPricing of risks is controlled by the use of in-house pricing models relevant to specific portfolios and the markets in which QBE operates. Underwriters and actuaries maintain pricing and claims analysis for each portfolio, combined with a knowledge of current developments in the respective markets and classes of business.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Insurance concentration risk\n\nQBE's exposure to concentrations of insurance risk is mitigated by maintaining a business portfolio that is diversified across countries and classes of business. Product diversification is pursued through a strategy of developing strong underwriting skills in a wide variety of classes of business.\n\nThe table below demonstrates the diversity of QBE's operations:\n\n| GROSS EARNED PREMIUM REVENUE     | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Commercial and domestic property | 5,520       | 5,031       |\n| Agriculture                      | 3,921       | 2,825       |\n| Public/product liability         | 2,248       | 1,983       |\n| Motor & motor casualty           | 1,922       | 1,937       |\n| Professional indemnity           | 1,624       | 1,644       |\n| Marine, energy and aviation      | 1,303       | 1,271       |\n| Workers' compensation            | 1,172       | 1,040       |\n| Accident and health              | 876         | 772         |\n| Financial and credit             | 453         | 511         |\n| Other                            | 28          | 21          |\n|                                  | 19,067      | 17,035      |\n\nInsurance concentration risk includes the risks from natural or man-made events that have the potential to produce claims from many of the Group's policyholders at the same time (e.g. catastrophes). QBE currently uses a variety of methodologies to monitor aggregate exposures and manage catastrophe risk. These include the use of catastrophe models from third-party vendors, realistic disaster scenarios and group aggregate methodology. QBE sets the risk appetite relating to catastrophe risk with reference to the insurance concentration risk charge (ICRC), a capital measure under APRA prudential standards. QBE's maximum risk tolerance for an individual natural catastrophe is determined annually and is linked to a maximum net aggregate allowance of catastrophe claims.\n\n## Reserving risk\n\nReserving risk is managed through the actuarial valuation of insurance liabilities, which is conducted at least half-yearly. The valuation of the net discounted central estimate of outstanding claims is performed by qualified and experienced actuaries, with reference to historical data and reasoned expectations of future experience and events. The net discounted central estimate of outstanding claims is subject to a comprehensive independent review at least annually.",

QBE's exposure to credit risk results from financial transactions with securities issuers, debtors, brokers, policyholders, reinsurers and guarantors.\n\nQBE's approach to managing credit risk is underpinned by the Group's credit risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\n## Reinsurance credit risk\n\nThe Group's objective is to maximise placement of reinsurance with highly rated counterparties. Concentration of risk with reinsurance counterparties is monitored strictly and regularly by the Group's Security Committee and is controlled by reference to the following protocols:\n\n- \u00b7 treaty or facultative reinsurance is placed in accordance with the requirements of the Group REMS and Group Security Committee guidelines;\n- \u00b7 reinsurance arrangements are regularly reassessed to determine their effectiveness based on current exposures, historical claims and potential future claims based on the Group's insurance concentrations; and\n- \u00b7 exposure to reinsurance counterparties and the credit quality of those counterparties are actively monitored.\n\nCredit risk exposures are calculated regularly and compared with authorised credit limits. The Group is exposed to material concentrations of credit risk in relation to reinsurance recoveries at the balance date, in particular to large global reinsurers. In certain cases, the Group requires letters of credit or other collateral arrangements to be provided to guarantee the recoverability of the amount involved. Collateral held for the Group in respect of reinsurance arrangements is $1,809 million (2021 $1,960 million). The carrying amount of relevant asset classes on the balance sheet represents the maximum amount of credit exposure. Collateral held may reduce the level of credit risk associated with this exposure but does not change the total amount recoverable. The credit rating analysis below includes the impact of such security arrangements. In some cases, further security has been obtained in the form of trust arrangements, reinsurer default protection and other potential offsets. This additional security has not been included in the credit rating analysis below.\n\nThe following table provides information about the quality of the Group's credit risk exposure in respect of reinsurance recoveries at the balance date. The analysis classifies the assets according to Standard & Poor's (S&P) counterparty credit ratings. AAA is the highest possible rating. Rated assets falling outside the range of AAA to BBB are classified as speculative grade.\n\n|                                                   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   | CREDIT RATING   |            |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|\n|                                                   | AAA US$M        | AA US$M         | A US$M          | BBB US$M        | NOT RATED US$M  | TOTAL US$M |\n| At 31 December 2022                               |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on outstanding claims 1, 2 | 67              | 4,298           | 1,838           | 30              | 75              | 6,308      |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims 1           | 2               | 2,106           | 744             | 4               | 13              | 2,869      |\n| At 31 December 2021                               |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |            |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on outstanding claims 1, 2 | 2               | 4,713           | 1,662           | 55              | 64              | 6,496      |\n| Reinsurance recoveries on paid claims 1           | -               | 1,701           | 388             | 4               | 25              | 2,118      |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

        "page_content": "## 4.4 Market risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nMarket risk is the risk of adverse impacts on earnings resulting from changes in market factors. Market factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\n\nQBE's approach to managing market risk is underpinned by the Group's market risk appetite as set by the Board and is summarised below.\n\nQBE's approach to managing investment market movements is underpinned by the Group's investment strategy which outlines QBE's view of the markets and its corresponding investment approach.\n\nInvestment market risk is managed through the application of risk and exposure limits. These limits are based on the market risk appetite as determined by the Board and apply to:\n\n- \u00b7 losses generated on the investment portfolio under market stress scenarios. The scenarios assume adverse movements in market factors and are designed to reflect a significant market stress event; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivities to changes in risk factors which have a significant impact on the investment portfolio such as interest rate risk.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nQBE is exposed to interest rate risk through its holdings in interest-bearing assets. Financial instruments with a floating interest rate expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas fixed interest rate instruments expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. Interest-bearing borrowings issued by the Group are measured at amortised cost and therefore do not expose the Group result to fair value interest rate risk.\n\nQBE's risk management approach is to minimise interest rate risk by actively managing investment portfolios to achieve a balance between cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk. The Group predominantly invests in high quality, liquid interest-bearing securities and cash and may use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate risk of the fixed interest portfolio and other financial instruments. The risk management processes over these derivative financial instruments include close senior management scrutiny, including appropriate board and other management reporting. Derivatives are used only for approved purposes and are subject to Board-approved risk appetites and delegated authority levels provided to management. The level of derivative exposure is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Appropriate segregation of duties exists with respect to derivative use, and compliance with policy, limits and other requirements is closely monitored.\n\nThe net central estimate of outstanding claims is discounted to present value by reference to risk-free interest rates. The Group is therefore exposed to potential underwriting result volatility as a result of interest rate movements. In practice, over the longer term, an increase or decrease in interest rates is normally offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in inflation. Information relating to this sensitivity is provided in note 2.3.7. At the balance date, the average modified duration of cash and fixed interest securities was 1.6 years (2021 2.1 years). Although QBE maintains a shorter asset duration relative to insurance liabilities, the Group's overall exposure to interest rate risk is not material given the quantum by which the value of fixed income assets exceeds the value of insurance liabilities.\n\nAll investments are financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Movements in interest rates impact the fair value of interest-bearing financial assets and therefore impact reported profit or loss after income tax. The impact of a 1.0% increase or decrease in interest rates on interest-bearing financial assets owned by the Group at the balance date is shown in the table below:\n\n|                                                            |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                            | SENSITIVITY % | 2022 US$M         | 2021 US$M         |\n| Interest rate movement - interest-bearing financial assets | +1            | (294)             | (398)             |\n|                                                            | -1            | 309               | 328               |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nEquity price risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest rate or currency risk), whether those changes are caused by factors specific to the individual financial instrument or its issuer, or factors affecting all similar financial instruments traded on the market.\n\nQBE is exposed to equity price risk on its investment in growth assets and may use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. The risk management processes over these derivative financial instruments are the same as those already explained in respect of interest rate derivative financial instruments. Exposure is also managed by diversification across international markets and currencies.\n\nGrowth assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The impact of a 20% increase or decrease in the value of investments owned by the Group at the balance date on profit or loss after income tax is shown in the table below:\n\n|                          |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   |\n|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                          | SENSITIVITY % | 2022 US$M         | 2021 US$M         |\n| ASX 200                  | +20           | 8                 | 7                 |\n|                          | -20           | (8)               | (7)               |\n| S&P 500                  | +20           | 8                 | 3                 |\n|                          | -20           | (8)               | (3)               |\n| FTSE 100                 | +20           | 8                 | -                 |\n|                          | -20           | (8)               | -                 |\n| EURO STOXX               | +20           | 11                | -                 |\n|                          | -20           | (11)              | -                 |\n| Emerging market equity   | +20           | 9                 | -                 |\n|                          | -20           | (9)               | -                 |\n| Unlisted property trusts | +20           | 105               | 106               |\n|                          | -20           | (105)             | (106)             |\n| Infrastructure assets    | +20           | 117               | 110               |\n|                          | -20           | (117)             | (110)             |\n| Alternatives             | +20           | 25                | 16                |\n|                          | -20           | (25)              | (16)              |\n\nQBE is also exposed to price risk on its fixed interest securities as discussed above in relation to interest rate risk, and below in relation to credit spread risk. All securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Credit spread risk\n\nMovements in credit spreads impact the value of corporate interest-bearing securities, emerging market and high yield debt and private credit, and therefore impact reported profit or loss after tax. This risk is managed by investing in mostly high quality, liquid interest-bearing securities and by managing the credit spread duration of the interest-bearing securities portfolio.\n\nThe impact of a 0.5% increase or decrease in credit spreads on interest-bearing financial assets held by the Group at the balance date on profit or loss after income tax is shown in the table below:\n\n|                                                              |               | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   | PROFIT (LOSS) 1   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                              | SENSITIVITY % | 2022 US$M         | 2021 US$M         |\n| Credit spread movement - interest-bearing financial assets 2 | +0.5          | (125)             | (114)             |\n|                                                              | -0.5          | 120               | 96                |",

The Group's foreign exchange exposure generally arises as a result of either the translation of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency of a controlled entity (operational currency risk) or due to the translation of the Group's net investments in foreign operations to the functional currency of the ultimate parent entity of Australian dollars and to QBE's presentation currency of US dollars (currency translation risk).\n\n## Operational currency risk\n\nOperational currency risk is managed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Each controlled entity manages the volatility arising from changes in foreign exchange rates by matching liabilities with assets of the same currency, as far as is practicable, thus ensuring that any exposures to foreign currencies are minimised. The Group's aim is to mitigate, where possible, its operational foreign currency exposures at a controlled entity level.\n- \u00b7 Forward foreign exchange contracts are used where possible to protect any residual currency positions. Where appropriate, forward foreign exchange contracts may also be used in relation to the Group's borrowings and may be designated as hedge relationships for accounting purposes. Further information on forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage operational currency risk is provided in note 5.6.\n\nThe risk management process relating to the use of forward foreign exchange contracts involves close senior management scrutiny. All forward foreign exchange contracts are subject to delegated authority levels provided to management and the levels of exposure are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe analysis below demonstrates the impact on profit or loss after income tax of a 10% strengthening or weakening of the major currencies against the functional currencies of the underlying QBE entities for which the Group has a material exposure at the balance date. The exposures below reflect the aggregation of operational currency exposures of multiple entities with different functional currencies. The sensitivity is measured with reference to the Group's residual (or unmatched) operational foreign currency exposures at the balance date. Operational foreign exchange gains or losses are recognised in profit or loss in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.2.4. The sensitivities provided demonstrate the impact of a change in one key variable in isolation while other assumptions remain unchanged.\n\nThe sensitivities shown in the table below are relevant only at the balance sheet date, as any unmatched exposures are actively monitored by management and the exposure subsequently matched. The table below includes derivatives entered into on 31 December 2022 to mitigate exposures not currently reflected in the Group's balance sheet relating to unearned premium and deferred insurance costs balances as their equivalents will be monetary items under AASB 17 Insurance Contracts (refer to note 8.1.2).\n\n|                   | 2022                    | 2022          | 2022                 | 2021                    | 2021          | 2021                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------|\n| EXPOSURE CURRENCY | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | PROFIT (LOSS) 1 US$M | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | PROFIT (LOSS) 1 US$M |\n| US dollar         | 1,066                   | +10           | 75                   | 198                     | +10           | 14                   |\n|                   |                         | -10           | (75)                 |                         | -10           | (14)                 |\n| Australian dollar | 214                     | +10           | 15                   | 95                      | +10           | 7                    |\n|                   |                         | -10           | (15)                 |                         | -10           | (7)                  |\n| Canadian dollar   | 196                     | +10           | 14                   | 15                      | +10           | 1                    |\n|                   |                         | -10           | (14)                 |                         | -10           | (1)                  |\n| Sterling          | 39                      | +10           | 3                    | 14                      | +10           | 1                    |\n|                   |                         | -10           | (3)                  |                         | -10           | (1)                  |\n| Euro              | (103)                   | +10           | (7)                  | 9                       | +10           | 1                    |\n|                   |                         | -10           | 7                    |                         | -10           | (1)                  |\n\n- 1  Net of tax at the Group's prima facie income tax rate of 30%.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6",

RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## Currency translation risk\n\nQBE is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of:\n\n- \u00b7 the ultimate parent entity's net investments in foreign operations to its functional currency of Australian dollars; and\n- \u00b7 all non-US dollar functional currency operations to the Group's presentation currency of US dollars.\n\nCurrency translation risk in relation to QBE's investment in foreign operations is monitored on an ongoing basis and may be mitigated by designation of foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of this risk. Any borrowing that qualifies as a hedging instrument may be designated as a hedge of the Australian dollar ultimate parent entity's net investments in foreign operations and any residual exposure to foreign operations in tradeable currencies may be hedged up to the limit specified in the Group risk appetite statement. The extent of hedging this exposure is carefully managed to ensure an appropriate balance between currency risk and associated risks such as liquidity risk and stability of capital adequacy levels.\n\nQBE does not ordinarily seek to use derivatives to mitigate currency translation risk on translation to the ultimate parent entity functional currency of Australian dollars for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 currency translation gains and losses generally have no cash flow;\n- \u00b7 currency translation gains and losses are accounted for in the foreign currency translation reserve (a component of equity) and therefore do not impact profit or loss unless the related foreign operation is disposed of; and\n- \u00b7 management of translation risk needs to be balanced against the impact on capital requirements and liquidity risk.\n\nQBE may, however, elect to use derivatives to manage currency translation risk in order to preserve capital.\n\nCurrency management processes are actively monitored by Group Treasury and involve close senior management scrutiny. All hedge transactions are subject to delegated authority levels provided to management, and the levels of exposure are reviewed on an ongoing basis. All instruments that are designated as hedges are tested for effectiveness in accordance with AASB 9 Financial Instruments .\n\nFurther information on derivatives and borrowings designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations is provided in note 5.6.1.\n\nForeign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of the Group's foreign operations from the ultimate parent entity's functional currency of Australian dollars to the Group's US dollar presentation currency are recognised directly in equity in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.2.4. The Group cannot hedge this exposure.\n\nThe analysis below demonstrates the impact on equity of a 10% strengthening or weakening against the US dollar of the major currencies to which QBE is exposed through its net investments in foreign operations. The basis for the sensitivity calculation is the Group's actual residual exposure at the balance date.\n\n|                    | 2022                    | 2022          | 2022                             | 2021                    | 2021          | 2021                             |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|\n| EXPOSURE CURRENCY  | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | EQUITY INCREASE  (DECREASE) US$M | RESIDUAL  EXPOSURE US$M | SENSITIVITY % | EQUITY INCREASE  (DECREASE) US$M |\n| Australian dollar  | 3,323                   | +10           | 332                              | 2,702                   | +10           | 270                              |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (332)                            |                         | -10           | (270)                            |\n| Euro               | 1,504                   | +10           | 150                              | 1,538                   | +10           | 154                              |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (150)                            |                         | -10           | (154)                            |\n| Sterling           | 690                     | +10           | 69                               | 782                     | +10           | 78                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (69)                             |                         | -10           | (78)                             |\n| New Zealand dollar | 299                     | +10           | 30                               | 278                     | +10           | 28                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (30)                             |                         | -10           | (28)                             |\n| Singapore dollar   | 127                     | +10           | 13                               | 121                     | +10           | 12                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (13)                             |                         | -10           | (12)                             |\n| Hong Kong dollar   | 149                     | +10           | 15                               | 116                     | +10           | 12                               |\n|                    |                         | -10           | (15)                             |                         | -10           | (12)                             |",

Cash flow forecasting and targeting are conducted at a legal entity level and involve actively managing operational cash flow requirements.\n\nTo supplement the cash flow targeting and to ensure that there are sufficient liquid funds available to meet insurance and investment obligations, a minimum percentage of QBE's liabilities is held, at all times, in cash and liquid securities. QBE also maintains a defined proportion of the funds under management in liquid assets.\n\nQBE actively forecasts cash flow requirements to identify future cash surpluses and shortages to optimise invested cash balances and limit unexpected calls from the investment pool. The Group limits the risk of liquidity shortfalls resulting from mismatches in the timing of claims payments and receipts of claims recoveries by negotiating cash call clauses in reinsurance contracts and seeking accelerated settlements for large reinsurance recoveries.\n\nThe following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on the remaining contractual obligations. Borrowings and contractual undiscounted interest payments are disclosed by reference to the first call date of the borrowings, details of which, including redemption terms, are included in note 5.1.\n\n|                                             | LESS THAN   1 YEAR US$M   | 13 TO 36  MONTHS US$M   | 37 TO 60  MONTHS US$M   | OVER 5  YEARS US$M   | NO FIXED  TERM US$M   | TOTAL US$M   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                         |                           |                         |                         |                      |                       |              |\n| Derivative financial instruments            | 256                       | 131                     | -                       | -                    | -                     | 387          |\n| Trade payables                              | 2,620                     | 197                     | -                       | -                    | 1                     | 2,818        |\n| Other payables and accrued  expenses        | 692                       | 11                      | -                       | 2                    | -                     | 705          |\n| Treasury payables                           | 17                        | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 17           |\n| Investment payables                         | 3                         | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 3            |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 49                        | 88                      | 70                      | 94                   | -                     | 301          |\n| Borrowings 1                                | 406                       | 1,000                   | 863                     | 481                  | -                     | 2,750        |\n| Contractual undiscounted interest  payments | 155                       | 195                     | 49                      | 9                    | -                     | 408          |\n| At 31 December 2021                         |                           |                         |                         |                      |                       |              |\n| Derivative financial instruments            | 130                       | 322                     | -                       | -                    | -                     | 452          |\n| Trade payables                              | 2,123                     | 191                     | 2                       | 1                    | 5                     | 2,322        |\n| Other payables and accrued  expenses        | 767                       | 46                      | 5                       | -                    | 5                     | 823          |\n| Treasury payables                           | 19                        | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 19           |\n| Investment payables                         | 51                        | -                       | -                       | -                    | -                     | 51           |\n| Lease liabilities                           | 56                        | 90                      | 60                      | 148                  | -                     | 354          |\n| Borrowings 1                                | 442                       | 1,106                   | 1,188                   | 541                  | -                     | 3,277        |\n| Contractual undiscounted interest  payments | 162                       | 268                     | 108                     | 17                   | -                     | 555          |\n\nThe maturity profile of the Group's net discounted central estimate is analysed in note 2.3.6.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

external events.\n\nOperational risk can materialise in a number of forms including fraud perpetrated by employees or by external parties (e.g. claims fraud or cyber attacks), employment practices (e.g. losses arising from acts inconsistent with laws or agreements governing employment, employee health or safety, or from diversity or discrimination events involving internal employees), improper business practices (e.g. failure to meet professional obligations or issues with the nature or design of an insurance product), business disruption and system failures, or business and transaction processing failures.\n\nQBE manages operational risk through setting policy, minimum standards, and process and system controls, including effective segregation of duties, access controls, authorisations and reconciliation procedures, business continuity management, fraud management, information security and physical security.\n\nQBE identifies, assesses and manages operational risk through the:\n\n- \u00b7 risk and control self-assessment process, which identifies and assesses the key risks to achieving business objectives and is conducted at the business unit level;\n- \u00b7 operational risk appetite statement, which sets out the nature and level of risk that the Board and Group Executive Committee are willing to take in pursuit of the organisation's objectives. The operational risk appetite statement is measured through an assessment of the control environment, key risk indicators, issues and incidents; and\n- \u00b7 scenario analysis process, which assesses the impact of potentially extreme scenarios and the appropriateness of our contingency planning.\n\nKey residual risks from the above processes are monitored by the Executive Risk Committee.",

In order to conduct underwriting business within some territories, Lloyd's syndicates are required to lodge assets in locally regulated trust funds. Under Lloyd's byelaws, these amounts can only be used to pay claims and allowable expenses of the syndicates and cannot be withdrawn from the trust funds until allowed to be distributed as profit once annual solvency requirements are met.\n\nAlso included in cash and cash equivalents is $126 million (2021 $125 million) relating to policyholder trust accounts in the United Kingdom which can only be accessed by QBE in certain circumstances, such as when QBE is owed a deductible by the policyholder on a claim. The Group recognises a corresponding payable in relation to these until such an event occurs.\n\nQBE has operations in many countries which have foreign exchange controls and regulations. These controls and regulations can vary from simple reporting requirements to outright prohibition of movement of funds without explicit prior central bank or regulator approval. The impact of these controls and regulations may restrict the Group's capacity to repatriate capital and/or profits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and on hand and deposits at call which are readily convertible to cash on hand and which are used for operational cash requirements. Amounts in cash and cash equivalents are the same as those included in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nThe reconciliation of profit or loss after income tax to net cash flows from operating activities is included in note 8.4.",

Forward foreign exchange contracts and purchased currency options may also be utilised in cash flow hedging of foreign currency borrowings and/or hedging exposure to net investments in foreign operations (NIFO).\n\nInterest rate swaptions are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movements on the Group's borrowings.\n\nRefer to note 4.4 for additional information relating to QBE's approach to managing interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.\n\nThe Group's exposure to treasury derivatives at the balance date determined by reference to the functional currency of the relevant controlled entity is set out in the table below:\n\n|                                                               | 2022          | 2022                   | 2022                       | 2021          | 2021                   | 2021                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                                                               | EXPOSURE US$M | FAIR VALUE  ASSET US$M | FAIR VALUE  LIABILITY US$M | EXPOSURE US$M | FAIR VALUE  ASSET US$M | FAIR VALUE  LIABILITY US$M |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts   not in designated hedges | 990           | 251                    | 172                        | 2,143         | 118                    | 161                        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts  used in cash flow hedges  | (1,404)       | -                      | 186                        | (1,599)       | -                      | 291                        |\n| Forward foreign exchange contracts  used in NIFO hedges       | 1,081         | 2                      | 29                         | 489           | 11                     | -                          |\n| Interest rate swaptions                                       | 339           | 31                     | -                          | 363           | 13                     | -                          |\n|                                                               |               | 284                    | 387                        |               | 142                    | 452                        |\n\nThe fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaptions are categorised as level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. They are fair valued using present value techniques utilising observable market data, broker quotes and/or comparable prices for similar instruments in active markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value, determined as the cost of acquisition excluding transaction costs, and remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. Remeasurements are recognised in profit or loss at each reporting date, unless the derivative is designated as part of a qualifying hedge relationship (refer to note 5.6.1).\n\n## 5.6.1 Designated hedges\n\nThe Group's material designated hedge relationships are analysed below by risk category and are accounted for with reference to the accounting policies set out at the end of this note. Hedging ratios, being the relationship between the quantity of the hedging instrument and the quantity of the hedged item, are 1:1 as the nominal values of hedging instruments match those of the hedged items. Any ineffectiveness arising from factors such as credit risk is not expected to be material. Amounts recognised in equity or reclassified to profit or loss are disclosed in note 5.3.2.\n\n## Cash /flow hedges of borrowings\n\nAt the balance date, forward foreign exchange contracts were used to hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecast transactions in relation to $400 million of subordinated debt maturing in 2043 and $700 million of subordinated debt maturing in 2044. Foreign currency risk on future coupons and principal amounts is hedged up to and including the first call dates of the subordinated debt, being 2023 and 2024 respectively. Similarly, an interest rate swaption was put in place to hedge interest rate risk in relation to coupons on A$500 million of subordinated debt maturing in 2036. The swaption is exercisable in August 2023 and hedges coupon payments from that date to the first call date in August 2026. These hedges were put in place to more effectively manage currency exposures and costs of funding.\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\nOnly the spot components of the forward foreign exchange contracts and the intrinsic value of the interest rate swaption are designated in hedge relationships. For forward foreign exchange contracts, reclassifications of hedging gains and losses to profit or loss are included in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1), consistent with the currency movement of the hedged borrowings. For the interest rate swaption, reclassifications of any cumulative hedging gains or losses to profit or loss will occur as related coupon payments are made during the period from August 2023 to August 2026. A 'cost of hedging' election was made in respect of these hedges, as described below, and amortisation of the forward and currency basis components is included in financing costs (refer to note 5.1.2) where they relate to hedged coupons, or in foreign exchange (refer to note 3.1) where they relate to principal amounts.\n\nThe interest rate swaption does not generate any cash flows until August 2023, when the potential settlement would occur if the swaption is in-the-money at that point in time.

The relevant entity also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedge effectiveness requirements are met, including the relevant economic relationship, the effect of credit risk and the hedge ratio.\n\nFor qualifying cash flow hedges and NIFO hedges, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument associated with the effective portion of the hedge is accumulated in equity through other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item also affects profit or loss. For cash flow hedges, this is reflected in the cash flow hedge reserve; for NIFO hedges, this is reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve (refer to note 5.3.2). The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\nWhere the forward and currency basis components of a designated derivative do not form part of the designated hedge relationship, these components are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss unless a 'cost of hedging' election is made. Under this election, the fair value of these components at inception of the hedge are amortised through profit or loss over time periods relevant to the hedge, with other changes in their fair values after inception recognised in equity through other comprehensive income. This election can be made on a hedge-by-hedge basis and is reflected in the cost of hedging reserve (refer to note 5.3.2).\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the qualifying hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, including when the risk management objective is no longer met or is no longer relevant; the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; the hedged item matures, is sold or repaid; or a hedged forecast transaction is no longer considered highly probable. When a cash flow hedge is discontinued, any cumulative hedging gain or loss in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss. If the hedged item is a forecast transaction that is no longer considered highly probable, the cumulative gain or loss is immediately reclassified to profit or loss. When a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is discontinued, any cumulative hedging gain or loss at that time remains in equity and is only recycled to profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operation, forming part of the resulting gain or loss.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

TAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIncome tax expense or credit is the accounting tax outcome for the period and is calculated as the tax payable on the current period taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences and unused tax losses. The relationship between accounting profit or loss and income tax expense or credit is provided in the reconciliation of prima facie tax to income tax expense or credit (refer to note 6.1). Income tax expense does not equate to the amount of tax actually paid to tax authorities around the world, as it is based upon the accrual accounting concept.\n\nAccounting income and expenses do not always have the same recognition pattern as taxable income and expenses, creating a timing difference as to when a tax expense or credit can be recognised. These differences usually reverse over time but, until they do, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognised on the balance sheet. Note 6.2 details the composition and movements in deferred tax balances and the key management assumptions applied in recognising tax losses.\n\nDetails of franking credits available to shareholders are disclosed in note 5.4.\n\n## 6.1 Reconciliation of prima facie tax to income tax expense or credit\n\n|                                                                | NOTE   | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------|\n| Profit before income tax                                       |        | 919         | 913         |\n| Prima facie tax expense at 30%                                 |        | 276         | 274         |\n| Tax effect of non-temporary differences:                       |        |             |             |\n| Untaxed dividends                                              |        | (3)         | (2)         |\n| Differences in tax rates                                       |        | (18)        | (93)        |\n| Other, including non-taxable income and non-allowable expenses |        | 55          | (2)         |\n| Prima facie tax adjusted for non-temporary differences         |        | 310         | 177         |\n| Deferred tax assets recognised                                 |        | (181)       | (18)        |\n| Underprovision (overprovision) in prior years                  |        | 12          | (3)         |\n| Income tax expense                                             |        | 141         | 156         |\n| Analysed as follows:                                           |        |             |             |\n| Current tax                                                    |        | 91          | 169         |\n| Deferred tax                                                   |        | 50          | (13)        |\n|                                                                |        | 141         | 156         |\n| Deferred tax expense (credit) comprises:                       |        |             |             |\n| Deferred tax assets recognised in profit or loss               | 6.2.1  | (193)       | (57)        |\n| Deferred tax liabilities recognised in profit or loss          | 6.2.2  | 243         | 44          |\n|                                                                |        | 50          | (13)        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe current income tax expense or credit is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries in which controlled entities operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to either settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, as appropriate.",

In making this assessment, QBE considers in particular each controlled entity's future business plans, history of generating taxable profits, whether the unused tax losses resulted from identifiable causes which are unlikely to recur and if any tax planning opportunities exist in the period in which the taxable losses can be utilised.\n\nThe recognised deferred tax asset relating to the North American tax group of $390 million (2021 $295 million) comprises $239 million (2021 $105 million) of carry forward tax losses and $151 million (2021 $190 million) of deductible temporary differences, net of applicable offsetting deferred tax liabilities, as a result of insurance technical reserves and the tax deductibility of goodwill and other intangibles.\n\nUncertainty continues to exist in relation to the utilisation of this asset, which is subject to there being continued future taxable profits over the period of time in which the losses can be utilised. QBE has made a judgement that the North American tax group will be able to generate sufficient taxable profits over the foreseeable future, based upon its future business plans. Key assumptions include an expectation of future taxable profit driven by no material deterioration in the prior accident year central estimate, a sustained return to underwriting profitability, benefits flowing from initiatives to reduce the cost base of the division and future increases in investment yields. Losses expire over the next 18 years, with the majority expiring between 2031 and 2040. The uncertainty around the recognition of the deferred tax asset will be resolved in future years if taxable profits are generated. Recovery of the asset continues to be sensitive to changes in the combined operating ratio, premium growth and investment yield assumptions as these items are the key drivers of future taxable profits.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the controlled entity is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset in the consolidated financial statements when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority.",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n## 7. 2 Intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nIntangible assets are assets with no physical substance. The most significant classes of intangible assets are detailed below:\n\n## Lloyd's syndicate capacity\n\nThe Lloyd's syndicate capacity intangible asset relates to the syndicate capacity acquired as part of the acquisition of QBE Underwriting Limited (formerly trading as Limit) in 2000 and costs incurred as a result of increasing capacity since that date. Syndicate capacity is the aggregate of the premium limits of each member of that syndicate at a point in time. An existing capital provider has the first right to participate on the next year of account, giving the indefinite right to participate on all future years of account. The Group has demonstrated a long-term commitment to developing its operations at Lloyd's. The value of this asset is in the access it gives to future underwriting profits at Lloyd's. For these reasons, Lloyd's syndicate capacity is deemed to have an indefinite useful life.\n\n## Customer relationships\n\nCustomer relationships comprise the capitalisation of future profits relating to insurance contracts acquired and the expected renewal of those contracts. It also includes the value of distribution networks and agency relationships. Customer relationships are amortised over remaining lives of up to eight years depending on the classes of business to which the assets relate.\n\n## Brand names\n\nThese assets reflect the revenue generating ability of acquired brands. In some circumstances, brand names are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to the long-term nature of the asset.\n\n## Insurance licences\n\nThese assets give the Group the right to operate in certain geographic locations and to write certain classes of business with a potential to generate additional revenue. In some cases, these are considered to have an indefinite useful life due to their long-term nature; however, where there is a finite useful life, assets are amortised over the remaining period, up to 15 years.\n\n## So/f\\_tware\n\nThis includes both acquired and internally developed software which is not integral or closely related to an item of hardware such as an underwriting system. Capitalised software is amortised over periods of up to 10 years, reflecting the period during which the Group is expected to benefit from the use of the software.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and therefore is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually, or more often if there is an indication of impairment.\n\n|                  | IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES           | IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES                  | IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES   | IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES   | IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES   | IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES   |                |             |\n|------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|-------------|\n| 2022             | LLOYD'S  SYNDICATE  CAPACITY  US$M | CUSTOMER  RELATION/hyphen.cap SHIPS  US$M | BRAND  NAMES  US$M         | INSURANCE  LICENCES  US$M  | SOFTWARE  US$M             | OTHER  US$M                | GOODWILL  US$M | TOTAL  US$M |\n| Cost             |                                    |                                           |                            |                            |                            |                            |                |             |\n| At 1 January     | 86                                 | 454                                       | 26                         | 139                        | 492                        | 19                         | 2,016          | 3,232       |\n| Additions        | -                                  | -                                         | -                          | -                          | 132                        | -                          | -              | 132         |\n| Impairment       | -                                  | -                                         | -                          | -                          | (11)                       | -                          | -              | (11)        |\n| Disposals        | -                                  | (57)                                      | -                          | -                          | (119)                      | (9)                        | (328)          | (513)       |\n| Foreign exchange | (10)                               | (7)                                       | (1)                        | (7)                        | (31)                       | -                          | (110)          | (166)       |\n| At 31 December   | 76                                 | 390                                       | 25                         | 132                        | 463                        | 10                         | 1,578          | 2,674       |\n| Amortisation     |                                    |                                           |                            |                            |                            |                            |                |             |\n| At 1 January     | -                                  | (426)                                     | (22)                       | (77)                       | (239)                      | (19)                       | -              | (783)       |\n| Amortisation 1   | -                                  | (13)                                      | -                          | (2)                        | (64)                       | -                          | -              | (79)        |\n| Disposals        | -                                  | 56                                        | -                          | -                          | 119                        | 9                          | -              | 184         |\n| Foreign exchange | -                                  | 6                                         | 1                          | 5                          | 10                         | -                          | -              | 22          |\n| At 31 December   | -                                  | (377)                                     | (21)                       | (74)                       | (174)                      | (10)                       | -              | (656)       |\n| Carrying amount  |                                    |                                           |                            |                            |                            |                            |                |             |\n| At 31 December   | 76                                 | 13                                        | 4                          | 58                         | 289                        | -                          | 1,578          | 2,018       |\n\n- 1  Amortisation of $63 million is included in underwriting expenses as it relates to intangible assets integral to the Group's underwriting activities.",

Those with a finite useful life are amortised over their estimated useful life in accordance with the pattern of expected consumption of economic benefits, with amortisation expense reported in underwriting and other expenses or in amortisation and impairment of intangibles depending on the use of the asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indicators of impairment. Intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## 7. 2 . 1 Impairment testing of intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nAn intangible asset's recoverable value is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less cost to sell.\n\nFor intangible assets with a finite life, if there are indicators that the intangible asset's recoverable value has fallen below its carrying value (e.g. due to changing market conditions), an impairment test is performed and a loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the asset's recoverable value.\n\nIntangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are tested annually for impairment or more frequently where there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from synergies arising from the acquisition giving rise to the goodwill. Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units reflect the level at which goodwill is monitored for impairment by QBE. As the Group acquires or disposes of operations or reorganises the way that operations are managed, reporting structures may change, giving rise to a reassessment of cash-generating units and the allocation of goodwill to those cash-generating units.\n\nThe goodwill relating to certain acquisitions is denominated in currencies other than the US dollar and so is subject to foreign exchange movements.\n\nGoodwill is analysed by groups of cash-generating units as follows:\n\n|                   | 2022 US$M   | 2021 US$M   |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| North America     | 30          | 358         |\n| International     | 490         | 524         |\n| Australia Pacific | 1,058       | 1,134       |\n|                   | 1,578       | 2,016       |\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n6",

GROUP STRUCTURE\n\n## Impairment losses\n\nDuring 2022, software assets of $11 million were impaired following management's review of their recoverable amounts. During 2021, insurance licences of $2 million were impaired.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\n## Impairment testing of identi/fiable intangible assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of each intangible asset with an indefinite useful life has been determined by reference to a value in use calculation based on the following key assumptions and estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash flow forecasts relevant to the initial valuation of the identifiable intangible asset are reviewed and updated (if appropriate). Cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of actual performance to date and expectations of future performance based on prevailing and anticipated market factors.\n- \u00b7 Discount rates include a beta and a market risk premium sourced from observable market information, and a specific risk premium appropriate to reflect the nature of the risk associated with the intangible asset or the cash-generating unit to which the asset is allocated.\n\n## Impairment testing of goodwill\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units has been determined by reference to a value in use calculation based on the following key assumptions and estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash flow forecasts reflect combined operating ratio and investment return assumptions that build from the latest three-year business plan. These forecasts cover a period of five years, with the final two years determined with reference to the terminal growth rates discussed below. The cash flow forecasts are based on a combination of historical performance and expectations of future performance based on prevailing and anticipated market factors and the benefit of committed cost saving measures.\n- \u00b7 Terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity growth formula from the end of the cash flow forecast period. Growth rates reflect the long-term average growth rates of the countries relevant to the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units and are based on observable market information. The terminal growth rates used in impairment testing are: North America 2.3% (2021 2.3%), Australia Pacific 2.5% (2021 2.5%) and International 2.0% (2021 2.0%).\n- \u00b7 Discount rates reflect a beta and a market risk premium sourced from observable market information, and a specific risk premium appropriate to reflect the nature of the business of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rates used were: North America 12.7% (2021 9.7%), Australia Pacific 14.0% (2021 12.8%) and International 10.8% (2021 8.9%). The post-tax discount rates used were: North America 9.9% (2021 7.6%), Australia Pacific 9.9% (2021 9.1%) and International 8.6% (2021 7.2%).\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group's business plan, which is the basis for cash flow forecasts used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill, considers the potential impact of climate change through the catastrophe allowance which reflects the anticipated rise in trends in the frequency and cost of weather-related events, as well as other assumptions, including relating to premium rate, which reflect QBE's underwriting strategy and planned management actions in response to these risks.\n\nThe disposal of Westwood Insurance Agency included an allocation of $328 million of goodwill relating to the North American cash-generating unit (refer to note 7.1). Following the disposal, the remaining North America goodwill is $30 million.",

An assessment of the financial impact of the standards and amendments has been undertaken and they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements, except where noted below.\n\n## AASB 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nAASB 17, a new accounting standard for insurance contracts, was adopted by the AASB in July 2017. In June 2020, the IASB issued Amendments to IFRS 17 which deferred the effective date from 1 January 2021 to 1 January 2023 and made significant amendments to the standard in response to feedback from, and implementation issues raised by, stakeholders. These amendments were adopted by the AASB in July 2020.\n\n## Measurement of insurance contracts\n\n## Measurement models\n\nThe standard introduces a new 'general model' for the recognition and measurement of insurance contracts. The liability for remaining coverage (which represents insurance coverage to be provided after the balance date) under the general model is measured as the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the present value of expected future cash flows and a risk adjustment (collectively referred to as the 'fulfilment cash flows'); and\n- \u00b7 a contractual service margin (CSM), being the unearned profit, which is recognised as insurance revenue in profit or loss over the coverage period of the contracts. The CSM is earned based on a pattern of coverage units which may not be the same as the pattern of incidence of risk used to earn gross written premium under AASB 1023.",

    {
        "page_content": "AASB 17 permits the use of a simplified approach referred to as the 'premium allocation approach' (which is similar to the current basis on which general insurance is brought to account under AASB 1023) if the liability for remaining coverage under the premium allocation approach is not expected to materially differ from that under the general model, or if the coverage period of the contracts is not greater than one year. QBE has developed a model and methodology for assessing eligibility of contracts with coverage periods of greater than one year to apply the premium allocation approach. Our assessment, which involved detailed modelling under a range of scenarios as well as a qualitative assessment of contract features, has determined that the premium allocation approach is expected to apply to the vast majority of the Group's business.\n\nFor groups of contracts that apply the premium allocation approach and have a coverage period of one year or less, AASB 17 provides an option to recognise any insurance acquisition costs as expenses when incurred. QBE does not plan to apply this option and expects to amortise acquisition costs over the coverage period of the related insurance contracts, consistent with current accounting under AASB 1023.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nAASB 17 requires the identification of 'groups' of onerous contracts which will be determined at a more granular level of aggregation than the level at which the liability adequacy test is performed under AASB 1023. Contracts that are measured using the premium allocation approach are assumed not to be onerous unless facts and circumstances indicate otherwise. QBE has developed a framework for identifying relevant facts and circumstances that may be indicators of possible onerous contracts which includes consideration of management information for Group planning and performance management.\n\nIf facts and circumstances that may be indicators of possible onerous contracts exist, the onerous contract losses are measured based on an estimation of fulfilment cash flows and are recognised in profit or loss. Onerous contract losses must be measured on a gross basis (excluding the effect of reinsurance), with the impact on equity and profit or loss mitigated by related income on reinsurance recoveries to the extent that the onerous contracts are covered by reinsurance. In isolation, the application of the onerous contracts requirements is expected to result in a decrease in opening equity on adoption of AASB 17.\n\n## Risk adjustment\n\nThe measurement of insurance contract liabilities will include a risk adjustment which replaces the risk margin under AASB 1023. The risk margin under AASB 1023 reflects the inherent uncertainty in the net discounted central estimate, whereas the risk adjustment under AASB 17 is defined as the compensation required for bearing the uncertainty that arises from non-financial risk. The Group intends to apply a cost of capital approach as a key input to determining the risk adjustment for both the liability for incurred claims and the liability for remaining coverage. When applying the premium allocation approach, no explicit risk adjustment is determined for the liability for remaining coverage, except when measuring onerous contracts.\n\nThe Group expects to adopt an AASB 17 risk adjustment from a target range (expressed as a percentage of expected future cash flows which are equivalent to the AASB 1023 central estimate), a range that is expected to be slightly lower than the equivalent AASB 1023 risk margin range. Similar to the risk margin, the risk adjustment includes the benefit of diversification. AASB 17 requires the disclosure of the confidence level that corresponds to the risk adjustment used in the measurement of insurance contract liabilities.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nAASB 1023 requires the net central estimate of outstanding claims to be discounted using risk-free rates as described in note 2.3.4. AASB 17 requires estimates of future cash flows to be discounted to reflect the time value of money and financial risks related to those cash flows but does not prescribe a methodology for determining the discount rates used. QBE will apply a 'bottom-up approach' which requires the use of risk-free rates adjusted to reflect the illiquidity characteristics of the insurance contracts, which will result in higher discount rates relative to current requirements and an increase in opening equity on adoption of AASB 17. The illiquidity premium within discount rates will be derived based on the long-term weighted average credit spread of a reference portfolio of assets with a similar currency mix and weighted average duration as the related insurance liabilities over the longer term. The effect of credit risk and other factors that are not relevant to the illiquidity characteristics of insurance contracts will be eliminated to estimate the portion of the spread that reflects the illiquidity premium.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nInsurance contract assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currency are treated as monetary items under AASB 17. This differs from current industry practice in respect of unearned premium and deferred insurance costs which are treated as non-monetary items. Based on the exchange rates at the transition date, the impact of this change on opening equity is not expected to be material. The resulting exposures from the change in treatment will be mitigated going forward as part of the Group's operational currency risk management strategy, with new forward foreign exchange contracts entered into at 31 December 2022 to mitigate these exposures from 2023.\n\n## Interim reporting\n\nQBE expects to apply the option to measure accounting estimates based on assumptions relevant at each reporting date. This means that estimates made in interim financial statements will be updated in the subsequent annual financial statements where required.\n\n## Presentation and disclosure\n\nThe standard introduces changes to the presentation and disclosure of insurance line items in the financial statements, introducing new line items on the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet and increased disclosures compared with existing reporting requirements.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

OTHER\n\nExisting insurance and reinsurance contract line items on the balance sheet (including trade debtors arising from general insurance contracts, unearned premium, deferred insurance costs, gross outstanding claims and reinsurance and other recoveries on outstanding claims) will be replaced by insurance contract assets and liabilities, and reinsurance contract assets and liabilities. Insurance contract liabilities under AASB 17 will include all cash flows that directly relate to the fulfilment of insurance contracts (direct business and inward reinsurance), including acquisition, claims settlement, policy administration and maintenance costs. It also includes other costs such as direct overheads which are currently recognised in trade and other payables on the balance sheet.\n\n## Transition\n\nAASB 17 will be applied retrospectively to all of QBE's insurance contracts on transition except to the extent that it is impracticable to do so, in which case either a modified retrospective or fair value approach may be applied. QBE will apply a modified retrospective approach for the following:\n\n- \u00b7 certain contracts acquired in the past (e.g. as part of a business combination) that, at the time of acquisition, were considered past expiry and were in their claims settlement period. For these contracts, the related liabilities are expected to be classified as liabilities for incurred claims, on the basis that it would be impracticable to treat these liabilities as related to unexpired coverage; and\n- \u00b7 determination of the CSM for contracts measured under the general model, for which sufficient data on historical assumptions is not available for the estimation of future cash flows and risk adjustment at initial recognition as well as the amount of CSM earned to profit or loss up to the transition date, which are key inputs. To the extent that this information is not available without the use of hindsight, permitted modifications in AASB 17 will be applied to estimate these amounts based on transition date expectations about changes that occurred between initial recognition and the transition date.\n- \u00b7 identification of groups of onerous contracts relating to past underwriting years. These have been assessed based on information available at the transition date to the extent that reasonable and supportable information about past facts and circumstances is not available without the use of hindsight.\n\n## Financial impact\n\nBased on the above and work performed to date, the impact of AASB 17 adoption on the Group's reported net assets of $8,882 million as at 1 January 2022 is currently expected to be modest and within a range of a $50 million decrease to a $150 million increase, or less than 2% of net assets, before associated tax effects. The opening net asset impact is mainly driven by increases to net assets from the application of the AASB 17 risk adjustment and higher discount rates reflecting the inclusion of the illiquidity premium, offset by decreases to net assets driven by onerous contracts and the impact of changes in the pattern of revenue recognition for certain classes of business (largely resulting from the application of the general model). The requirements of AASB 17 are complex and the actual impact is subject to the finalisation of key assumptions in relation to each of these components.\n\nThe Group's implementation of AASB 17 is well progressed and work is ongoing to finalise the impacts and to restate comparative information for reporting on this basis in 2023.",

If the expected settlement of the liability becomes probable, a provision is recognised.\n\nQBE is required to support the underwriting activities of the Group's controlled entities including corporate members at Lloyd's. Funds at Lloyd's are those funds of the Group which are subject to the terms of the Lloyd's Deposit Trust Deed and are required to support underwriting for the following year and the open years of account, determined by a formula prescribed by Lloyd's each year. At the balance date, letters of credit and similar forms of support of $2,330 million (2021 $2,177 million) were in place in respect of the Group's participation in Lloyd's, along with cash and investments of $89 million (2021 $106 million). In addition, a controlled entity has entered into various trust and security deeds with Lloyd's in respect of assets lodged to support its underwriting activities. These deeds contain covenants that require the entity to meet financial obligations should they arise in relation to cash calls from syndicate participations. A cash call would be made first on the assets held in syndicate trust funds and would only call on funds at Lloyd's after syndicate resources were exhausted. Only if the level of these trust funds was not sufficient would a cash call result in a draw down on the letters of credit and other assets lodged with Lloyd's.\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group is also exposed to contingent liabilities in relation to claims litigation and regulatory examinations arising out of its insurance and reinsurance activities. The Group may also be exposed to the possibility of contingent liabilities in relation to insurance and non-insurance litigation including but not limited to regulatory test cases and class actions, taxation and compliance matters, which may result in legal or regulatory penalties and financial or non-financial losses and other impacts. QBE is currently defending a representative class action in Australia relating to policyholders with business interruption policies.\n\nEntities in the Group may also provide guarantees to support representations in commercial transactions.\n\n## 8.3 Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group has $228 million (2021 $243 million) receivable from and payable to a single counterparty which are fully set off in the balance sheet in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, on the basis that the Group intends to settle these on a net basis and has a legally enforceable right to do so.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

Some of the assumptions used may be based on historical data which is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Reasonable changes in these assumptions would not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## 8.5.4 Employee options\n\nThe market value of all shares underlying the options at the balance date was A$0.2 million (2021 A$0.2 million). During 2022, no options (2021 nil) were cancelled or forfeited. At 31 December 2022, 17,000 remained, excluding notional dividends (2021 17,000). The options were issued to employees in 2004 in lieu of shares under the Plan. The options vested immediately and are exercisable until March 2024.\n\n## 8.5.5 Share-based payment expense\n\nThis expense, which includes amounts in relation to cash-settled share-based payment awards, was $44 million (2021 $36 million). These amounts are included in underwriting and other expenses.\n\n## 8.5.6 Shares purchased on-market\n\nThe Group may purchase shares on-market to satisfy entitlements under employee share schemes. The Group acquired 0.1 million (2021 0.1 million) such shares during the period at an average price of A$11.78 (2021 A$11.07).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of equity-settled instruments is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the instruments granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The impacts of non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable.\n\nThe fair value of each instrument is recognised evenly over the service period ending at the vesting date; however, at each balance date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to become exercisable due to the achievement of non-market vesting conditions. The Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in profit or loss with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n6",

Bonus or profit sharing obligations are settled within 12 months from the balance date.\n\n## Post-employment bene/fits - de/fined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an entity pays a fixed contribution into a fund during the course of employment and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Other long-term employee employment bene/fits\n\nThe liabilities for long service leave and annual leave are recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period using the projected unit credit method. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using high quality corporate bond yields with terms and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Remeasurements as a result of experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nFurther information in relation to remuneration under equity-based compensation schemes is provided in note 8.5.\n\n## Termination bene/fits\n\nTermination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. When applicable, the Group recognises termination benefits at the earlier of the date when the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 can no longer withdraw the offer of those benefits; and\n- \u00b7 recognises costs for a restructuring that is within the scope of AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and involves the payment of termination benefits.\n\nIn the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, the termination benefits are measured based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period are discounted to present value.",

If actual outcomes differ materially from actuarial assumptions, this could result in a significant change in employee benefit expense recognised in profit or loss or in actuarial remeasurements recognised in other comprehensive income, together with the defined benefit assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet.\n\nThe Group does not control the investment strategies of defined benefit plans; they are managed by independent trustees. Nonetheless, the Group has agreed, as part of ongoing funding arrangements, that the trustees should manage their strategic asset allocation in order to minimise the risk of material adverse impact. In particular, the Group has agreed with the trustees to reduce the level of investment risk by investing in assets that match, where possible, the profile of the liabilities. This involves holding a mixture of government and corporate bonds. The Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the plan liabilities, a level of continuing equity investment is also appropriate.\n\nThe charge recognised in profit or loss in the year of $2 million (2021 $2 million) is included in underwriting expenses. Total employer contributions expected to be paid to the various plans in 2023 amount to $1 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we account for the numbers\n\nThe surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate or government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have a term to maturity approximating the term of the related superannuation liability. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, and are recognised in other comprehensive income. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n6",

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Financial Report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the Financial Report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n- \u00b7 For the purpose of our audit we used overall Group materiality of US$70 million, which represents approximately 0.5% of the Group's net earned premium.\n- \u00b7 We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the Financial Report as a whole.\n- \u00b7 We chose Group net earned premium because, in our view, it is a key financial statement metric used in assessing the performance of the Group and is not as volatile as other profit or loss measures.\n- \u00b7 We utilised a 0.5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds.\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- \u00b7 Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n- \u00b7 In conjunction with component auditors, we conducted an audit of the most financially significant components, being the Australia Pacific, International and North America divisions. In addition, we performed specified risk focused audit procedures in relation to the captive reinsurer, Equator Re, and other head office entities. Further audit procedures were performed over the consolidation process.\n- \u00b7 We determined the level of direction and supervision we needed to have over the audit work performed by component auditors to be satisfied that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained for the purposes of our opinion.\n- \u00b7 We kept in regular communication with component auditors throughout the year with conference calls and written instructions. Further, we visited and met with management and component auditors in London and Sydney.\n- \u00b7 We also ensured that our team, including the component auditors across the Group, possessed the appropriate competence and capabilities needed for the audit of a complex global insurer. This included industry expertise as well as specialists and experts in IT, actuarial, tax and valuations.",

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of net outstanding claims liability\n\n(Refer to note 2.3) US$17,428 million\n\nThe liability for outstanding claims relates to claims incurred during the year or prior periods, net of any reinsurance and other recoveries.\n\nThe liability for outstanding claims is estimated by the Group as a central estimate but, as is the case with any accounting estimate, there is a risk that the ultimate claims paid will differ from the initial estimate. A risk margin is therefore applied by the Group to reflect the uncertainty in the estimate. The central estimate and risk margin combined, which are estimated based on judgements and actuarial expertise, are intended to achieve a probability of adequacy within the Group's desired range of 87.5% - 92.5%, being the estimated overall sufficiency of the liability to pay future claims.\n\nWe considered the valuation of the net outstanding claims liability a key audit matter due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The significant judgement required by the Group and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the expected future payments for claims incurred, including those not yet reported.\n- \u00b7 The uncertainty related to catastrophe events, particularly those occurring closer to year end, and in relation to classes of business where there is a greater length of time between the initial claim event and settlement, because of the inherent difficulty in assessing amounts until further evidence is available.\n- \u00b7 The uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic on particular classes of business including property business interruption as a result of ongoing legal test cases and other factors.\n- \u00b7 Models used to calculate the net outstanding claims liability across the Group are complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of the models.\n- \u00b7 The higher degree of auditor judgement and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to significant assumptions, particularly loss ratios, claim frequencies and average claim sizes, and allowance for future claims inflation.\n- \u00b7 The audit effort required the use of experts with specialised skills and knowledge.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nTogether with PwC actuarial experts, our procedures included:\n\n## Gross discounted central estimate\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the design of the Group's relevant controls over the claims reserving process and assessing whether a sample of these controls operated effectively throughout the year.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating whether the Group's actuarial methodologies were consistent with recognised practices and with prior periods.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness and reliability of data used to derive the central estimate, including testing a sample of case estimates and settlements by agreeing to underlying documentation.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the appropriateness of significant actuarial assumptions such as loss ratios, claim frequencies and average claim sizes, and claims inflation expectations, focusing on those classes of business which have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and more recently the higher inflationary environment. We assessed these assumptions by comparing them with our expectations based on the Group's experience, current trends and benchmarks, and our own industry knowledge.\n- \u00b7 Testing the discount assumptions applied through evaluating the yield curves and claims payment patterns. This included comparing the rates applied to external market data and the payment patterns to historical information.\n\n## Reinsurance and other recoveries\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating a sample of reinsurance recoveries held by divisions and the Group against underlying contracts to assess the existence of cover and appropriateness of their recognition.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the recoverability of reinsurance recoveries by considering the payment history and credit worthiness of reinsurer counterparties for a sample of reinsurance recoveries.\n\n1\n\nP\n\no\n\ne\n\nv\n\ne\n\nrf\n\no\n\nrvi\n\ne\n\nw\n\nrm\n\nan\n\nc\n\ne\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6",

The value-in-use for each of the CGUs is estimated by the Group using a discounted cash flow model which includes significant judgements and assumptions relating to cash flow projections, investment returns, terminal growth rates and discount rates.\n\nWe considered the carrying value of goodwill a key audit matter due to:\n\n- \u00b7 The inherent estimation uncertainty and subjectivity in judgements in a number of assumptions, including cash flow projections, investment returns, terminal growth rates, and discount rates.\n- \u00b7 Models used to calculate value-in-use are complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of the models.\n- \u00b7 The higher degree of auditor judgement and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in relation to significant assumptions, particularly cash flow projections.\n- \u00b7 The audit effort required the use of experts with specialised skills and knowledge.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Risk margin and probability of adequacy\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing the Group's approach to setting the risk margin in accordance with the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, with a focus on the assessed level of uncertainty in the net central estimate leading to a change in the margin year on year.\n- \u00b7 Considering the Group's key judgements about the variability of each class of business underwritten and the extent of correlation within each division based on the Group's experience and prior periods.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the Group's calculation of the probability of adequacy for reasonableness and consistency with previous valuations by developing an understanding of and testing the actuarial techniques applied by the Group.\n\nWe also considered the appropriateness of the Group's disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the determination and composition of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the value-in-use methodology adopted against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n- \u00b7 Developing an understanding of the process by which the cash flow projections were developed and comparing the cash flows included in the impairment assessment with the three year business plan presented to the Board.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of significant assumptions used to derive the cash flow projections by comparing to external market and industry data where available, and current and past performance of the CGUs.\n- \u00b7 Together with PwC valuation experts, we:\n- - Assessed the consistency of the terminal growth rates and investment returns with available external information.\n- - Reperformed the calculation of the discount rates applied to cash flow projections, comparing key inputs (including risk-free rates, market premiums and unlevered betas) to industry and other benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models which were used to determine the value-in-use of the CGUs.\n\nWe also considered the appropriateness of the Group's disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.",

The website also offers regular QBE share price updates, a calendar of events, a history of QBE's dividends and online access to your shareholding details via the share registry.\n\n## Shareholder information and enquiries\n\nEnquiries and correspondence regarding shareholdings can be directed to QBE's share registry:\n\nComputershare Investor Services Pty Limited (Computershare)\n\nGPO Box 2975\n\nMelbourne VIC 3001 Australia\n\n452 Johnston Street Abbotsford VIC 3067 Australia\n\nTelephone: 1300 723 487 (Australia)\n\nTelephone: +61 3 9415 4840 (International)\n\nWebsite: www.computershare.com.au\n\nEmail: qbe.queries@computershare.com.au\n\nFor security purposes, you will need to quote your Securityholder Reference Number (SRN) or Holder Identification Number (HIN).\n\nIf you are broker (CHESS) sponsored, queries relating to incorrect registrations and changes to name and/or address can only be processed by your stockbroker. Please contact your stockbroker. Computershare cannot assist you with these changes.\n\n## Shareholding details online\n\nManage your shareholding online by visiting QBE's share registry, Computershare. Log onto www.investorcentre.com to view your holding balance and dividend statements, to update your address (if you are registered with an SRN) or direct credit instructions, provide DRP or BSP instructions or change/add your tax file number (TFN)/Australian Business Number (ABN) details.\n\nYou may also register to receive shareholder documentation electronically including your dividend statements, notices of meetings and proxy and annual reports.\n\n## Privacy legislation\n\nChapter 2C of the Corporations Act 2001 requires information about you as a securityholder (including your name, address and details of the securities you hold) to be included in QBE's share register. These details must continue to be included in the public register even if you cease to be a securityholder. A copy of the privacy policy is available on Computershare's website.\n\n## Dividends\n\nQBE pays cash dividends to shareholders resident in Australia and New Zealand by direct credit. Shareholders in the United Kingdom and the United States also have the option to receive their cash dividends by direct credit, although it is not mandatory. The benefit to shareholders of the direct credit facility is access to cleared funds quickly and securely, reducing the risk of cheques being lost or stolen. Shareholders in other countries will receive cheque payments in Australian dollars if they have not elected to receive their payment by direct credit. Shareholders receive a dividend statement for tax records, either by post or by email depending on the selected communications option.\n\nEligible shareholders can participate in QBE's DRP and BSP when the plans are active. The DRP enables shareholders to subscribe for additional shares. The BSP is a bonus share plan whereby the dividend entitlement is forgone for bonus shares in lieu of the dividend. In order to participate in either the DRP or BSP, shareholders must have a minimum shareholding of 100 shares and have a registered address in Australia or New Zealand.\n\nParticipants may change their election to participate in the DRP and BSP at any time. DRP/BSP election cut-off dates and application forms are available from QBE's website.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6",

If you choose not to lodge these details, QBE is obliged to deduct tax at the highest marginal rate (plus the Medicare levy) from the unfranked portion of dividends paid. Australian shareholders living abroad should advise Computershare of their resident status.\n\n## Conduit foreign income (CFI)\n\nShareholders will receive CFI credits in respect of the whole unfranked portion of QBE dividends. These credits exempt non-resident shareholders from Australian withholding tax.\n\n## Unpresented cheques/unclaimed money\n\nUnder the Unclaimed Moneys Act 1950 , unclaimed dividends six or more years old must be given to the Australian Capital Territory. It is very important that shareholders bank outstanding dividend cheques promptly and advise Computershare immediately of changes of address or bank account details.\n\n## Recent QBE dividends\n\nAUSTRALIAN\n\n| DATE PAID         | TYPE    | RECORD DATE      |   CENTS PER SHARE |   FRANKING % |\n|-------------------|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| 28 March 2013     | Final   | 8 March 2013     |                10 |          100 |\n| 23 September 2013 | Interim | 2 September 2013 |                20 |          100 |\n| 31 March 2014     | Final   | 13 March 2014    |                12 |          100 |\n| 23 September 2014 | Interim | 29 August 2014   |                15 |          100 |\n| 13 April 2015     | Final   | 6 March 2015     |                22 |          100 |\n| 2 October 2015    | Interim | 28 August 2015   |                20 |          100 |\n| 14 April 2016     | Final   | 11 March 2016    |                30 |          100 |\n| 28 September 2016 | Interim | 26 August 2016   |                21 |           50 |\n| 13 April 2017     | Final   | 10 March 2017    |                33 |           50 |\n| 29 September 2017 | Interim | 25 August 2017   |                22 |           30 |\n| 20 April 2018     | Final   | 9 March 2018     |                 4 |           30 |\n| 5 October 2018    | Interim | 24 August 2018   |                22 |           30 |\n| 18 April 2019     | Final   | 8 March 2019     |                28 |           60 |\n| 4 October 2019    | Interim | 23 August 2019   |                25 |           60 |\n| 9 April 2020      | Final   | 6 March 2020     |                27 |           30 |\n| 25 September 2020 | Interim | 21 August 2020   |                 4 |           10 |\n| 24 September 2021 | Interim | 20 August 2021   |                11 |           10 |\n| 12 April 2022     | Final   | 8 March 2022     |                19 |           10 |\n| 23 September 2022 | Interim | 19 August 2022   |                 9 |           10 |\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of QBE Insurance Group Limited will be held at 10am on Friday, 12 May 2023.
