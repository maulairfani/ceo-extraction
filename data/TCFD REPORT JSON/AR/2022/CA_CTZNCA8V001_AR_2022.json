        "page_content": "## Message from the Chair.\n\nA transformed economy that protects the earth and guarantees equity for all: that's the North-Star vision towards which your Board is steering Vancity\n\nAnd in a year marked by devastating weather events and deepening economic, social, and political cleavages, the Board remains committed to realizing this vision.\n\nThe Board's governance function has particular importance in times of uncertainty. Vancity's commitment to Reconciliation, justice and equity, and to systemic change provides both an anchor and direction. How Vancity, as your trusted financial institution, works on your behalf - to steward our collective assets, tackle the affordability crisis, and support your needs for sustainable livelihoods and communities - is our key focus.\n\nVancity's strategy has centred on offering you the best possible financial advice so you can better navigate the sudden increase in basic living costs as well as the challenges we're seeing in investment markets. In 2022, we brought on more financial advisors to help members with critical financial decisions.\n\nVancity also continued to work closely with the local businesses at the heart of our communities. Sixty-eight per cent of our procurement spending about $88 million - went to local businesses. We offer financing to help business members reduce their emissions through building retrofits, equipment purchases, clean transportation, and other energy-saving products and technologies. And we are extending our partnership with the Green Business BC certification program, an initiative that certifies and promotes business members that meet environmental standards. We are subsidizing our members' costs of certification, and helping the program expand from Vancouver Island across the province.\n\nVancity's strategy also included ramping up our work in our communities by supporting the development of more affordable housing for both renters and owners, and by partnering with climate experts to offer our members insights on housing retrofits. Importantly, Vancity returns 30 per cent of our net profits to members and local change organizations that are working to strengthen financial health, equity, climate resilience, and climate justice.\n\n'At the heart of Vancity's peoplecentred commitment to economic transformation is our identity as a co-operative.'\n\nAs Vancity's vision demands, our strategy must support economic development that protects the planet. Thus, we were the first financial institution in Canada to announce our aim to bring the greenhouse gas emissions we finance through our loans and mortgages to net zero by 2040. In 2022, that meant supporting and investing in businesses that are not just climate resilient, but also actively competitive in the green economy. It also meant centring the realities and needs of the most vulnerable in our communities as we work towards cutting our greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. That meant recognizing how historic and entrenched economic, racial, and gender inequities make mitigating, adapting, and responding to climate impacts much harder. Vancity's strategy is to create paths so that every one of us can be part of the transition.\n\nAt the heart of Vancity's people-centred commitment to economic transformation is our identity as a co-operative. The co-operative model is old, but it nonetheless continues to present among the most disruptive economic alternatives available. This model insists that your financial institution maximizes value to you, rather than profits to faraway shareholders. It focuses our attention on the communities in which we live and work, and on leveraging opportunities to strengthen these communities. And it directs a spotlight towards the larger co-operative ecosystem. In 2022, we contributed $1.2 million to strengthen co-operatives, including the BC Co-op Association and the Canadian Worker Co-op Federation. Playing a greater role in realizing the transformative potential of co-operatives is a major Board priority for 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur vision is a hopeful one. And one that is possible. The Board remains committed to ensuring that Vancity works on your behalf towards the clean and fair world we all deserve - and need.\n\nRita Parikh Chair, Vancity Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Message from the CEO.\n\n2022 was a year no one had anticipated. The global disruption of supply chains and stock-market volatility that began during the pandemic were made much worse by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Combined with the ongoing impacts of the climate crisis, such as the impact of extreme weather events on the supply of produce and agricultural products, this resulted in surprisingly rapid inflation, recessionary pressures, and aggressive interest rate increases.\n\nMembers acutely felt these economic trends, especially in the second half of the year. Grocery bills rose, our dollars stretched less, and for many people, financial choices became more challenging. Most of us felt the stress of living through volatility and change.\n\nAt Vancity, while we carried much of our remarkable 2021 performance into 2022, market conditions slowed our performance as the year progressed. We still had a strong year in many respects, for example, finishing ahead of our targets for operating earnings and net lending growth. But we also needed to recalibrate and adjust.\n\nThe good thing is that we've been in unpredictable operating environments before and have navigated them successfully. The same principles and strategic planning that helped deliver our 2021 results especially putting members and communities, and our values, at the centre of our work - continued to guide us through the year.\n\nWe took a measured business approach with our key performance targets, prepared for more unusual scenarios, and built in both buffers to absorb financial shocks and flexibility to adjust. For example, we increased our reserves to protect against an uncertain future.\n\nWe also shifted resources to enhance our support of members and communities through times of uncertainty. We invested in our employees' ability to advise members and identify solutions for their financial needs. And we trained more than 80 employees to be Wealth Relationship Managers, enabling them to provide members with basic financial planning and investment solutions.\n\nWe are continuing to develop innovative new products, or upgrading existing ones, to better fit members' evolving needs, with a lot of this work driven by affordability and equity as core elements of the transition to a net-zero economy. For example, members can now receive free expert\n\n'One of my proudest moments in 2022 came when we were named in the Globe and Mail as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers.'\n\nhome energy advice and rebates for EnerGuide assessments, in addition to Planet-Wise TM loans for many projects. Non-profit housing providers who are members now have access to specialized grants focused on emissions-reducing retrofits. And in January 2023, we became the first in Canada to introduce a feature to our credit cards that estimates the carbon footprint of purchases.\n\nWe also strengthened our investment in the resilience of our communities. Some examples include our strong investment in affordable housing and banking support for displaced Ukrainian refugees. We continued to deepen our Reconciliation work and Indigenous partnerships, which will be helped immensely by the Progressive Aboriginal Relations TM (PAR) certification program we committed to in 2022.\n\nOur employees remain a priority, and one of my proudest moments in 2022 came when we were named in the Globe and Mail as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers. Our commitment to empowering employees and our support of employees' mental health, in particular, have recently been spotlighted by media. I am thankful to our employees who continue to serve our members and communities with a full and compassionate heart.\n\nAs we move through 2023, we expect unpredictability and unfavourable market conditions to persist, at least initially. But we will continue to navigate these waters with members and communities as our compass. Because, as a co-operative, this is what we do. But also because as Board Chair Rita Parikh says in her report - our values-based and people-centred approach is purpose-built for the times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis distinct approach is what makes us different from other financial institutions. Like other financial institutions, we'll continue monitoring longer-term drivers to be as prepared as we can for whatever financial changes may come. But we'll also continue to be our members' best financial partners, work hard to understand and respond to their needs and challenges, offer innovative products, and constantly improve the experience of banking with us. And we'll continue to invest in enabling and empowering our employees to do all this and serve members as best they can.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristine Bergeron President and CEO",

        "page_content": "## Operating context and strategic priorities.\n\nAmid uncertainty brought on by the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we set Vancity on a new course with a refreshed strategy in 2020. Although the world didn't unfold quite as we expected, we've delivered excellent results so far and there's still a lot to do.\n\nOur members, communities, employees, and industry face new uncertainties that continue to spark challenges like inflation, rapidly rising interest rates, and slow economic growth. Changes to how we work, shop, and bank were accelerated by the effects of the pandemic. And we're already seeing the effects of a changing climate.\n\nIn times like these, many people are asking: How do I pay for my daily needs? How can I afford to invest for my future? Will there be a recession? And\u2026 does my financial institution have my back? Helping our members navigate unpredictable, challenging times is what we do, and it's at the heart of Vancity.\n\nAs we were planning for 2022, we adjusted operations, implemented new policies to protect members and employees, and prepared for different operating environments. Much of the momentum that helped Vancity achieve record results in 2021 carried into 2022, as we saw an unexpected continuation of high demand for loans as members continued to take advantage of low interest rates.\n\nConditions, indeed, changed abruptly in the middle of 2022. Rising rates and inflation changed the economic outlook for our members and our organization as demand for lending fell, investment balances retreated, and costs rose. Although we had\n\nbeen expecting to see these pressures during 2022, we didn't anticipate how fast they would arrive nor how severe they would be.\n\nOur work to strengthen Vancity has helped position us to be more resilient so that we can continue to support our members through good and bad times. Our plans and actions will continue to be guided by a clear strategy anchored in our values, vision, and the needs of our members, communities, and employees. As we look ahead to 2023, our goals remain the same:\n\n- \u00b7  Delivering what our members need, when and where they need it, to become the financial institution our members love to bank with and their best financial partner\n- \u00b7  Driving meaningful social and systemic change to build a clean and fair world and demonstrate that a financial institution can be an agent of positive change\n- \u00b7  Creating an internal culture that values purpose and performance through a diversity, equity, and inclusion lens to become the organization people love to work at and a leading employer\n- \u00b7  Delivering strong, stable financial performance to support investments in our future and to ensure our credit union remains financially strong so we can make a greater impact in our communities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These are our five climate commitments.\n\n## Net zero by 2040\n\nOur ambition is to make Vancity net zero by 2040 across all our mortgages and loans. That means the carbon emitted from anything we finance will be eliminated or significantly reduced, with any remaining emissions being brought to net zero. In late 2021, upon joining the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Vancity Investment Management took a further step and committed to achieving net zero by 2050 across the investment portfolios it manages. See Financed emissions on page 19 , and our Climate Report.\n\n## Financing an equitable climate transition\n\nUnaddressed, climate change will change how we work and live, and will drive further inequality. We will focus our work in financial and social inclusion to provide banking and other solutions to help people who are affected by the climate emergency, as well as those seeking support in transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable living. See Financial health and inclusion, page 14 .\n\n## Investing in a better future\n\nWe will help our members invest for the future we need by offering responsible investment options that can demonstrate the integrity of their environmental, social and governance (ESG) screening and stewardship process. See Responsible investment, page 22 .\n\n## Be transparent and accountable\n\nEncouraging change within the financial services sector by accurately measuring and openly reporting on how our own actions are improving the wellbeing of people, communities and the environment. We aim to continue implementing, testing and helping improve emerging international standards for climate and impact reporting. See About this report, page 41 .\n\n## Walk the talk in all we do\n\nWe're living our values in our daily decision-making in order to serve the diverse needs of our members, employees and communities. We will do our part across our operations to contribute to a just climate transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The PCAF Standard requires an attribution factor to be calculated using a loan-to-value ratio based on the property value at the time of loan origination consistently over the life of the loan. Due to data limitations, we are currently unable to obtain a consistent, historic property value to calculate the loan-to-value attribution factor and therefore apply the most recent property value available which may impact comparability year-over-year. Further note that this percentage change was calculated based on updated estimates of financed emissions, while financed emissions used for target setting were based on earlier estimates of financed emissions. See pages 19 and 24 of the Climate Report for details.\n- 8  Waste sources were expanded in 2022 to include electronic, construction and furniture waste. Historic data is no longer comparable as it only included waste generated on premises.\n- 9  The reporting period (October to September) was changed to align with our fiscal year (January to December). Historic data is not directly comparable.",

Key outages (including a nationwide telecommunications outage which affected members' ability to conduct online banking), member frustration with our banking app, and wait times, all influenced member satisfaction in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, 48 per cent of members were very satisfied (rating us 9 or 10 out of 10) with our overall service delivery, a strong rating by industry standards, but still a decrease from 2021 and below our 2022 target. Our average member satisfaction score in 2022 was 8.1 out of 10 (81 per cent), a good level of overall member satisfaction. With the average member satisfaction score representing a better reflection of what all members think of our service, we're setting our member satisfaction targets going forward using this measure.\n\nWe opened a new branch in North Vancouver on Lonsdale in January 2023. Vancity regularly reviews our branch network, and we open and close branches based on our members' evolving needs and preferences, and the changing profile of each neighbourhood's population.\n\n## Satisfaction with overall service delivery\n\n(9s and 10s out of 10)\n\nWe began introducing our newly rebranded enviro \u2122 Visa * credit cards in 2022. They are made of recycled PVC plastic and include high contrast numbers for quick readability.\n\nSome areas of our digital experience are not as advanced as we and our members would like. In 2022, we continued to enhance and modernize security and flexibility in our technology foundation. We introduced Google Pay, and plan to focus on improvements to our mobile app and desktop banking, the account opening process, and other key processes to improve members' experience interacting with us.\n\nOpen banking provides a way to exchange data that would allow members to share their financial information safely with third parties. Once introduced by the Government of Canada, it should make it easier to securely share financial information and allow members to choose the best financial services for their needs. We're focused on establishing the technological foundation, products, and services to enable our members to participate in this new system.\n\n## Satisfaction with overall service delivery\n\n(Average)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  Trademark of Visa Ltd., used under licence.",

This result was negatively impacted by the reintroduction of a process to close dormant memberships, which had been put on pause since 2017 as a result of technical challenges. This process resulted in the one-time closure of 5,824 memberships during the year. Excluding this one-time adjustment, Vancity's membership grew by 7,822 members, or 1.40 per cent in 2022.\n\n## Membership growth\n\n(%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## Number of members\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2023 Target 572,098 2022 Target 569,505   |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| 562,259                                   |\n| 560,261                                   |\n| 550,599                                   |\n| 543,621                                   |\n| 533,936                                   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

As we all do more of our banking online, Vancity continues to work to ensure we offer the digital services members want through a stable and secure technology platform that helps protect members from the latest fraud and privacy threats.\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is an additional layer of security that helps to protect members' accounts from fraud. Since we introduced it in 2021, Vancity members have experienced a decrease in online banking fraud.\n\nIn 2022, to further strengthen our employees' skills to identify and address cyber crime, we enhanced our anti-fraud education that is part of our mandatory compliance training.\n\nWe want to make our community branches as safe and convenient as possible for members. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we've been committed to ensuring Vancity meets or exceeds all provincial regulations and public health guidelines.\n\nWe focus on helping our members navigate unpredictable, challenging times to support their financial resilience. Many members were shouldering a lot of financial stress through the pandemic, and for some, rising rates and persistent inflation resulted in challenging financial situations. In 2022, we reached out to more than 5,000 affected members, providing options for managing their mortgage debt and working through their choices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We committed to identify metrics and set targets by 2023 that make a substantial contribution to financial health and inclusion in our communities. This helps us better track our outcomes using a common standard, and aligns directly with our climate commitment to Financing an equitable climate transition . See the Principles for Responsible Banking Self-Assessment for our progress so far.\n\nWe are committed to removing financial barriers that stem from systemic exclusion and inequalities that affect women, Indigenous, Black and people of colour, newcomers and refugees, 2SLGBTQIA+, and people living with visible and invisible disabilities.\n\nAccess to capital has long been a barrier to growth for entrepreneurs. Through the Black Entrepreneurship Program , we offer term loans and operating loans to Black entrepreneurs and Black-led organizations. Vancity's Unity Women Entrepreneurs Program is designed to meet the unique needs of women and non-binary business owners and operators.\n\nRefugees and newcomers to Canada often experience difficulties in accessing basic banking services. Since 2016, we've had an on-site banking kiosk at the Immigrant Services Society of BC's\n\n(ISSofBC) Welcome Centre in Vancouver. This is a one-stop support centre offering services, including opening bank accounts and providing financial literacy on arrival in Canada.\n\nVancity's Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) provides first-stop access to financial services for newcomers to BC who've been displaced from their homelands due to war or persecution. We most recently leveraged this program, along with our community partners, to assist displaced Ukrainians arriving in BC after the February 2022 Ukraine invasion. In 2022 alone, we opened more than 1,700 RAP accounts, for members coming mostly from Afghanistan, Syria, and Ukraine.\n\n## Financial literacy and advice\n\nWe want to help members increase their financial confidence, which is a key component in the financial health and resilience of our members.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to invest in improving processes and training our employees to provide members with consistent yet personalized advice on financial planning, investment, and business, no matter how members interact with us.\n\nWe've translated financial literacy documents, including Vancity's Banking in Canada guide , into Arabic, Dari, Farsi, Pashto, Russian, and Ukrainian to better serve the members who join Vancity as a part of RAP.\n\nWe launched more self-led financial literacy modules, including some on starting a business .\n\nWe work with local community organizations, like Progressive Intercultural Community Services and Family Services of Greater Vancouver, to deliver financial literacy workshops . We rolled out the Wealth Mindset - Indigenous Financial Resilience program in collaboration with Indigenous Elders, to meet the needs and strengths of Indigenous learners and communities.\n\n## Affordable housing\n\nLack of access to affordable housing is severely affecting people's financial resilience and quality of life.\n\nIn 2022, 3,666 units of affordable housing were constructed or renovated with financing from Vancity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, Vancity announced a new Non-Profit Housing Retrofit Program , committing five million dollars in grant funding over the next three years to support low-carbon retrofits of non-profit and co-operative housing.\n\nIn partnership with the Vancity Community Foundation, the Vancity Affordable Housing Accelerator Fund has provided low-cost and flexible loans to support capital needs in the pre-development phase of affordable housing development projects. Since 2011, the Fund has supported the creation of 4,407 affordable rental homes and provided $31.7 million in 81 loans to community organizations needing capital to develop affordable housing. In 2022, responsibility for delivery of the program began moving to the Foundation.\n\nVCIB provides financing for commercial real estate developers that are committed to building affordable and sustainable communities across Canada. For details, see Social purpose real estate financing .\n\n## Number of affordable housing units constructed or renovated with financing from Vancity 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  Counts acquisitions and renovations of homes that already existed, as well as net new homes.",

We're committed to being an anti-racist organization. That means doing our part in removing financial barriers that stem from systemic exclusion and inequities that affect women, Indigenous, Black and people of colour, 2SLGBTQIA+, and people living with visible and invisible disabilities.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to implement recommendations received in 2021 from our external racial equity audit. For example, we:\n\n- \u00b7  Updated our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy to fully integrate our commitments to the BlackNorth Initiative, community investment strategy, mental health strategy, and Indigenous banking strategy\n- \u00b7  Created a continuously open job posting to provide equal employment opportunities to Indigenous applicants after we obtained permission from the BC Human Rights Commissioner to prioritize hiring of Indigenous people without legal backlash from people with non-Indigenous identities\n- \u00b7  Implemented an internal anti-racism audit of the Vancity Board and training to mitigate unconscious bias in the nominations and elections process\n- \u00b7  Reviewed our granting processes and practices to uncover bias and improve access\n- \u00b7  Engaged with our Employee Resource Groups to ensure our efforts are informed by people with lived experience of discrimination\n\nFor a diversity breakdown of our employees and Board, see the Accountability Statements, pages 12 and 35.\n\nSee our website for more on Vancity's work on inclusion and anti-racism .\n\n## Honouring Indigenous employees.\n\nIn 2022, twenty-three employees were blanketed in our first ceremony to honour the Indigenous employees of Vancity. This initiative was led and delivered by Indigenous employees in partnership with the Skwxw\u00fa7mesh \u00daxwumixw (Squamish Nation) and took place at Xwemelch'stn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## People:\n\n## Employees.\n\nThere was a two to three per cent decline in employee engagement across North America in 2022, returning average scores to pre-pandemic levels. Our engagement score was well above the average, and the Globe and Mail named Vancity as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we began transitioning from the Kincentric Employee Engagement survey to the Qualtrics Employee Experience survey. The new approach allows us to dive deeper into how we can continue to improve our employees' experience at Vancity and to better benchmark results.\n\nBeginning in 2023, we're moving away from a static target and instead setting a target for how our score compares to other Canadian organizations. For 2023, our target is to be at the 80th percentile.\n\nIn 2022, Vancity signed the Thrive Global mental health pledge to continue prioritizing the wellbeing and mental health of our employees and maintain our investments and commitments in this critical area. Our management team completed training on supporting their own and their teams' mental health. We plan on expanding this training to all employees beginning in 2023.\n\nTo recognize the increased costs caused by inflation, in July we provided all employees (except for the executive team) with an additional, out-of-cycle three per cent increase to their annual base salaries. We also assigned four Employee Advisors to provide employees with tailored financial advice.\n\nWe redesigned our employee benefits plan to be launched in mid-2023. Employee focus group sessions on health, racial equity, new Canadians, 2SLGBTQIA+, caregivers, people living with disabilities, Indigenous peoples, and women's equity informed its design. Among other changes, it will include significantly expanded mental health coverage and more flexible options for our employees and their families.\n\nWe provide maternity and parental leave top-ups to 85 per cent of salary for both parents. In 2022, we launched a pilot program to support employees transitioning to, during and returning from maternity leave.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2020, we set out to expand access to a definedbenefit pension plan to all eligible Vancity employees. Vancity had long provided retirement benefits to employees with either a defined-benefit pension plan or a Group RRSP, but the goal was to improve the overall retirement plan for all employees by providing a stable and reliable retirement income through a defined-benefit plan. Since then, using employee feedback and working with a team of pension experts, we designed a pension plan that best fits the needs of Vancity employees. It went into effect on January 1, 2023, and we have now enrolled a majority of employees into a defined-benefit pension. Going forward, our goal is for every eligible Vancity employee to be part of the Vancity pension plan.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\n<!-- image -->",

A living wage is different than the minimum wage; it is the hourly rate required for two working parents to meet the basic needs of a family of four. A living wage means stronger local economies, and more sustainable and healthy communities.\n\nIn 2022, Vancity recertified as a Living Wage Employer based on Metro Vancouver's living wage of $20.52/hour. We continue to make living wage adjustments in what we pay our own employees as well as working closely with key suppliers to have their employees who are providing direct services to Vancity paid a living wage. The living wage increased to a minimum of $24.08 per hour in Metro Vancouver in November 2022, effective May 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee page 3 of the Accountability Statements for more information on our People metrics.\n\n| People                                                    | Unit   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Substantiated reports of privacy breaches                 | #      |   80   |   89   |  121   |  106   |   71   |\n| Substantiated incidents of employee fraud                 | #      |    0   |    1   |    4   |    3   |    4   |\n| Employees who self-identify as living with a disability 1 | %      |   16   |   13   |   10   |   10   |   10   |\n| Employees who self-identify as Indigenous 1               | %      |    1.8 |    1.5 |    1.4 |    1.4 |    1.6 |\n| Senior managers who self-identify as women 1              | %      |   53   |   44   |   54   |   51   |   53   |\n| Voluntary turnover rate                                   | %      |    9   |   11   |    6   |    9   |    6   |\n\n- 1  Percentage reflects employees who self-identified in the diversity survey, divided by all employees/senior managers/executive leadership team members. 83 per cent of employees participated in survey.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The climate crisis is a global issue with significant implications for the financial sector, our own operations and business model, and for the people and communities we serve. It requires shifting how we all do business.\n\nThe cost to BC's economy from 2021's unprecedented heat dome, wildfires, floods, and landslides was between $10.6 billion and $17.1 billion, making it the most expensive climate disaster in Canadian history, according to an independent study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives which Vancity funded in 2022. With climate change comes more extreme weather events that not only result in lost lives and damage to property, but also lead to lost income for people due to business closures, lost productivity, and impacts on communities, particularly to the vulnerable and marginalized.\n\nVancity has long recognized the need for urgent action on climate change.

More details are provided in the Climate Report.\n- 2  Per the PCAF Global GHG Standard, a data quality score of 5 is highly estimated/uncertain and a score of 1 signifies certainty (i.e., verified reported emissions).\n- 3  Activities/asset classes are defined according to the PCAF Global GHG Standard and may not align with the terms used in our financial statements. See Climate Report, p. 55 for general exclusions.\n- 4  Our clean energy projects have zero emissions associated with them; therefore, emissions intensity applies to energy efficiency projects only.\n- 5  Third-party data provider tools don't include relevant data for fixed income securities; therefore, we've reported emissions attributed to listed equity and preferred shares only.\n- 6  Emissions reported for the Global Industry Classification Sector (GICs) for Mining only. We plan to report scope 3 emissions for additional sectors in the future.\n- 7  Emissions intensity according to MSCI measure of public equities.\n\n## What net zero by 2040 means for Vancity.\n\nAchieving net zero means eliminating or significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from Vancity's lending, with any remaining emissions being balanced by removing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the air.\n\nIn June 2022, we set interim targets tackling our three largest known emission sources within our lending portfolio:\n\n- \u00b7 Commercial service buildings: 27 per cent emission reduction by 2025 from 2019 level of 23,579 tonnes CO 2 e 1\n- \u00b7 Residential buildings: 17 per cent emission reduction by 2025 from 2019 level of 39,610 tonnes CO 2 e 1\n- \u00b7 Business members: by mid-2023, we'll engage our business members, especially those in our highest greenhouse gas-emitting sectors, around ways to support them in reducing their emissions\n\nFor details, see our Climate Report, page 9.\n\nWe've also set interim climate targets for managed client investments in support of Vancity Investment Management's goal of net zero by 2050.\n\n- 1  Our climate targets cover residential buildings and commercial service buildings. Residential buildings include income-generating residential properties (i.e., residential buildings and units owned by a business), which is in line with the target setting guidance provided by SBTi. In our financed emissions disclosures, income-generating residential properties are included under commercial real estate, in line with the PCAF Global GHG Standard, resulting in 2019 total financed emissions for the commercial real estate asset class of 27,224 tCO 2 e\n- and 39,610 tCO 2 e for residential mortgages.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n20\n\nOur financed emissions data, despite being highly estimated, provides valuable insights into the size and concentration of emissions within our lending and investment portfolios. While many financial institutions must contend with emissions attributed to fossil fuel investments, we don't lend or directly invest in that sector. Most of our lending-related emissions can be attributed to the natural gas used in the buildings and homes we finance. This is where our targets and emission reduction efforts are primarily focused.\n\nTo achieve our net-zero targets, we're focused on:\n\n- \u00b7  Developing products and services for, and engaging with, Vancity members, to support the emissions reductions they want to achieve in their lives and businesses\n- \u00b7  Engaging with officials and policymakers at every level of government to advocate for policies critical to achieving emissions reductions in ways that are affordable, equitable, and improve the wellbeing of people and communities\n- \u00b7  Growing Vancity's lending to lower-emitting assets and businesses\n\nPlease see our Climate Report for more details.\n\nIn addition to financed emissions, we track avoided emissions from clean energy projects. In 2022, these resulted in approximately 5,743 tonnes of avoided emissions, the majority from geothermal, solar, and wind technologies. This is equivalent to removing 1,759 passenger vehicles off the road or eliminating 12,976 barrels of oil, according to National Resources Canada Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator .\n\nPlease read more on our clean energy financing .\n\n## Products and services to address climate change\n\nOur primary avenue for reductions in emissions is in helping and enabling members to take climate action. This includes developing products and services to support members with making retrofitting more affordable and that target replacing gas-powered heating and cooling systems with lower-emitting solutions.\n\nOur Planet-Wise \u2122 products are designed to help members take action in affordable ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Transportation : financing zero- and low-emission transportation, including new or used pedal bikes, e-bikes, scooters, electric cars, hybrids, charging stations, and conversion kits\n- \u00b7 Renovation : financing home energy efficiency improvements and providing support to access assessments, evaluations and rebates\n- \u00b7 Teardown : taking borrowers through the financial and environmental benefits of deconstruction, providing information on tax credits, and working with them to find the best financing option\n- \u00b7 Business : financing for businesses and not-for-profit organizations to undertake building retrofits, equipment purchases, switching to electric vehicles, and other energy-saving technologies\n\nWe launched a support service in 2022 called Home Energy Advice , in partnership with the not-for-profit City Green Solutions. This service helps our members reduce emissions related to their homes by having access to energy expert advice about how they can address both home comfort and emissions.\n\nWe also created a grant program to support non-profit housing providers to plan retrofits of their buildings. Providing safe housing to people who rely on non-profit housing is crucial as we prepare for future extreme climate events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVANCITY STORIES\n\n## Musqueam home retrofit partnership.\n\nClimate-friendly retrofits at on-reserve Musqueam homes advance Reconciliation, equity, and climate action.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We worked with Credential Securities Wealth Advisors on a plan to have all new households they advise placed in responsible investments in 2023.\n\n## Asset management and corporate engagement\n\nVancity, through Vancity Investment Management (VCIM), is a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment and follows the responsible investment (SRI) philosophy. This means we invest in companies committed to using progressive environmental, social, and governance practices to manage their business and avoid those that don't.\n\nAs a sub-advisory group, VCIM provides portfolio management advisory services to IA Clarington on the Inhance SRI Fund family.\n\nVCIM also leads shareholder engagement activities on behalf of both VCIM clients and the IA Clarington Inhance SRI Fund family. In 2022, VCIM engaged with 32 companies on issues including: climate risk, environmental justice, fossil fuel financing, freedom of association, human rights, facial recognition technology, corporate governance, access to medicine, paid sick leave, and biodiversity.\n\nVCIM is a signatory to the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge, committed to collaborating, engaging, assessing its own biodiversity impact, setting targets, and reporting on biodiversity matters by 2024. In 2022, VCIM began engaging with companies on the need to conduct biodiversity assessments in line with the Task Force on Nature-based Financial Disclosures. It also signed the financial sector statement on biodiversity to the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15).\n\n## Impact investments\n\nVancity has allocated $67 million since 2016 to fund our Impact Investment Strategy, which provides opportunities to invest in venture capital funds that generate tangible social, environmental, and economic benefits. To date, we've invested in 28 funds focused on having a positive impact in our communities. We continue to actively support funds managed by diverse teams. In 2022, we made new fund investments focused on Indigenous entrepreneurs, sustainable agriculture, life sciences, health technology, and climate technology.\n\nVancity Community Investment Bank (VCIB) is exclusively focused on working with organizations that drive social, economic, and environmental change. It invests in areas such as clean energy projects, affordable housing, social purpose real estate, and values aligned businesses. For more information, see VCIB's website.\n\nVancity invests our assets to improve social inclusion, economic wellbeing, and environmental sustainability. See TBLAA on page 26 .\n\n## Fossil fuel free.\n\nVancity does not invest in or lend to fossil fuel companies. In 2019, we shifted all investment funds we manage to be fossil fuel-free. Our investment funds exclude oil and gas producers, pipeline companies, coal power producers, natural gas distribution utilities, LNG operations, as well as service companies whose primary business is supporting the fossil fuel industry.\n\nWe do have investments in banks which in turn invest in the fossil fuel industry. As a large institutional investor, we believe we achieve change more effectively by engaging with these banks on behalf of shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As we closed out a record year in 2021, we expected to see a moderation of lending activity and our overall financial performance to begin to take hold. However, the conditions that helped propel our results in 2021 largely continued, or even strengthened, through the first half of 2022. The result was a continuation of a record pace of lending growth and overall financial performance that was well ahead of our plans.\n\nAs we approached the second half of 2022, we began to see signs of potential strain on our organization due to the pace of lending growth that we had experienced over the previous 18 months. Just as we began implementing measures designed to moderate the pace of lending growth, we saw a dramatic change in economic and market conditions that drove a sharp slowdown in housing activity and business investments.\n\nAt the same time, the value of our Sustainable Wealth Management portfolio fell quickly alongside the market and net inflows slowed as investor confidence in the stock market declined. Deposit costs also rose sharply, and the effect of high inflation began to be felt across our organization.\n\nOverall, we delivered strong financial results in 2022, finishing ahead of our targets for operating earnings and net lending growth. Many other results, despite being below their respective targets for the year, were some of the strongest we've seen in recent history.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we expect unfavourable market conditions and unpredictability to persist, at least initially. We've taken action to strengthen our financial position and protect key investments while ensuring that Vancity is positioned for continued success going forward.\n\nOur 2023 financial plan calls for some moderation in our profitability and growth, with strengthening results through 2024 and beyond as market and economic conditions improve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo calculate how much profit we generate with every dollar of members' equity, we use a measurement called ROME, or return on average members' equity. This measurement shows the returns or business results that Vancity generates after taxes. In 2022, ROME was 4.6 per cent, slightly below our target of 4.7 per cent, mainly due to an increase in loan loss reserves to account for the uncertain economic environment.\n\n## ROME\n\n(business results)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ROME\n\n(after Shared Success)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Since 1994, we've given more than $444 million through the Shared Success program.\n\nWe distribute membership share dividends to members; it's how members directly take part in the success of our credit union. They also benefit from the money we invest into programs and partnerships to address systemic needs in our communities.\n\nWhile members will continue receiving share dividends, another part of Shared Success, Patronage payments, ended with the March 2022 distribution. Whereas paying dividends directly on member shares is the common practice in the rest of the credit union system, the Patronage program rewarded a smaller number of members based on the value of the Vancity products they had.\n\nThis change is aligned to our co-operative principles and was made with member feedback. Funds previously earmarked for Patronage payments are now added to the Shared Success program's pool for transformative community grants. When we asked members, 77 per cent told us they would be comfortable seeing their Patronage payments invested by Vancity to help advance social or environmental causes.",

We also didn't achieve our target for TBLAA in 2022 as a result of the fall in market value in our Sustainable Wealth Management portfolio, which represents over a quarter of our TBLAA balance.\n\nVancity was first in the Corporate Knights 2022 Sustainable Banking Revenues Ranking, based on the high proportion of income generated from TBLAA as a percentage of our total revenues.\n\n## Triple bottom line assets and assets under administration (billions)\n\nTotal assets plus assets under administration (billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The EPBRs provide a framework under which we make decisions that seek to increase positive impact, or reduce harm, for people and planet.\n\nIn 2022, we sourced 68 per cent of the value of our purchases from locally based businesses - about $88 million.\n\nIn 2022, we invested $16.8 million back into community through not-for-profit organizations and businesses. The vast majority (75 per cent) of our grants support strategic, larger scale initiatives through our Systems Transformation Grants. However, small grants, like those made through our Community Partnership Program and Community Branch Partnerships , play an important role in helping build new relationships with non-profit organizations we haven't worked with before. About one in 20 of these grant recipients end up being our partners in larger scale community projects and/or become Vancity loan recipients.\n\nWith every purchase made on an enviro \u2122 Visa credit card, five per cent of profits go to the Vancity enviroFund \u2122 . In 2022, we distributed more than $776,000 to 47 different organizations and projects to reduce the ecological footprint of our communities and increase the equitable redistribution of resources.\n\nVancity is a signatory to the BlackNorth pledge which commits us, among other things, to ensuring that by 2025 at least three per cent of donations and sponsorships are invested in initiatives that specifically serve Black communities. In 2022, it was 4.9 per cent ($697,100), exceeding that target.\n\nVancity is one of the largest funders of union-sponsored initiatives in BC, including research, education and advocacy, and skills-training and certification programs. In 2022, Vancity provided more than $1.5 million to labour-affiliated projects, including funding initiatives at the Living Wage for Families BC , BC Centre for Women in the Trades , the Columbia Institute , the Worker Solidarity Network , and the Union Cooperative Initiative .\n\nAs a financial services co-operative, we uphold the principle of co-operation among co-operatives. In 2022, we invested $1.2 million to strengthen co-operatives, including the BC Co-op Association , Solid State Community Industries , and the Canadian Worker Co-op Federation . We continued to support employees in undertaking graduate studies in Co-operative and Credit Union Management at Saint Mary's University.\n\n## The outcomes we aim for when we invest in  communities.\n\nIn 2022, we aimed to invest Shared Success allocations in line with the following outcomes.\n\n## Increased financial resilience through:\n\n- \u00b7 improved access to financial services\n- \u00b7 building financial confidence and savings\n- \u00b7 supporting sustainable businesses, co-operatives, and jobs\n- \u00b7 creating climate-ready affordable housing\n\n## Reduced carbon emissions through:\n\n- \u00b7 home energy and commercial building retrofits\n- \u00b7 decarbonization of businesses\n\n## Reconciliation and racial justice through:\n\n- \u00b7 a comprehensive Indigenous banking strategy\n- \u00b7 incorporating anti-racist practices and approaches in all that we do\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deeply embedding Reconciliation as one of Vancity's core values continued to be a focus in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we began the Progressive Aboriginal Relations \u2122 (PAR) program certification process run by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business. The program will help us to identify the most impactful opportunities and to hold ourselves accountable to this recognized framework. The PAR program provides an independent, third-party verification process of Vancity reports on leadership actions, employment, business development, and community relationships.\n\nCommitting to PAR will enable us to build on steps already taken such as being a founding partner of Reconciliation Canada , adopting the call to action for businesses from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and adopting the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples .\n\nIn 2022, we:\n\n- \u00b7  Filled a new role, Director of Indigenous Banking, to oversee the execution of our Indigenous Banking Strategy and the PAR program\n- \u00b7  Expanded our alternative identification requirements program to better meet the needs of Indigenous members\n- \u00b7  Became the founding partner of the Indigenous Prosperity Centre on Vancouver Island\n\nWe invested more than $2 million of our Shared Success community funds in initiatives designed to strengthen Indigenous communities. For example, we:\n\n- \u00b7  Partnered with Indigenous Peoples Resilience Fund to invest $215,000 set aside to support First Nations after the discovery of unmarked graves at former residential school sites\n- \u00b7  Funded the new Bears' Lair TV show, to uplift Indigenous innovation and entrepreneurship\n- \u00b7  Sponsored Science World's Sacred Journey exhibit about the tradition of ocean-going canoes\n\nIn 2023, we plan to develop a three-year Reconciliation Action Plan, including achieving PAR certification and a strategy for establishing an on-reserve presence. We'll roll out new cultural awareness training for our employees.

Board members are responsible for ensuring good governance at Vancity. They act as stewards of our organization, provide critical oversight, and help ensure that members' money is invested in ways that improve our communities.\n\nThe Board delegates the day-to-day management of Vancity to the President and Chief Executive Officer, who establishes the accountabilities of each member of the executive leadership team. Each Director serves on three or more committees and may be appointed to the Boards of our subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\nMembers of Vancity's Board of Directors are regularly in touch with our members and are active in the communities where they live and work. They represent the credit union at public events, meet with other credit unions and in some cases hold positions on other boards.\n\nDirectors receive a monetary sum for each year they serve on the Board (referred to as 'remuneration'). Remuneration differs from a salary in that Vancity does not hire Directors as employees; rather, members elect them to serve on the Board. At the 2022 annual general meeting, members approved the Director Remuneration for 2022-2025.\n\nFor more on the Board, including attendance records, professional development, remuneration, and the Board diversity statement, see Board of Directors .\n\n## Board of Directors election\n\nOne of the seven co-operative principles is 'democratic member control.' One way Vancity members have a say in the future direction of our credit union is by electing Directors annually for a term that normally runs three years, up to a maximum of four consecutive terms.\n\nThe Board considers regulatory expectations and feedback from members to establish a transparent election process. The Nominations and Elections committee works hard to attract a diverse range of candidates, including those with experience overseeing large organizations like Vancity.\n\nFor the 2022 election, the Committee included two Directors and four members-at-large and recommended four of six Board candidates. Members could vote for their choice of up to four candidates. The top three candidates were elected for three-year terms. The candidate who placed fourth was elected for a two-year period to fill a vacancy left by a Board member who resigned before the end of their term.\n\nA total of 26,705 members voted (5.2 per cent of eligible members).\n\nVancity would like to recognize the work of 2022 Board Chair Anita Braha, who leaves the Board in May 2023 after 12 years of service. Over that time, we've had the privilege and benefit of Anita's dedication to co-operative values and commitment to social justice. Her leadership and insight have been instrumental in proving that a financial co-operative, with its members, can be a powerful financial force for change.",

We set ourselves a higher target so that by the end of 2025 we reflect our community diversity with a Board and a senior management team where at least 40 per cent identify as Indigenous, Black, people of colour, 2SLGBTQIA+, gender or sexually diverse, and people living with a disability. In 2022, we exceeded these targets.\n\nAs part of the BlackNorth Pledge, we've also made a goal that, at a minimum, 3.5 per cent of senior leadership roles are held by Black leaders by 2025.\n\n## Gender parity\n\n(self-identified as women and/or transgender or non-binary)\n\n| Board               | 2025 Target 50%   |       |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------|\n|                     |                   | 66.7% |\n| Senior management 1 |                   |       |\n|                     |                   | 53.0% |\n\n## Under-represented groups\n\n(self-identified as Indigenous, Black or a person of colour and/or 2SLGBTQIA+ and/or gender or sexually diverse and/or living with a disability)\n\n| Board               | 2025 Target 40%   |       |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------|\n|                     |                   | 55.6% |\n| Senior management 1 |                   |       |\n|                     |                   | 50.6% |\n\n- 1  Senior management includes director-level roles and above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

When we knowingly and willingly take on risk, it's because we see the upside, and we use effective risk management techniques to provide an appropriate safety net.\n\nIn 2022, the areas of risk we focused most attention on included:\n\n- \u00b7  Macroeconomic environment: high inflation, rising interest rates, and their impact on our members and business\n- \u00b7  Credit: members in variable rate mortgages whose payments were sometimes insufficient to fulfil the payment on the loan, members who renewed their mortgage to a higher rate, and the commercial loans we have in office space which continue to remain vacant with many employers allowing flexible work options\n- \u00b7  Technology: modernizing our platforms to meet member expectations\n- \u00b7  People: attracting and retaining the employees we need, focusing on positive employee experience, and diverse representation among senior leadership\n\nWe also focused on these longer-term risks:\n\n- \u00b7  Meeting our net-zero goals and mitigating the impact of climate change on Vancity\n- \u00b7  Open banking\n- \u00b7  Digital disruption impacting the financial services industry\n\nFor more on risk management, see our (TCFD) climate-related financial risk disclosures in our Climate Report, Risk management on page 37 of the Accountability Statements, and Note 24 of the Financial risk management framework in the Consolidated Financial Statements, page 51.\n\n## Public policy and advocacy\n\nVancity regularly meets with and advises officials at every level of government to advance our commitment to building a cleaner and fairer world, and in service of our members, business, and regulatory needs. Our commitment to net zero by 2040, in particular, is highly dependent on enabling government policy and regulations.\n\nIn 2022, we participated in meetings and roundtables with key policymakers, including the Prime Minister of Canada, on topics such as affordable housing, climate resilience and disclosure, financial wellbeing, interest rates, open banking, and pay equity.\n\nAdvisory roles:\n\n- \u00b7  Vancity continued to participate in the federal Sustainable Finance Action Council to support the growth of a well-functioning, sustainable finance system\n- \u00b7  Our CEO shared insights with the BC Minister of Finance on sustainable, inclusive economic growth as a member of the provincial ESG Advisory Council\n- \u00b7  Vancity joined federal Open Banking working groups to help shape the development of a 'made in Canada' approach\n- \u00b7  Vancity joined the Bank of Canada roundtable on Canadian Digital Currency implementation to advise on the implications for consumers and the financial sector\n\nPolicy positions:\n\n- \u00b7  We advised Finance Canada on protecting people from high-interest and high-fee lending products\n- \u00b7  Vancity wrote submissions to the Government of Canada, Government of BC, the City of Vancouver, and Metro Vancouver, encouraging government actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from buildings while supporting the financial wellbeing of households and businesses\n- \u00b7  We also advocated for the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Canadian Securities Administrators to introduce comprehensive climate disclosure requirements\n\nVancity is aligning our public policy advocacy with limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, and in 2022, we signed on to related initiatives like the COP27 Action Declaration on Climate Policy Engagement .\n\nFor full details on Vancity's climate-related policy advocacy, see page 13 of our Climate Report.\n\nTo learn more about Vancity's overall approach to public policy and advocacy, and for a full list of our memberships in industry and advocacy organizations, see page 39 of the Accountability Statements.\n\n## Key international alliances we're a part of, and why.\n\nUN Environment Programme Finance Initiative's (UNEP-FI) Principles for Responsible Banking (PRB) Board and Leadership Council: to ensure that signatory banks' strategy and practice align with the vision society has set out for its future in the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement\n\nGlobal Alliance for Banking on Values: to change the banking system so that it's more transparent, supports economic, social and environmental sustainability, and is composed of a diverse range of banking institutions serving the real economy and the protection of our planet\n\nNet-Zero Banking Alliance, Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, and the UN Race to Zero: to support the global collective effort to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, to catalyze collaboration within the financial sector and to foster systemic change internationally\n\n<!-- image -->",

Building on work in 2020 and 2021, we refreshed our analysis in 2022 using UNEP-FI's updated Portfolio Impact Analysis Tools for Banks, complemented by stakeholder surveys and Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) emissions analysis.\n\nOur analysis re-confirmed climate, and financial health and inclusion as Vancity's two most significant areas of impact. It also provided a deeper understanding of the sectors and products driving these impacts - primarily consumer banking products and real estate and construction lending - and the links between these and other important impact areas, including housing, waste, resource intensity, biodiversity, and livelihoods.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on these results, the priority UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to our most significant impact areas are:\n\n## Climate Stability\n\nFinancial Health and Inclusion, Livelihoods, Equality and Justice\n\nWaste, Resource Intensity, and Biodiversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The results shown are based on data available in 2022.\n\n## Step 1: Establish scope\n\nWe focused our analysis on Vancity's core business areas: consumer and business banking in Canada, primarily in BC. We expanded the scope of our business banking analysis to include Vancity Capital Corporation (VCC) and our Ontario-based subsidiary Vancity Community Investment Bank (VCIB). We also analyzed Vancity's on-balance sheet treasury investments and owned real estate. When measured by gross income, this brings the total portion of our business under analysis to 91 per cent. As relevant data becomes available, we plan to explore expanding our analysis to cover the remaining nine per cent, which includes Vancity's managed client assets.\n\n## Step 2: Portfolio composition\n\nOur consumer portfolio accounts for 67 per cent of our loan book and our business banking portfolio accounts for 33 per cent. Below is a summary of consumer products and the business sectors we provide financing to. As we improve our data and tracking capabilities, we plan to explore how segmentation (e.g., income level, gender) can help us further understand impacts driven by member/population types.\n\nBy applying the mapping tools in UNEP FI's Portfolio Impact Analysis Institutional Banking, Consumer Banking, and Investment modules, we identified the following potential positive and negative impacts associated with the sectors or products in the tables above, and the links between them. Note: We used Version 3 of the PRB institutional and consumer banking modules, which were updated in 2022, and Version 2 of the investment module, which was published in 2021.\n\n| Business banking: loans and mortgages to   small- and medium-sized enterprises,   top 10 industry sectors   | % of  portfolio   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Real estate activities                                                                                      | 51.7%             |\n| Construction of buildings (residential and commercial)                                                      | 9.7%              |\n| Financial intermediation                                                                                    | 7.0%              |\n| Membership, civic, social, and religious organizations                                                      | 6.1%              |\n| Management of companies and enterprises                                                                     | 5.3%              |\n| Other construction including specialty contractors                                                          | 3.2%              |\n| Healthcare and social assistance                                                                            | 3.0%              |\n| Wholesale trade                                                                                             | 2.9%              |\n| Accommodation and food services                                                                             | 2.2%              |\n| Office administrative services                                                                              | 1.1%              |\n\n| Consumer banking and lending products   | % of  members  accessing   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Savings accounts                        | 93%                        |\n| Chequing accounts                       | 71%                        |\n| Credit cards                            | 40%                        |\n| Lines of credit (approved)              | 23%                        |\n| Residential mortgages                   | 9%                         |\n| Consumer loans                          | 3%                         |\n| Overdrafts                              | 3%                         |\n| Vehicle loans                           | 0.24%                      |\n| Microcredit                             | 0.04%                      |\n\n<!-- image -->",

For instance, our microcredit products, which support access to finance for underserved groups like refugees and newcomers, and our on-reserve housing loans for Indigenous community members, are associated with alleviating inequality.\n\nRetail mortgage lending is associated with potential key positive impacts on housing and on financial inclusion by allowing individuals and families to build equity.\n\n## Real estate and construction lending\n\nThe most significant impact areas associated with our business banking portfolio are driven by our real estate and construction loans.\n\n## Potential positive impacts\n\n## Potential negative impacts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancing for residential real estate has potential key positive impacts on access to quality housing, which is linked to increased opportunities for stable employment and access to education.\n\nBuilding preservation may contribute to waste reduction and heritage conservation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsumer credit products may also drive moderate negative impacts on justice and inequality due to the potential for discrimination resulting from traditional systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReal estate development has the potential to drive key negative impacts on climate stability due to the emissions associated with some buildings.\n\nReal estate also shows moderate negative impacts related to housing due to the potential in some areas to exacerbate gentrification (e.g., displacement of existing community and businesses, and increasing housing inaccessibility).\n\nConstruction and operation of buildings may drive key negative impacts on resource intensity (e.g., building materials, energy, and water use) and on waste (e.g., construction waste) both of which can be linked to negative impacts on biodiversity.\n\nSome construction is associated with further key negative impacts on biodiversity due to the creation of nonporous surfaces, the potential for soil deterioration, and for habitat loss affecting species.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Small- and medium-size enterprise lending\n\nWhile not key impacts, most of our business lending supports small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - including social enterprises, non-profits, and co-operatives.\n\n## Potential positive impacts\n\n## Potential negative impacts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLending to SMEs is associated with potential moderate positive impacts on employment and wages. SMEs account for the majority of companies and approximately half of private sector employment in BC.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDepending on the sector, SME lending can also be associated with potential moderate negative impacts on employment and wages, and on health and safety. For example, agriculture and manufacturing are associated with higher health and safety risks, while some service sectors (e.g., accommodation, food and beverage) can sometimes be associated with lower wages and lack of benefits.\n\nLike businesses of all sizes, some SMEs may also be resource intensive and produce significant waste.\n\n## Treasury investments\n\nPotential positive and negative impacts associated with Vancity's own assets are driven primarily by Treasury investments in government, corporate, and covered bonds.\n\n## Potential positive impacts\n\n## Potential negative impacts\n\nOur Treasury investments in government and corporate bonds are associated positively with inclusive economies, employment, and wages because governments provide enabling environments for economic activity, and both governments and corporations are providers of employment.\n\nSome investments in Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) covered bonds may have positive impacts on climate and circularity, as noted under real estate and construction.\n\nSome investments in CMHC covered bonds may have negative impacts on housing, as noted under real estate and construction.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This dual focus supports our Climate Commitments strategy to work towards a climate transition that puts people at its centre and leaves no one behind. The analysis also showed Housing as a significant area of impact. We manage this as a part of our Financial Health and Inclusion and Climate work, including developing specialized offerings and tracking relevant performance metrics, but we are not setting separate targets for housing at this time.\n\nTo understand our climate impact, we measure and disclose our financed emissions annually, continuing to expand coverage and data quality over time in line with the PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard. Most of our lending supports real estate through lending to homeowners and businesses. In 2022, we established our 2019 baseline year data and published our interim climate targets and strategy which focuses on how we will meet our emission targets for residential and commercial service buildings. Our real estate targets cover 81 per cent of our balance sheet lending (dollars outstanding at the end of 2021). See page 19 for an overview of our financed emissions by asset class.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we built on research begun in 2021 to better understand the level of resilience and vulnerability of our members. 2022's research reinforced key themes from 2021 and highlighted the opportunity to further analyze the unique characteristics and needs of Vancity members who fall into the 'extremely vulnerable' and 'financially vulnerable' categories. The 2022 study also concluded that extreme weather events are proven to negatively impact households' financial vulnerability, highlighting the correlation between climate change, financial stress, and financial vulnerability.\n\nWe've developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for Climate and are in the process of selecting KPIs and measuring performance for Financial Health and Inclusion. This includes a context analysis, identifying the Canadian and provincial policies and strategies that are relevant to our target setting, and determining baseline measurements. Outreach with many internal stakeholders is underway, which is helping inform both baseline and target setting processes.\n\nFor how we are using this impact analysis, see the Principles for Responsible Banking Self-Assessment .",

As such, Vancity applies the Applicable Criteria, as defined in Table 1 above.\n\n## Vancity's responsibilities\n\nManagement is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7  The preparation and presentation of the Subject Matter Information, in accordance with the Applicable Criteria, current as at the date of our report;\n- \u00b7  Determining the appropriateness of the use of the Applicable Criteria;\n- \u00b7  Determining Vancity's objectives in respect of accountability performance and reporting, including the identification of stakeholders and material issues; and\n- \u00b7  Such internal control as management determines necessary to enable the preparation and presentation of the Subject Matter Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express an assurance conclusion based on evidence obtained. We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. For the Subject Matter Information on which we are providing limited assurance, ISAE 3000 and ISAE 3410 require that we plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, any matter(s) has come to our attention to cause us to believe that the Subject Matter Information is materially misstated.\n\nWe were engaged to perform a reasonable or limited assurance engagement according to the Subject Matter being assured.  The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Accordingly, it is not a guarantee that a limited assurance engagement conducted in accordance with this standard will always detect a matter that causes the practitioner to believe that the Subject Matter Information is materially misstated.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the decisions of users of our report.\n\nThe nature, timing and extent of procedures performed depends on our professional judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and involves obtaining evidence about the Subject Matter Information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe nature, timing and extent of procedures depended on our professional judgement including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, as well as, the level of assurance being provided and involves obtaining evidence about the Subject Matter Information. Our engagement included:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessing the appropriateness of the s Subject Matter Information, the suitability of the criteria used by Vancity in preparing the Subject Matter Information in the circumstances of the engagement and evaluating the appropriateness of the methods, policies, and models used in the preparation of Subject Matter Information and the reasonableness of estimates made by Vancity.\n- \u00b7  Obtaining supporting evidence relating to representations made in the PRB Self-Assessment and reviewing key organizational documents concerning accountability at Vancity including impact analysis, target setting, strategy documents, formalized policies and procedures, and Board reporting;\n- \u00b7  Inquiries with relevant employees and completing walkthroughs to understand the data collection and reporting processes for the targets and results;\n- \u00b7  Testing the design, and where applicable, the operating effectiveness, of internal controls relating to the collection and reporting of data measuring Vancity's progress on the targets and results and financed emissions calculation;\n- \u00b7  Comparing the reported data for the targets and results, including greenhouse gas emissions and carbon offsets, to underlying data sources, including third-party evidence;\n- \u00b7  Evaluation of key assumptions and, where appropriate, re-performing certain calculations; and\n- \u00b7  Reviewing the Subject Matter Information presented in the Report and the PRB Self-Assessment to determine whether reported progress is consistent with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the social, environmental and economic performance of Vancity.\n\nWe believe the evidence we obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance conclusion on Subject Matter 1, our limited assurance conclusion on Subject Matters 2 and 3 and our qualified limited assurance conclusion for Subject Matter 4.",

The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques which can result in materially different measurements and can impact comparability. The nature and methods used to determine such information, as described in management's internally developed criteria, may change over time. It is important to read Vancity's reporting methodology in the 2022 Annual Report glossary, the accountability statements, and the 2022 Climate Report available at www.vancity.com/annualreport .\n\n## Basis for qualified limited assurance conclusion - Subject Matter 4\n\nVancity applies the PCAF Standard in the calculation of Financed GHG emissions and Percentage change in financed GHG emissions since 2019 described in Subject Matter 4 above. The PCAF Standard attributes a building's annual emissions to the mortgage provider using a loan-to-value ratio based on the property value at the time of loan origination. As noted on page 10 of the Report, the property values used by Vancity in calculating the attribution factor to determine financed emissions for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2022 are dynamic (non-fixed) figures that represent the most recently available property values at the time the data was pulled. Vancity's methodology is a deviation from the PCAF Standard and results in attribution factors, and consequently attributable building emissions, that are inconsistent year over year. Details on Vancity's financed GHG emissions estimation methodology can be found in the 2022 Climate Report available at www.vancity.com/annualreport .\n\nThe scope of our work was limited as we were unable to verify the accuracy of the attribution factor calculation and its impact on Vancity's Financed GHG emissions and Percentage change in financed GHG emissions since 2019 in accordance with the PCAF Standard. Accordingly, verification of the attribution factor calculation was limited to the numerator (i.e., the outstanding loan amount at year-end) and we were not able to determine the materiality of the deviation from the PCAF Standard.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\nIn our opinion, the Report presents fairly, in all material respects, Subject Matter 1, as described above, for the year ended December 31, 2022, in accordance with the appliable criteria, current as at the date of our report.\n\nBased on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that for the year ended December 31, 2022, Subject Matter 2, as described above, has not been prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Applicable Criteria, current as at the date of our report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBased on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2019, Subject Matter 3, as described above, has not been prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Applicable Criteria, current as at the date of our report.\n\nOur conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this report. Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, except for the possible effects of the matter described above in the 'Basis for Qualified Limited Assurance Conclusion' paragraph, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that for the years ended December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2019, Subject Matter 4, as described above, has not been prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Applicable Criteria, current as at the date of our report.\n\n## Specific purpose of subject matter information\n\nThe Subject Matter Information has been prepared in accordance with the Applicable Criteria and as a result may not be suitable for another purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants May 4, 2023 Vancouver, Canada",
