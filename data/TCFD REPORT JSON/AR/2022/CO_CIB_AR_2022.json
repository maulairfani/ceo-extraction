We report on the main achievements aligned with the strategy and the goals to be met. In the final segment we present the GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) content index, the economic, environmental, and social indicators that contribute to the compilation of a sustainability report. We also present the SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) indicator index to estimate structured reporting of these indicators in this first year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis document has been prepared per the Core option of the GRI Standards. We are committed  to  working  under  this  methodology  to  deliver  a  report  on  our administration  that  is  increasingly  tailored  to  the  different  stakeholders  and  to continue learning in the process. This report was verified by a third party who reviewed its  content  adaptation  to  the  Global  Reporting  Initiative's  Sustainability  Reporting Standard (GRI Standard).\n\nLikewise, we account for the commitment we have to sustainability through the work done  by  the  volunteer  management  of  the  10  United  Nations  Global  Compact Principles, the contribution to the fulfillment of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals),  the  commitments  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  and  participation  in  benchmark frameworks  such  as  the  Dow  Jones  Sustainability  Index  (DJSI),  Equator  Principles, United  Nations  Environmental  Program  -  Financial  Initiative  (UNEP  FI),  Carbon Disclosure  Project  (CDP),  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment  (PRI),  Principles  for Responsible  Banking,  UN  Women,  Partnership  for  Carbon  Accounting  Financials (PCAF),  Net  Zero  Banking  Alliance  (NZBA),  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related  Financial Disclosure (TCFD), the Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for NetZero, among others.",

We know that, if people feel more comfortable with their finances, banks will be their ally to grow and progress.\n\nTherefore,  maintaining  trust  is  a  priority  that  invites  us  to  make people who reach out to us feel heard, find responsible guidance and a solution consistent with our purpose.\n\nWe believe that we must all learn to make good financial decisions, to measure and manage our savings, expenses and investments.\n\nThis is a path we have been building for decades. Our purpose is clear: to promote sustainable development to achieve the well-being of all. It is a commitment that each of our more than 31,000 employees has internalized and that we apply in our daily work, knowing that it is the way to create a better organization for today's and tomorrow's world.\n\nWith  this  vision,  we  bring  today  transforming  results  and  tangible contributions  to  promote  widely  the  competitiveness  of  the productive fabric of the social base, each entrepreneur and the SMEs and companies that drive long-term development.\n\nDriven  by  our  purpose,  in  2022  we  worked  on building  more sustainable  cities  and  communities,  transitioning  to  a  low-carbon economy.\n\nAnd we worked together with all social actors to increase financial inclusion capabilities, a vital force for development in our countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJuan Carlos Mora Uribe",

We are convinced that by strengthening the productive fabric  of  our  countries,  building  sustainable  cities  and  communities,  and promoting access to financial services as a tool for social inclusion, we can achieve greater impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe also believe in projects led by women, because of the impact they have not only on them but also on their families. In 2022, we granted more than COP 9 trillion in loans only for women, ranging from low-interest loans to solve urgent needs, through consumer loans and resources for high-impact entrepreneurship, to specialized financing with a gender focus.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLikewise, we have made agriculture a priority. This implies understanding the particularities of the different subsectors and their chains to provide them with the financial services they require for their activity. Last year alone,  we  provided  them with loans for COP 10.5 trillion. In addition, thanks to productive linkages, we have been able to reach more small producers. The Cooperativa Departamental de Caficultores del Huila is an example of this. Thanks to this program, it has financed 194 small producers with disbursements of more than COP 5,693 million.\n\nAs part of this strategic path, we commit to mobilize COP 500 trillion in this  decade.  We  have  already  mobilized  COP  102  trillion  for  tangible projects  with  a  direct  effect  on  creating  conditions  to  ensure sustainability in our countries.\n\nThis support has enabled the development of initiatives that promote the decarbonization of the economy, reducing emissions by 1.6 million tons of CO2 , equivalent to 26 million trees. Likewise, we financed 2,500 sustainable housing units.",

More  than  6.6  million  people  already  use  our inclusion  platform  A  la  Mano  and  14.9  million use Nequi. For one in four of them this is their first experience with the financial sector.\n\nBringing credit to more people has represented an  important  work  to  get  to  know  our  clients better and  adjust  our  risk  policies, while maintaining a balance with the responsibility we have with savers' resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese applications allow people to use their money securely and easily, as well as make payments, recharges and other transactions at no cost.

We  must  focus  on  a  growth  and confidence-building  agenda.  We  will  help  companies and individuals to live in a different scenario, in which macroeconomic  conditions  will  increase  the  cost  of capital resulting in a higher cost of financing. We must focus  on  creating  the  right  conditions  to  encourage savings and long-term investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2023, we will continue to be the main ally of SMEs, businesses, independents and companies in projects that generate employment, diversification and competitiveness for the benefit of all people.

We  want  to  be  the  ally  that  allows  them  to  take advantage of opportunities and better manage their resources in their daily lives. Thus,  we  generate  well-being  by  strengthening  the competitiveness of companies (the country's productive fabric). We also promote  financial  inclusion  so  that  more  people  and  companies  are integrated. Likewise, we seek to contribute to the economic development of the countries where we operate. Furthermore, we offer solutions that contribute to the construction  of  more  sustainable  cities  and communities, contributing to an increasingly cleaner planet.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Achieving Customer Loyalty and Preference\n\nWe  are  an  organization  that  stands  out  for  providing  reliable, approachable, timely and user-friendly experiences. We are committed to earning your loyalty, as measured by your referral over our competitors and our growth in market share. Consequently, we are working to offer you a better service through the reduction of Queries, Complaints, and Claims QCC (AQR, by its Spanish acronym) that generate most issues. And we are improving  the  experience  we  offer  you,  by  strengthening  our  digital portfolio  to  promote  the  acquisition  of  our  solutions  through  digital channels. At the same time, we strive to provide you with more and better alternatives for the movement of your money.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe support our clients with a wise portfolio management. Precisely, the pursuit of this growth also requires us to make significant investments in digitization  and  modernization  to  maintain  our  leadership  in  an increasingly competitive market. However, these investments put pressure on  our  efficiency  level,  so  we  will  continue  to  proactively  manage  the organization's  main  expenses  and  leverage  revenues  from  our  financial and non-financial portfolio solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building Culture and Talent to Foster Competitiveness\n\nWe have a team of more than 30,000 employees in four countries.

Actual results may differ materially from the anticipated results indicated or implied by these forward-looking statements.\n\n## Main Trends in the Region (LAC)\n\nLatin America moderated its economic growth compared to 2021 given inflationary pressures, lower capital flows, tighter financial and monetary conditions, and the appreciation of the dollar against almost all the region's currencies. In addition, the war in Ukraine and logistical stress at the beginning of the year affected world trade and weakened external demand.\n\nHowever, the return of the service sectors and employment to pre-pandemic levels, the solid performance of remittances, the recovery of tourism and the rise in commodity prices, which benefited the countries of the region that export primary goods, allowed the economies to improve their performance.\n\nLatinFocus  estimates  that  the  region  grew  by  3.3%  in  2022,  resulting  in production above the 2019 level. However, the outlook for the future is quite challenging given the uncertainty of the expected slowdown in most of the world's economies.",

Thus,  the  country's  GDP  level  has exceeded  potential  capacities,  leading  to  a  situation  of  strengthening domestic demand beyond what is sustainable in the long term.\n\nAs a result, additional inflationary pressure has arisen in a context in which prices  were  affected  by  a  strong  international  supply  shock  on  the production  of  inputs  of  all  kinds,  but  particularly  for  the  agricultural industry. Consequently, consumer inflation increased rapidly and reached an annual rate of 13.12% during the year, the highest of this century.\n\nBanco de la Rep\u00fablica has responded to this inflationary situation with sharp increases in the monetary policy interest rate. Thus, after keeping it at a historic minimum for a little more than a year, a process began in August  2021  that  caused  this  reference  interest  rate  to  increase  from 1.75% to 12% at the end of 2022. Therefore, over the last year the country has  experienced  the  strongest  monetary  adjustment,  both  in  total magnitude  and  in  the  speed  of  increases,  since  the  inflation  targeting scheme  has  been  in  force.  It  has  been  a  year  in  which  local  and international financial conditions have tightened substantially.\n\nMoreover, this took place in a legislative and presidential election year. The country elected a new administration with a less orthodox economic proposal  than  those  that  characterized  previous  administrations.  This process of change was accompanied by uncertainty, which was caused by the impact of the restrictive international financial situation on the local market. The government debt market experienced the effect through a significant devaluation of yield curves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Panama\n\nThe Panamanian economy grew by 9.8% and 9.5% in the second and third quarters of 2022, after being the Latin American economy that advanced the most during the first quarter. This was the result of the dynamism of copper  exports,  the  recovery  of  the  Panama  Canal  activity  and  the outstanding  performance  of  the  construction,  manufacturing,  retail, hotels, restaurants, transportation and communications sectors.\n\nIn 2022, inflation reached its peak in June (4.4% annually), which led to social protests that resulted in agreements to moderate prices through price  controls  on  food  and  medicine,  as  well  as  fuel  subsidies.  Thus, inflation decreased to 1.9% in November.\n\n## Guatemala\n\nThe economy grew at annual rates of 4.5% and 4.1% in the first and second quarters  of  2022,  partly  due  to  modest  dynamics  in  sectors  such  as agriculture, mining and construction, as well as moderation in household consumption  and  investment.  However,  the  inflow  of  remittances, essential  for  household  spending  and  economic  growth,  continued  to advance at superlative rates, after exceeding in November the amounts received throughout 2021.\n\nInflation increased consistently to peak in October (9.7%) and decline to 9.17% in November, 4.17 percentage points above the upper limit of the central bank's goal (3%-5%).",

This  also  led  to  increases  in  household consumption and exports.\n\nIn  addition,  the  growth  of  remittances  once  again  reached  historic highs, which continues to consolidate its position as a major source of household and economic income. As of November 2022, remittances totaled USD 6,982 million, after an annual growth rate of 3.4%.\n\n## United States\n\nThe U.S. economy slowed significantly in 2022.

In its latest edition of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecasts that the region's growth will moderate to 1.7%.\n\nThis will be supported to a large extent by the effect of the  general  weakness  of  the  international  economy, while monetary  and  financial  conditions  remain challenging  and  fiscal  consolidation  processes  are underway. In addition, the economic management of the  new  governments  and  the  trend  in  commodity prices will be key.\n\n- For  Colombia,  high  interest  rates  will  result  in  a  significant slowdown of the economy and a cooling of domestic demand. This will be combined with a context of international economic slowdown,  weakening  the  demand  for  our  non-traditional exports.  In  addition,  uncertainty  about  changes  in  local economic  policy  will  continue  to  be  relevant  given  the  new government's ambitious reform agenda. 2023 is expected to be a year of modest economic growth (we project that it will only be 0.9%).\n\nHowever,  on  the  downside,  the  price  dynamics  will  be  less challenging.  The  weakening  of  domestic  demand,  together with progress in the process of normalization of international logistics  chains  and  stabilization  of  agricultural  input  costs, will lead to a reduction in inflation. We estimate that consumer prices will close 2023 with an increase of 7.5%.\n\nThis would be possible as long as interest rates remain high in the first half of next year. Only when inflation is showing clear signs  of  convergence,  there  will  be  room  to  start  a  slow process of cuts that will lead to policy interest rates closing 2023 at 10%. This will be accompanied by the continuation of the fiscal adjustment that the country needs and that would allow  a  reduction  of  the  National  Government  deficit  from 5.5% of GDP in 2022 to less than 4.5% of GDP in 2023.\n\n- We believe that Panama's economy will slow down this year (4%)  because  of  the  effect  of  the  lower  dynamics  of  the international economy on trade exchanges and its effect on flows in the Panama Canal.\n- We also  expect  the  Guatemalan  economy  to  grow  by  2.7%, influenced by the economic slowdown in the U.S., given that the U.S. is the country's largest recipient of exports and the main  source  of  remittances.  Additionally,  we  expect  local monetary  tightening  and  the  easing  of  global  supply bottlenecks  to  reduce  inflation  to  levels  close  to  the  upper limit of the central bank's inflation target of 4.9%.\n- For El Salvador, we expect the economy to grow 1.6%, given that the U.S. slowdown would weigh on remittance flows into the  Salvadoran  economy,  which  would  decrease  domestic consumption. However, several  risks  loom  over  our  forecast horizon, stemming  from  the  political and diplomatic management  of  the  country.  First,  tensions  between  El Salvador  and  the  U.S.  could  affect  the  flow  of  remittances, given a possible withdrawal of work permit for Salvadorans in the U.S. (TPS). Moreover, the risk of a sovereign default will remain, amid slow progress on fiscal consolidation, and in the absence of an agreement with the IMF.\n- Finally,  in  the  United  States,  we  expect  economic activity to grow at a rate of 1.8%. This would be the lagged effect of the interest rate increases seen in 2022 and the global slowdown. In addition, we expect the federal funds rate to reach the peak range of 5%-5.25% in the first quarter of 2023, at which point we expect the economy to be in a mild technical recession. However,  there  is  a  growing  risk  that  the  available  stable funding  will  raise  rates  further  if  inflation  does  not  slow significantly in the coming months.",

The most important variables include GDP growth (discussed in the previous text), interest rates, inflation and exchange rates, mainly the U.S. dollar/Colombian peso.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Colombian  Central  Bank's  reference interest rate stood at 12%, after an increase of 900 bps during the year. The year closed in the middle of a process of monetary policy interest rate hikes. Given that the current level of monetary policy interest rates is already considered contractionary, it is reasonable to think that the process of interest rate hikes will end soon.\n\nClosing inflation for  2022  was  13.12%,  significantly  higher  than  the 5.62% recorded for 2021. Since it was well above the upper limit of the Central Bank's tolerance range (4%) and still on an upward trend, this is one of the key factors behind the expectation that the interest rate will remain high during the coming quarters.\n\nThe Colombian peso depreciated 20.82% against the USD in 2022, with the  USDCOP  closing  at  COP  4,810.2,  compared  to  a  depreciation  of 15.98%  in  2021,  in  which  the  USDCOP  closed  at  COP  3,981.16.  The Colombian peso closed 2022 in a context of high financial stress faced by the world during the year and local uncertainty about the changes that the country's economic policy will undergo after the election of the new government.\n\nThe outlook for the Colombian financial sector in general, and for Bancolombia in particular, will depend on the factors listed below:\n\n## Favorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium term\n\n## Unfavorable factors for the Colombian economy - medium term\n\n- \u00b7 The temporary protected status program for Venezuelan migrants should strengthen their integration and enhance Colombia's economic potential.\n- \u00b7 Record of macroeconomic and financial stability.\n- \u00b7 An independent central bank with an inflation targeting regime.\n- \u00b7 A free-floating currency.\n- \u00b7 The government is committed to comply with Colombia's fiscal and monetary framework, adhering to the independence of the central bank and the updated fiscal rule.\n- \u00b7 The extra revenues from the latest tax reform will be used for social spending, which may favor demand from lower-income households and boost some goods and services segments.\n- \u00b7 The prospects for investment in renewable energy could improve with this administration's goals.\n- \u00b7 A solid cushion of foreign exchange reserves will mitigate external vulnerabilities.\n- \u00b7 Recent high fiscal deficits that have already resulted in relatively large increases in debt and interest burdens against similar countries.\n- \u00b7 Commodity-dependent export base vulnerable to price shocks.\n- \u00b7 Weak external accounts.\n- \u00b7 Government efforts to halt new oil exploration and ban fracking could create uncertainties for the sector and undermine investment.\n- \u00b7 The government's reform agenda in 2023 is expected to change to focus on potentially controversial pension reform.\n- \u00b7 Expected fiscal adjustment through high taxes.\n- \u00b7 Tighter internal and external financial conditions.\n- \u00b7 Lower average oil prices, weaker global growth and higher global interest rates are expected in the coming years.\n- \u00b7 The risk of civil unrest will be high, reflecting the deep divisions within Colombian society, as well as the fragmentation in Congress that will prevent rapid progress in addressing problems such as poverty and poor-quality education.",

This can be attributed to the rise in inflation in the short and medium term,  resulting  in  a  tighter  monetary  policy.  Consequently,  central  banks  have progressively increased interest rates, leading to higher final prices, particularly in credit rates. This has significantly influenced the net interest margin of the financial sector throughout 2022.\n\nFactors such as geopolitical tensions, the crisis in the real estate sector, and the lingering impact of COVID-19 on China are expected to have substantial implications for the global economic outlook and hinder economic growth in 2023.\n\nAs a result of high-interest rates, financial tensions, the global slowdown, and capital market uncertainties, aggregate demand is projected to decline by 2023. Although recent  data  from  the  National  Administrative  Department  of  Statistics  (DANE) suggests a decrease in the unemployment rate, there has not been a corresponding increase in the employment rate, which has experienced setbacks. It is expected that the annual unemployment rate will rise, coupled with a deterioration in household and business confidence. These factors will have implications for portfolio growth and deterioration, particularly in the consumption sector.\n\nDANE figures for the third and fourth quarters of 2022 indicate a slowdown in the Colombian economy. This downward trend has been endorsed by organizations such as the World Bank, which have revised their expectations for the country in 2023.\n\nIn terms of inflation, although a correction is anticipated, it is likely to remain above the issuer's target for the current year due to increased prices of essential goods and services  such  as  food,  electricity,  transportation,  and  hotels.  Monetary  policy  is expected to remain contractionary throughout 2023, but there are expectations of reference rate cuts in the second half of the year, leading to a decrease in the net interest margin.\n\nGiven the limited financial conditions, lower external financing flows are expected for  2023.  This,  in  turn,  would  lead  to  an  average  increase  in  the  exchange  rate. Consequently, the observed inflation levels of 2022, combined with the revaluation impact and greater pressure on labor costs, could result in higher expenses and a deterioration in the financial efficiency indicator.\n\nThe National Government has announced its intention to make an addition to the 2023 Financial Plan in the first quarter of the year, despite the Finance Minister's commitment  to  adhering  to  the  fiscal  rule.  This  aspect  could  potentially  trigger inflationary  pressures.  Investor  confidence  may  be  affected  by  uncertainties regarding the allocation of these new resources, thereby influencing the perception of country risk. This, in turn, could lead to an increase in the cost of capital and more expensive funds.\n\nFurthermore, the economic performance in the various geographical regions where Grupo Bancolombia operates will be impacted by the lackluster dynamism of the United States, its primary trading partner and main source of remittances. This will result in a decrease in aggregate demand, reflected in reduced inflows from abroad and lower private consumption. Consequently, there could be a slowdown in the demand for credit, thereby impacting Grupo Bancolombia's figures.",

The table below provides an overview of the composition of liquid assets over the past two years:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Liquid assets   (1)            | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| High-quality liquid assets *   |                     |                     |\n| Cash                           | 26,299,990          | 22,641,516          |\n| High-quality liquid securities | 17,739,501          | 18,258,002          |\n| Other liquid assets            |                     |                     |\n| Other securities   **          | 4,019,688           | 3,299,371           |\n| Total liquid assets            | 48,059,179          | 44,198,889          |\n\n*High-quality liquid assets encompass cash and shares that meet the criteria for reportable operations or repurchase agreements. This category also includes liquid assets received by the Central Bank for its monetary expansion and contraction operations, as outlined in paragraph 3.1.1 of the Foreign Regulatory Circular DODM-142 issued by the Bank of the Republic.\n\n**Other securities consist of securities issued by financial and corporate entities.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, liquid assets experienced a growth of COP 3.86 billion, primarily driven by an increase in cash and high-quality liquid securities. This change is a result of the higher demand deposits, leading to elevated reserve  requirements  (cash)  and  excess  liquidity,  which  have  been  managed  by  purchasing  high-quality  liquid securities within the treasury portfolio.\n\nThe Bank conducts daily measurements of liquid assets and compares the results with a target determined by the Risk Committee. According to this rule, daily liquid assets must be equal to or greater than the set target. If the limit is not met, there is a five-day period to enhance liquidity levels.\n\nCash  plays  a  vital  role  in  ensuring  the  smooth  operations  of  branches  and  ATMs.  The  Bank's  expansion  across Colombia necessitates substantial levels of cash. However, cash levels are monitored daily to minimize opportunity costs. Moreover, cash is considered in the mandatory bank reserve established by the Central Bank.\n\nThe  ALCO  reviews  the  securities  that  constitute  liquid  assets  based  on  the  Bank's  liquidity  goal.  While available-for-sale debt securities held to maturity cannot be sold, they can be pledged as collateral in repurchase agreements. Some of these securities are mandatory investments that can be submitted to the Central Bank as collateral.\n\nThe Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC) mandates financial institutions to maintain liquid assets exceeding the one-month cumulative contractual liquidity gap. This contractual gap reflects the maturity of current asset and liability positions and does not account for future operational projections. The maturity of the loan portfolio for this purpose  is  influenced  by  historical  default  indicators,  while  deposit  maturity  is  modeled  in  accordance  with regulations.\n\nThe  Bank's  management  considers  the  current  liquidity  level  to  be  satisfactory  and  aims  to  preserve  its  strong deposit  base  and  access  to  alternative  financing  sources,  including  loans  from  domestic  and  international development and commercial banks, repurchase agreements, bond issuances, overnight funds, and Central Bank funds.  This  approach  takes  into  account  market  conditions,  interest  rates,  and  the  desired  maturity  profile  of liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## Funding structure\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Bank's  liabilities  amounted  to  COP  312,817  billion,  representing  a 22.23%  increase  compared  to  December  31,  2021.  Liabilities  denominated  in  Colombian  pesos recorded a growth of 16.24%, while liabilities denominated in US dollars increased by 31.25%. This change is primarily attributed to the rise in term deposits denominated in both COP and USD, savings accounts denominated in USD, and credits with other financial institutions offset by a decrease in debt securities in issue and in current accounts denominated in COP. However, although USD-denominated liabilities increased by 31.25%, this was affected by the depreciation of the USD/COP exchange rate (20.82% in 2022).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Denominated in COP   | 178,861,272   | 153,871,797   |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Denominated in USD   | 133,955,910   | 102,057,793   |\n| Total liabilities    | 312,817,182   | 255,929,590   |\n\nAt the end of the year, the Bank experienced a deposit growth reaching COP 250,992 billion. This represents an increase of COP 40,601 billion, or 19.30%, compared to the deposit level as of December 31, 2021. The growth in deposits can be attributed to various factors. COP-denominated deposits saw a rise of 14.20%, primarily driven by an increase in COP-denominated term deposits. On the other hand, USD-denominated deposits increased by 28.12%, mainly due to the growth in USD-denominated savings accounts and term deposits.\n\nThe ratio of deposits to total assets stood at 71.14%, marking a decrease of 144 basis points compared to 2021. Deposits serve as the Bank's primary sources of financing, encompassing checking accounts, term  deposits,  and  savings  accounts.  In  2022,  deposits  accounted  for  80.1%  of  the  Bank's  total liabilities, showing a decrease from 82.2% recorded at the end of the fiscal year 2021.\n\n## Seasonality in deposits\n\nHistorically, the bank has observed seasonal fluctuations in its demand deposits. It typically experiences lower levels of liquidity during the first months of the year, followed by higher levels of liquidity towards the end of the year. This pattern can be attributed to various factors, including the injection of liquidity into the market through monetary expansion operations conducted by Banco de la Rep\u00fablica (the Central Bank of Colombia) and the National Government. These measures are in response to increased economic activity and transactional quality.\n\nIn 2022, the Central Bank eliminated the programs and measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a normalization of monetary policy. This was characterized by interest rate hikes aimed at controlling inflation. The increase in interest rates resulted in a decreased preference for liquidity, which was reflected in the growth of term deposits in the final quarter of the year. However, it is worth noting that the seasonality in deposits does not significantly impact the operation of the business, as excess or shortage of liquidity is managed through the treasury portfolio.\n\nThe ratio of net portfolio to deposits, including loans with other entities, stood at 94.00% at the end of 2022, showing an increase from 93.38% compared to 2021. This change can be primarily attributed to the growth of net loans and advances to customers, which increased from COP 204,459 million in 2021 to COP 254,444 million in 2022. This growth exceeded the increase in deposits, which amounted to COP 51,742 billion, reaching COP 270,684 billion in 2022.\n\nTo finance its operations, the bank utilizes loans from financial institutions, which were used to replace maturing debt securities in 2022. However, in order to maintain a lower cost of funds, the growth of the credit portfolio was primarily financed by deposits. Moreover, Bancolombia's loans with financial institutions are linked to various market rates and indices, such as the Bank Reference Indicator (BRI; a short-term benchmark interest rate of Colombian money market liquidity that reflects the price at which banks are willing to lend or borrow funds from the financial market), DTF, CPI, LIBOR, and SOFR.\n\nIn 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for calculating the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement has created uncertainty regarding the future of LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark. As of December 31, 2022, Bancolombia had USD 605 million in liabilities linked to LIBOR, accounting for 0.93% of its total liabilities at that time.\n\nIt  is  important  to  highlight  that  two  years  after  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  government  and  the  Central  Bank eliminated the measures and restrictions that were implemented. This resulted in a normalization of monetary policy and a recovery of economic activity, leading to improved performance of the loan portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, compliance with the NSFR2 in 2022, rising inflation, and local and international political uncertainty created additional pressures on the cost of short- and long-term refinancing operations.\n\nFurthermore, in the second half of the year, the bank issued sustainability-linked bonds aimed at financing initiatives benefiting 1.5 million low-income individuals and reducing CO2 emissions by 36% over the next three years.",

This was primarily driven by an increase in customer deposits, which amounted to COP 23,214 billion, surpassing the increase of COP 19,290 billion in 2021. Additionally, interest received contributed to the positive cash flow, totaling COP 23,603 billion, compared to COP 15,896 billion in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the Bank witnessed a substantial increase in loans and advances to customers and financial institutions, amounting to COP 37,593 billion in 2022. This growth exceeded the increases of COP 24,057 billion in 2021 and COP 7,440 billion in 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, interest payments resulted in a cash outflow, with COP 7,508 billion in 2022, COP 4,410 billion in 2021, and COP 6,149 billion in 2020.\n\nIn terms of investment securities, there was a positive net change in the value of securities recognized at fair value through profits and losses.

This was an increase compared to the purchases of COP 3,722 billion in 2021 and COP 3,670 billion in 2020. The maturity of debt securities at amortized cost contributed COP 4,260 billion in 2022, COP 2,984 billion in 2021, and COP 2,728 billion in 2020.\n\nRegarding investment activities related to fair value debt instruments through other comprehensive income (OCI), the Bank generated net cash of COP 235 billion in 2022 and COP 1,848 billion in 2021.\n\nInvestment activities related to capital value and shares resulted in a net cash outflow of COP 56 billion in 2022, while in 2021, it provided net cash of COP 24 billion.\n\nLastly, investment activities associated with the purchases and sales of shops, equipment, and investment properties consumed net cash of COP 3,117 billion in 2022, compared to COP 1,632 billion in 2021 and COP 1,261 billion in 2020.\n\n## Funding activities\n\nIn 2022, the product of credits with other financial institutions contributed COP 14,374 billion, showing an increase compared to the contributions of COP 4,182 billion in 2021 and COP 12,453 billion in 2020. Furthermore, the placement of outstanding debt securities provided COP 2,138 billion in 2022, COP 1,387 billion in 2021, and COP 3,766 billion in 2020.\n\nCredit reimbursement resulted in a cash outflow of COP 5,874 billion in 2022, which was lower than the amounts used in 2021 (COP 8,447 billion) and 2020 (COP 14,919 billion). Additionally, payments of debt securities in issue used COP 6,699 billion in 2022, COP 1,871 billion in 2021, and COP 5,382 billion in 2020.\n\nDividends to shareholders were paid in the amount of COP 2,310 billion in 2022, while in 2021 and 2020, the amounts were COP 467 billion and COP 1,555 billion, respectively.\n\nLastly, the decrease in repurchase agreements and other similar secured loans resulted in a cash outflow of COP 579 billion in 2022, compared to COP 1,457 billion in 2021 and an accrual of COP 903 billion in 2020.",

As  of  December  31,  2022,  the  stockholders'  equity attributable  to  the  owners  of  the  parent  company  reached COP 39,089 billion, representing a 21.27% increase compared to the COP 32,234 billion recorded on December 31, 2021. This growth  is  primarily  attributed  to  the  generation  of  profits during  2022  and  the  depreciation  of  the  Colombian  peso against the US dollar.\n\nThe Bank's consolidated capital solvency ratio stood at 12.79% as  of  December  31,  2022,  which  is  lower  than  the  15.49% reported in 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the Bank's capital solvency ratio surpassed the requirements  set  by  the  Colombian  government  and  the Financial Superintendency by 379 basis points, exceeding the minimum  requirement  of  9%  imposed  by  the  Colombian regulator. The core capital index (Tier 1) was 10.37%, and the tangible  capital  ratio,  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  net  worth minus goodwill and intangible assets to tangible assets, was 8.21% at the end of 2022.\n\nThe following table provides relevant information on the Bank's consolidated capital adequacy as of December 31, 2022, and 2021:\n\n## Grupo Bancolombia\n\n## December 31, 2022\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n| Common Equity Tier 1                                                             | 40,652,350    | 34,575,361                                     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Shares                                                                           | 480,914       | 480,914                                        |\n| Additional paid-in capital                                                       | 5,441,658     | 5,441,658                                      |\n| Adjustment by Conversion in Financial Statements                                 |               | -

Of  this  amount,  around  COP  122,927  million  was  invested  in  channels, while COP 102,820 million was directed toward technology-related investments.\n\nLooking  ahead  to  2023,  Bancolombia  plans  to  invest  approximately  COP  469,858 million. The majority of this investment will focus on the evolution and transformation of  products,  channels,  technological  infrastructure,  cybersecurity,  and  fixed  asset investments, including the remodeling of headquarters and offices.\n\nIn the medium term, it is anticipated that investment expenditure (Capex) associated with fixed assets and technology may experience less significant growth. This can be attributed to the current trend of remote work and the evolving hiring model of tech suppliers. The shift towards remote work reduces the need for investments in buildings and  administrative  headquarters,  while  the  adoption  of  software  as  a  service  (SaaS) models in tech supplier contracts includes ongoing license usage, updates, maintenance, support, and usage-based charges. It is important to note that this does not necessarily indicate a decrease in overall investment.\n\n*Please note that the figures provided are estimates and are subject to change as the Bank continues to evaluate its project portfolio. Therefore, there is no guarantee that all capital expenditures will be realized, and if they are, they may differ from the currently anticipated amounts.\n\nThe following table summarizes the main purchases, sales of capital, and divestments of interests in other companies made by the Bank in the fiscal years ending on December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\n\n## December 31,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Capital purchases   (1)                | Type of investment          | 2022                        | 2021                        | 2020                        | Total                       |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| In Colombian pesos millions            | In Colombian pesos millions | In Colombian pesos millions | In Colombian pesos millions | In Colombian pesos millions | In Colombian pesos millions |\n| FCP Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia        | Subsidiary                  | 816,081                     | -                           | -                           | 816,081                     |\n| P.A* Mercurio                          | Subsidiary                  | 249,492                     | -                           | -                           | 249,492                     |\n| Nequi S.A.                             | Subsidiary                  | 150,000                     | -                           | -                           | 150,000                     |\n| P.A.

As usual, in 2022 this effort was  channeled  mainly  through  the  4  quarterly  earnings  conferences,  around  a hundred individual meetings and participation in 19 capital market events where we interacted with institutional investors, analysts and other issuers.\n\nIn addition, the Investor Relations Department team handled all other requests for information from investors and processed the needs of shareholders through the Bancolombia Shareholder Service Center.\n\nWe must highlight that all the effort and commitment to this management made us worthy of the Issuers - IR Recognition, granted by the Colombian Stock Exchange to the companies with the highest standards of disclosure of information of a social, environmental and corporate governance nature, as well as best practices in investor relations.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It also makes it easier for companies to manage their resources in an agile and  efficient  way,  in  accordance  with  each individual's reality.\n\nWith the financial activity it is possible to channel money efficiently to the different needs of a motion economy. This is how people can have the resources for consumption, to buy a house, a car, pay for their children's  education  or  start  a  business,  without having to accumulate every peso beforehand.\n\nIn  turn,  companies can undertake investments to grow  and  generate  jobs,  and  countries  can undertake major works to ensure competitiveness and  quality  of  life,  thanks  to  the  experience accumulated  not  only  in  banking,  but  also  in specialized needs such as fiduciary, capital markets, investment banking and treasury.\n\nThis  entails  a  great  responsibility  and,  therefore, financial  soundness  is  one  of  our  top  strategic priorities  at  Bancolombia.  Our  main  asset  is  the trust that countries, their public and private sectors and their people have placed in us. For this reason, we  ensure  that  we  take  care  of  income  and expenditure, efficiency, solvency and profitability, so that we can continue to support the economy, the environment and society.\n\nIt is the success of people and companies of all sizes in projects that translate into well-being, quality of life and competitiveness for our countries that ensures good organizational results. In other words, if we are doing well in Bancolombia, it is because our countries are doing well.",

The  issue  for  an  amount  of  COP  640,000 million and with a 5-year term, was subscribed by IDB Invest  and  Finance  in  Motion.  With  this  bond,  we  are committed  to  provide  financing  to  more  than  1.5 million  unbanked low-income people and reduce CO2 emissions in our financing portfolio.\n- We  designed  and  structured  a  new  category  of medium-term financing tied to sustainability indicators with  international  banks,  with  which  we  obtained resources  for  USD  250  million.  This  new  financing format represents an evolution in our relationship with banks  and  a  competitive  advantage  in  accessing medium-term  resources,  in  line  with  our  corporate purpose.\n- We structured a USD 400 million, 3-year syndicated loan for Banistmo in which 11 international banks participated. Despite an adverse economic environment,  Grupo  Bancolombia  consolidated  its access to the capital markets to meet its medium-term funding needs.\n- We maintained an efficient financing structure, which was reflected in the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which remained above the minimum risk appetite level: 103%.  We  achieved  this  with  training  of  CDTs  with  a term between 10 and 15 years for COP 4.1 trillion, loans with foreign banks for USD 692 million and the efficient use  of  the  excess  liquidity  of  Off  Shore  subsidiaries through  the  acquisition  of  liability  loans  with  foreign exchange hedging for USD 47 million.\n- In  Bancolombia  Panam\u00e1,  we  increased  our  customer base  by  81%  and  achieved  the  granularity  in  the depositor  base  acquired  during  the  year  through  the development  of  a  proposal  for  the  massification  of foreign  currency  accounts  for  Colombian  customers with wealth diversification needs.\n- In Banco Agr\u00edcola we obtained funding aligned with our purpose. For the first time we generated a subordinated debt (USD 70 million with IDB Invest) and expanded our alliance with IFC (USD 70,000 million, totaling USD 323 million  with  IFC),  obtaining  the  participation  of  6  B Lender  investors  (of  Dutch,  German  and  Panamanian origin). These operations were achieved at the time of highest country risk in El Salvador's history.\n- At BAM we managed liquidity through the issuance of long-term (3 to 5 years) CDTs for USD 38 million, taking advantage of current rates. We also arranged USD 192 million in quotas with local banks, to be used as working capital and to support business growth.\n- With  the  support  and  assistance  of  the  Investor Relations  and  Corporate  Capital  Markets  team,  we replaced the maturity of Banistmo's inaugural USD 500 million international bond. The maturity was refinanced with the company's own resources and a successful USD 320  million  syndicated  loan,  in  which  11  entities participated.

We  must highlight our experience and proximity to key stakeholders in infrastructure development.\n- We  continue  to  support  private  equity investment  alternatives  with  top  quality managers.  At the close of 2022, Fiduciaria Bancolombia reached COP 10.1 trillion in assets  under  management  in  the  Private Equity  Funds  (PEF)  and  FICI  line,  with  a 26% growth compared to 2021.\n- The  Odinsa  V\u00edas  PEF  started  investing  in road  projects  in  the  Andean  Region.  For these  projects,  investors  Odinsa,  with extensive experience in the road transport infrastructure  sector,  and  Macquarie,  an Australian financial services company with an asset management  division that manages the largest infrastructure investment  portfolio  in  the  world,  are joining forces.  The fund begins with the usufruct of investments in 4 road concessions:  Autopista  del  Caf\u00e9,  T\u00fanel Aburr\u00e1 Oriente, La Pintada and Malla Vial de Los Llanos. The initial value of the fund is close to COP 823,000 million and could reach COP 10 trillion in 10 years.\n- From investment banking we also participated  in  dozens  of  transactions, among which we highlight the structuring and  financial  closing  of  five  important road concessions in the country: Pac\u00edfico 2,  Pasto-Rumichaca,  Cambao-Manizales, V\u00edas del Nus and Malla Vial del Valle.\n\nThese  projects  represent  an  additional portfolio  for  Grupo  Bancolombia  of  COP 2.3  trillion,  consolidating  a  total  of  COP 6.2  trillion  in  14  4G  and  5G  projects.  In other  words,  in  2022  alone,  projects representing 37% of Bancolombia's commitments in 4G and 5G infrastructure were  structured,  representing  a  total  of 903  km  of  the  2540  km  of  roads  that Grupo  Bancolombia  has  financed  in  4G and 5G.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, given the current rate  environment,  more  flexible  financial  closings  were  sought  through mini-perm structures and joint analysis of the bank-trust ecosystem.\n- Plan 500 will contribute to greater competitiveness in Cundinamarca and will  provide  better  conditions  for  the  development  of  agricultural  and productive  sectors  in  the  regions.  Bancolombia  participated  in  this  plan with financing of COP 400,000 million. These resources will be allocated to 13  projects,  including  the  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  500  km  of secondary roads, which will impact nearly 23 municipalities by improving the department's road networks.\n- Together with Findeter, we have supported projects to generate adequate infrastructure for the mission processes of teaching, research and service. We  disbursed  COP  60,000  MM  to  the  Pontificia  Universidad  Javeriana through the Findeter Reactiva line. These resources will be destined to the adequacy of the new School of Sciences and its teaching laboratories, for undergraduate and postgraduate practices.\n- We supported the Bogot\u00e1 Development Plan. We closed a COP 1 trillion financing with the district to support the implementation of high impact projects for the city, such as the Metro, the cable de San Crist\u00f3bal, among others.\n- We financed BTG's Visum Real Estate Fund in a financial leasing transaction for COP 250,000 million for the construction and development of one of the largest retail distribution centers in Colombia. The construction will be 85,000m 2 in  an  area  of  100,000m 2 ,  will  be  built  as  a  BTS  and  leased  to Falabella.  The  leasing  contract  was  closed  for  15  years  with  a  source  of payment from the Falabella contract,  one  of  the  largest  deals  closed  in recent years.\n- The Fondo Inmobiliario Colombia (FIC) PEF closed 2022 with assets under management value of 4.8 trillion COP, with an increase of 14% compared to the  close  of  2021.  Meanwhile,  leasing  revenues  decreased  by  2.0% compared to 2021, exceeding $171 billion COP.",

Under a post-pandemic recovery scenario, we continue to deepen our market, supporting risk and collateral management, and resource management to provide transparency among business stakeholders.\n\n## New business in the corporate segment grew 5% and in the business segment grew 30%.\n\n## The following are some of the additional infrastructures:\n\n- In public trusts, we were once again awarded the FOPEP trust contract, whose managed resources will amount to COP 39 trillion and which serves more than 300,000 pensioners of the central government and its decentralized entities. This contract also gives pensioners access to Bancolombia's banking product portfolio.\n- We support the development of the creative economy by managing the resources of film and series projects for streaming platforms. We had 31 deals with resources managed for COP 1.2 trillion in 2022 and productions  of  series  and  movies  such  as  One  Hundred  Years  of Solitude (Netflix), Brotherhood (Prime) and The Big Cigar (Warner).\n- We  made  progress  in  our  consolidation  as  a  benchmark  for  the management  of  assets  and  flows  of  Fintech  platforms,  channeling funding resources to their operations for more than COP 1.47 trillion. Likewise,  by  using  our  solutions  to  enable  funding  sources  for Fintechs, we connect with financial inclusion initiatives, which broaden the  base  of  banked  people  and  contribute  to  financial  education, rebanking and the development of new credit products.\n- We contribute to sustainability initiatives by enabling businesses in the Non-Conventional Renewable Energy sector, through guarantee and payment  source  schemes  with  financing  from  national  and international sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  the  second  half  of  the  year,  clients  were more uncertain about their long-term projects, due to the international and local context.

On the other hand, project launches  in  the  second  part  of  the  year decreased,  reflecting  the  uncertainties  of supply and demand in the sector.\n\n2023 will be a challenging year in all aspects, anticipating scenarios of inflation, high interest  rates,  risk  and  uncertainty  over  the long term.  However, the business strategy has been  redesigned  to  meet  the  changing environment.

The  most relevant  milestones  include  the  financial  closing  of Solarpack's  La  Mata  (108.3  MWp)  and  La  Uni\u00f3n  (144.5 MWp) projects, and Canadian Solar's Caracol\u00ed (56.0 MWp) project.  The  three  projects  have  a  total  capacity  of  308 MWp and are the first financial closings of the Ministry of Mines and Energy's renewable energy auctions.\n\nIn addition, the Vice-Presidency of Capital Investments and Special Situations managed an investment portfolio with an asset value of COP 364,131 million as of October 2022. The portfolio consisted of shares in various economic sectors, including real estate, infrastructure, energy, industrial, and Non-Performance Loans (NPL). The value of the portfolio experienced  a  significant  increase  of  24.6%  compared  to the  end  of  2021,  when  it  stood  at  COP  292,142  million. Throughout the year, notable investments were made, such as the acquisition of new NPL portfolios from Reintegra and real estate for housing development and subsequent sale.\n\nHowever,  the  year  2022  posed  challenges  for  the  local capital  market  due  to  factors  such  as  the  geopolitical conflict  in  Russia,  global  and  local  inflationary  pressures, the  implementation  of  the  Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio (NSFR), and the political situation arising from the election year  in  Colombia.  In  this  challenging  environment,  the volume  of  corporate  debt  issued  in  2022  amounted  to approximately 30% of the previous year's issuance. Banca de Inversi\u00f3n Bancolombia (BIB) played a significant role in this  market,  capturing  45%  of  the  market  share  and structuring eight transactions, three of which were backed by the Fondo Nacional de Garant\u00edas as part of the Unidos por Colombia program.\n\n| Customer                                                  | Amount Placed   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Total Placed BIB (Including Private Issuances)            | 1,638,289       |\n| Total Placed Market (Including Private Issuances BIB)     | 3,292,500       |\n| % Structured BIB                                          | 50%             |\n| Total Market Placements (Including Private Issuances BIB) | 16              |\n| Total Structured BIB (Including Private Issuances)        | 10              |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Of  these  transactions,  we  highlight  the  USD 348 million financing, through a syndicated loan led by Grupo Bancolombia, to AES El Salvador, a company that supplies 70% of that country's electricity with four distribution companies.

Nearly COP 3.3 trillion correspond to customer investments made through our entities abroad. And approximately COP 45 trillion are from the treasury business.

We know that Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) criteria are essential to fulfill our purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince our 2014 adherence to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), supported by the United Nations, we have challenged ourselves to incorporate these criteria as a fundamental and integral element in all our investment processes. On this journey, and with the experience and knowledge acquired, we have deepened the integration of sustainability in our products and service offerings, our recommendations to the market and our own position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## In 2022 we reached the following milestones:\n\nAs part of our business ambition to mobilize at least COP 500 trillion by 2030 through financial services in activities associated with the purpose, from the Asset Management  front  we  reached  more  than  COP  3  trillion  in  assets  under management with ESG criteria.\n\nWe joined  the  Net  Zero  Asset  Managers  initiative  by  committing  to  align  our investment portfolios with carbon-neutral scenarios by 2050. Therefore, for the second year we carried out our measurement of the indirect carbon footprint of our investments under the PCAF methodology and we defined our science-based goals, which were submitted to validation by the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi).  Emissions  from  our  investment  portfolios  of  245,000  tons  CO2e  Scope 1+2+3  (Mining  and  O&G  only)  represent  0.07%  of  Grupo  Bancolombia's  total emissions. Our reduction targets were determined under the Temperature Rating methodology, aligning the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of our asset management investment portfolio to 1.5\u00b0C by 2040 and 2.0\u00b0C including Scope 3, with 2021 as the base year.\n\nDue to the region's lack of information and ESG ratings, we continue applying our proprietary ESG assessment models under international standards. By 2022, we have 39 internally rated local issuers, expanding our ESG ratings coverage, which allows us to make responsible decisions aligned with our ESG policies.\n\nWe developed and published our Policy for the exercise of political rights under Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance standards, which includes ESG criteria for exercising voting rights at shareholders' meetings and is part of our Responsible Investment Policy.\n\nWe  built  tools  to  perform  sustainability  analysis  for  assets  that  lacked  an evaluation  methodology,  such  as  green,  social  and  sustainable  bond  issuances and securitizations.",

Based  on  this,  we  take  actions  to  close  gaps  and strengthen our reputation.\n\nThus, in  2022,  according  to  the  Corporate  Reputation  Business Monitor  (Merco),  for  the  eighth  consecutive  year,  we  are  the company with the best reputation in Colombia. Likewise, according to our own study conducted under the RepTrak measurement model, we  managed  to  increase  the  ratings  given  by  the  public  to  Grupo Bancolombia in all the countries where we operate.\n\nIn  fact,  Bancolombia  achieved a  strong  a  strong  assessment  of 72.2/100, more than six points above the average given by individual customers  and  non-customers  to  the  financial  sector worldwide. These results are leveraged by being an organization that has in its purpose a different way of doing business , with the responsibility to positively  impact  society,  through  the  integration  of  ESG  criteria (environmental, social and governance) within our strategy.\n\nIn  addition,  over  the  past  few  years  we  have  seen  how  difficult situations around the world are becoming increasingly interconnected,  even  if  they  appear  to  be  unrelated  to  each  other. Therefore, at Grupo Bancolombia we understand that any risk faced by the organization, financial (market, liquidity or credit) or non-financial,  that  is  related  to  business  performance,  identity, corporate  governance  and  management  decision  making,  may materialize and have a negative impact on our reputation and on the relationship with the different stakeholders.\n\nThis  is  the  origin  of  our  growing  interest  in  valuing  and  managing reputational  impact  risk  (RIR),  which  allows  us  to  monitor  the organization's behavior in these situations and make decisions based on objective criteria, finding a balance between business profitability and reputation. This is an intangible asset that we continue to manage vigorously and that allows us to have support in times of uncertainty, attract  talent  and  the  investors'  attention,  and  foster  increasingly strong and lasting relationships of trust.",

The delivery of timely, relevant and high-quality information is fundamental to our Directors' decision making.\n\nAs an additional measure for the handling of information, the Directors  are  required  to  securely  store  and  protect  the confidentiality  of  the  information  they  have  access  to, therefore, they must use it exclusively to perform their duties in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  Code  of  Good Governance.\n\nIn  addition  to  making  the  information  and  documentation available  to  the  Directors  in  the  application,  the  Legal  Vice President  and  General  Secretary  is  responsible  for  keeping the  Board  of  Directors'  minute  books  in  accordance  with current regulations, which faithfully reveal the development of  the  meetings,  and  for  ensuring  compliance  with  the policies  and  guidelines established in the Corporate Bylaws and in the Code of Good Governance.\n\nFurthermore, as provided in the Board of Directors' operating regulations  found  in  Section  3.1.  of  the  Code  of  Good Governance,  the  Directors  must  have  the  time  available  to assume their responsibilities in the service of Bancolombia, which  includes  thoroughly  reviewing  the  material  and attending the meetings. Availability also implies an attendance  that  must  not  be  less  than  80%  of  the  total number of ordinary annual meetings for the Board, except in the case of justified force majeure.\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Directors held 12 ordinary meetings and 2 extraordinary meetings, with an average attendance of 93.9%. The average attendance to Board and Committee meetings by each Director is as follows:\n\nLuis Fernando Restrepo\n\nSilvina Vatnick\n\nAndr\u00e9s Felipe Mej\u00eda\n\nGonzalo Alberto P\u00e9rez 2\n\nJuan David Escobar\n\nArturo Condo 3\n\nSylvia Escovar\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n94.74%\n\n92.59%\n\n96.66%\n\n80.95%\n\n2 Gonzalo P\u00e9rez was a member of the Good Governance Committee until April 30. During these months, his participation in this Committee was 100%.\n\n3 Arturo Condo joined the Good Governance Committee as of May 1. The average attendance is calculated from the date of appointment and on the total number of Committees held as of that date.\n\nFor Grupo Bancolombia, attracting and retaining Directors with high knowledge and competencies that generate value and meet strategic objectives is a priority. Thus, to keep the relative value of the Board of Directors'  fees  updated  in  an  economic  context  of  inflation  and depreciation of the Colombian  peso,  the  Ordinary  General Shareholders' Meeting of 2022 approved an increase of CPI+2% on the  monthly  fees  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  on  the  fees  for participation in Support Committees. With said increase, the amount of  the  fees  for  Directors  residing  in  Colombia  was  defined  as  COP 10,762,000.00  (Ten  Million  Seven  Hundred  Sixty-Two  Thousand Colombian Pesos), and that of independent Directors residing abroad as  USD  3,000  payable  in  U.S.  dollars,  for  monthly  fees  and  for participation  in  Support  Committees.  Additionally,  these  Directors were authorized travel expenses equivalent to USD 250 per day of travel for their attendance to the Board or Committees.\n\nThe  amount  of  these  fees  is  paid  70%  in  cash  and  the remaining  30%  is  paid  through  a  contribution  to  the  SVA Institutional  Fund  whose  only  investment  is  shares  of  the Bank and which is subject to a term of permanence of the contribution for two (2) years. In 2022, the total value paid to members for their participation in the Board and the different Support Committees amounted to one billion nine hundred thirty-six  million  six  hundred  thirty  thousand  five  hundred thirty-nine (COP 1,936,630,539).\n\nIn  the  development  of  the  training  activities  for  our managers, in 2022, the participation of our Board of Directors in the training program called The World of Tomorrow of the Instituto de Empresa in Madrid stands out. In this program, we  studied  the  international  geopolitical  panorama,  the future  of  the  economy,  global  trends  and  the  challenges faced by companies and the financial system in the world and in  Colombia.  Likewise,  the  Board  of  Directors  received training in Fintechs, decentralized finance and communication in complex environments, by internationally recognized experts in each of these topics. In addition, the Directors received training in cybersecurity and information security from senior IBM executives.\n\nTo  measure  the  performance  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  as contemplated in the Code of Good Governance, evaluations of  this  collegiate  body  are  carried  out  on  an  annual  basis. Evaluations alternate between internal and external assessments.  For  fiscal  year  2022,  a  self-evaluation  of  the Board of Directors  and  its  support  committees  was  carried out.  The  results  were  evaluated  by  the  Good  Governance Committee and the Board of Directors and will be taken into account in 2023 for the permanent dynamics of improvement of the governing body.",

Additionally, the Committee orders and monitors that the internal control procedures are adjusted to the needs, objectives, goals and strategies determined by the Bank and that they are framed within the internal control objectives. Among these procedures are the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, reliability in financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe Committee supervises the integrity of the financial statements, the  financial  information  process  and  the  internal  accounting  and financial control systems, ensuring the reliability and timeliness of the information  disclosed  to  the  market,  with  the  support  of  the Disclosure  Committee.  Likewise,  the  Audit  Committee  must  know, prior  to  their  execution,  the  criteria  for  determining  the  price  and other conditions of the material and non-recurring transactions to be executed with related parties.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Committee  followed  up  on  the  implementation  of Circular  012  of  2022,  issued  by  the  Financial  Superintendence  of Colombia,  and  its  impact  on  the  different  control  and  year-end activities, ensuring that the entity had the necessary resources and plans to comply with the Circular.\n\nBancolombia's  Internal  and  External  Auditors  and  the  Compliance Officer report to the Audit Committee, the Ethics Committee and the Disclosure Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors, as part of its functions and decision making, if it deems it convenient, may request external advisors' technical and specialized  support,  other  than  those  hired  by  management.

The Vice President of Human Resources acts as secretary of this committee.\n\nThe main task of the Appointment, Compensation and Development Committee is to support the Board of Directors in determining the policies  and  provisions  for  the  selection,  appointment,  hiring  and remuneration of Senior Management and all matters related to the Grupo Bancolombia's remuneration model.\n\nThe  Appointment,  Compensation  and  Development  Committee's functions are to (i) determine human resources management policies, establishing the selection, evaluation, compensation and development  processes  for  Senior  Management;  (ii)  establish objective  criteria  for  hiring  our  principal  officers;  (iii)  propose objective criteria for hiring Senior Management and design succession plans; (iv) determine the criteria for evaluating the performance of Senior Management; and (v) provide recommendations to the Board of Directors on the appointment and compensation of the President and Senior Management.\n\nThe  Appointment,  Compensation  and  Development  Committee recommends  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  define  the  variable compensation  model  for  the  President,  Vice  President,  and employees,  which  rewards  the  integral  vision  of  the  business, teamwork  and  the  pursuit  of  profitable,  efficient,  sustainable  and people-based  growth.

Senior Management includes the President  of  Bancolombia  S.A.  and  the  Vice  Presidents  who  report directly to him.\n\nThe CV of each of the members of Senior Management is available in the Directors and Administrators tab, through the following link:\n\nClick here\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the selection, remuneration and replacement of Senior Management, as well as the assignment of their  main  responsibilities  and  the  supervision  of  their  succession plan,  for  which  it  relies  on  the  Appointment,  Compensation  and Development Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors' Chairman annually evaluates the performance of Bancolombia's President, who also evaluates the performance of the  executives  who  report  directly  to  him.  The  Chairman  has  the obligation to keep the Board of Directors informed of the results of the management team's evaluations.\n\nBancolombia  seeks  to  stimulate  the  long-term  thinking  of  the organization, reward the generation of value, align the interests of the  management team with the interests of the shareholders, and recognize and incentivize the high performance of the management team in line with the organizational strategy. Therefore, the President and  Vice  Presidents  of  Bancolombia  have  a  variable  remuneration represented in units of participation in the Value-Added System Fund (SVA, by its Spanish acronym) managed by Protecci\u00f3n, which invests exclusively in Bancolombia shares and has a term of permanence of three (3) years. Beneficiaries  receive  30%  of  their  variable compensation in units of the fund. All the above is under the policies approved by the shareholders' meeting.\n\nNote 27 of the individual financial statements contains the detail of labor payments to the Senior Management.\n\nThe withdrawal of the SVA Fund's resources and the trading of the Fund's  shares  must  undergo  a  procedure  of  authorization  by  the Board of Directors. Likewise, the liquidation of units in the Fund by members of Senior Management is disclosed to the market through the relevant information mechanism.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  authorized  retirement  transactions from  SVA  to  Jaime  Villegas,  Vice  President  of  Corporate  Services, Mar\u00eda  Cristina  Arrast\u00eda  Uribe,  Vice  President  of  Business  and  Jos\u00e9 Mauricio  Rodr\u00edguez,  Vice  President  of  Internal  Audit.

Therefore, we enter into agreements and alliances under the needs and evolution of the business.\n\nOur  commercial  and  business  relationships  with  related parties  are  entered  into  at  market  prices  and  in  Grupo Bancolombia's best interest. Although such transactions are not conflictive, managers may face dilemmas in decision-making. Hence, Grupo Bancolombia employees and managers  shall  exercise  prudence  when  dealing  with  an actual or apparent conflict of interest, following the internal policies and guidelines set for this purpose. These policies are included in our Code of Good Governance and our Code of Ethics and Conduct, which can be consulted on our website.\n\nOur Code of Good Governance considers as related parties the  companies  subject  to  Bancolombia's  supervision,  our members of the Board of Directors and Senior Management, including their spouses and children, the companies in which our  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  Senior Management  have  an  investment  of  more  than  10%,  the entities that make up the Sura Bancolombia Conglomerate, and other shareholders of Bancolombia with a stake in our capital stock of more than 10%. In addition, this document contains  policies  based  on  which  transactions  with  related parties  are  classified  according  to  their  recurrence  and materiality.  These  policies  allow  adequate  standards  of identification,  disclosure,  evaluation  and  in  some  cases approval to be applied to those operations that, due to their materiality,  require  greater  attention  from  a  corporate governance perspective.\n\nIn 2022, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of Bancolombia  evaluated  the  capitalization  of  the  company Administradora  de  Fondos  de  Pensiones  y  Cesant\u00edas Protecci\u00f3n S.A., the proposed spin-off and incorporation of an  insurance  company,  the  sale  of  the  shares  of  the insurance company to Sura Asset Management S.A. and the sale of shares  of  Protecci\u00f3n  to  Banca  de  Inversi\u00f3n Bancolombia S.A., Corporaci\u00f3n Financiera. Specifically, prior to the execution of the transactions indicated, Bancolombia's Audit Committee was informed of the criteria for  determining  the  price  and  other  conditions,  analyzed their  justification  and  the  economic  rationale  for  Grupo Bancolombia, and gave its approval. The committee did this considering  that  the  transactions  under  analysis  would  be made between related parties, were non-recurring operations as they were not part of the ordinary course of business and were material in the terms defined in the Good Governance  Code.    Likewise,  the  Audit  Committee  was informed about the potential conflicts of interest that the Directors  could  face  at  the  moment  of  knowing  about, discussing and approving these transactions.\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Audit Committee and after  discussing  in  detail  and  analyzing  their  economic  and sectorial justification, as well as their implications, the Board of Directors approved the transactions with the required quorum and majority. The Directors with potential conflicts of interest, following the recommendation of the Audit Committee and in compliance  with  the  Code  of  Good  Governance  and  the Corporate Bylaws, brought the situation to the attention of the  Board  of  Directors,  withdrew  from  the  meeting  and abstained from participating in the deliberation and adoption of decisions.\n\nSpecifically,  transactions  with  entities  belonging  to  the  Sura Bancolombia Financial Conglomerate were entered based on the  best  interest  of  each  of  the  parties  to  obtain  better conditions for their own business, under the premise of not jeopardizing the companies' ability to meet their obligations to third parties.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  monitored  the  treasury  operations performed  with  our  related  economic  parties  every  month, following the market risk classification. These operations were executed under market conditions and in compliance with the procedures  established.  These  transactions  were  carried  out under  market  conditions  and  in  compliance  with  the procedures established for such purpose.\n\nIn addition, according to the Organic Statute of the Financial System, certain credit operations, including those of administrators and their relatives, require the approval of the Board  of  Directors,  except  for  the  vote  of  the  respective Director, if applicable. Thus,  for  2022,  after  verifying compliance with debt and risk concentration limits, two credit quotas were submitted to the consideration of the Board of Directors.  Their  approval  implied  the  abstention  of  the respective  Director  and  was  unanimously  authorized  by  the other members of the Board of Directors.\n\nBancolombia disclosed its transactions with related parties in note 27 of the separate financial statements.",

Employees know the ICS and the different programs that develop or complement it at the various levels and units of the Organization. The ICS is an integral part of the operation and is periodically reviewed to ensure continuous improvement. All this is duly supported.\n\nRegarding the opinion of the ICS, in compliance with the SOX Act,  the  administration  continuously  evaluates  and  assesses control issues with opportunities for improvement,  to determine their materiality and define possible action plans if they  are  relevant  to  internal  control.  For  observations, weaknesses  and  deficiencies  observed,  remediation  plans  are undertaken, monitored and supervised.\n\nThe  administration  has  the  economic  and  human  resources necessary for the proper implementation and operation of the ICS. Likewise, the governance models that allow an articulated and  synergic  management  are  constantly  reviewed  and updated.  Accordingly,  in  2022,  we  began  to  implement  the advice of the independent third-party expert who carried out the review and diagnosis of the governance model of the risk and  control  functions.  Consequently,  the  Non-Financial  Risks Department and the Internal Control Policy were created, and the  internal  control  function  was  included  within  the  SOX structure, among other measures to continue evolving towards the best national and international practices and to mature the adoption level of emerging risks or practices.\n\nOur ICS has policies  and  procedures  consistent  with  the  size and  complexity  of  the  business  and  has  been  structured  to comply with the standards and best practices of the Committee of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission (COSO) in its 2013 version.\n\nThe  general  status  and  main  actions  developed  during  the period  evaluated  for  each  of  the  elements  of  the  ICS  are presented below.",

Therefore,  we  operate  under  the  law  and  aspire  to  the highest standards of ethics, integrity and anti-corruption.

These traits define our culture as an organization and motivate and guide our actions. To promote these traits, we defined the behaviors expected and not tolerated in our employees' actions, based on a compliance approach.\n\nWe have made efforts to strengthen the culture of disclosure and ethical  reasoning  regarding  conflicts  of  interest,  participation  in boards of directors and third-party committees, access to privileged information, gifts and invitations, sponsorships and gifts.

We also resolved doubts about the Code of Ethics and Conduct guidelines.\n\nTo improve the points of contact, strengthen self-management and focus awareness and culture strategies on employee consultations, a more robust taxonomy was established to facilitate  the  analysis,  consultation  and  custody  of  information.  In  addition,  ethical reasoning tools were created for inadvertent use of privileged information and participation in  boards  of  directors  and  third-party  committees,  which  provide  elements  for  the identification of situations contrary to the Code of Ethics and Conduct or ethical dilemmas in decision-making.",

Hence, roles and responsibilities of the different risk areas and the other lines will be aligned with the provisions of the SOX Act and the Chapter of the Basic Legal Circular - C.E 029 of the Internal Control System, ensuring compliance.\n\nIn  2022,  Bancolombia continued to strengthen its risk governance model as a key element  in  their  comprehensive  management.  This  framework  includes  the identification  of  the  different  risks  to  which  the  Organization  is  exposed,  the definition of roles and responsibilities of each of the lines in relation to these risks and the association of the areas that each of the roles plays. The framework promotes a risk management culture through self-control, self-management and self-regulation.\n\nAdequate  structuring  in  the  three  lines  and  their  proper  functioning  avoids  the existence  of  gaps,  unnecessary  duplication  of  efforts  and  provides  greater possibilities to achieve adequate management through the interaction between the business and support units and the control and prevention units.

Among them are the need to manage the non-traditional risks to which the organization is exposed, and to strengthen the risk management culture.\n\nThe  strong  volatility  in  the  markets,  both  in Colombia  and  globally,  caused  by  the  monetary contraction policies of the main Central Banks to control  inflation  and  the  political  uncertainty generated  increases  in  the  market  and  interest rate  risk  exposure,  leading  to  the  adjustment  of internal  policies  to  continue  to  meet  our  clients' needs. In addition, strong competition for stable deposits  increased  the  cost  of  funds,  putting pressure on the net interest margin and decreasing liquidity levels due to portfolio growth.\n\nFrom the credit risk front, management in Grupo Bancolombia  was  focused  on  monitoring  and knowledge of the client and its environment, while adjusting risk appetite policies, generating strategies  for  a  better  portfolio  recomposition and  implementing  anticipated  and  integrated actions in all stages of the credit cycle. This was supported  by  the  development  of  new  models, methodologies  and  tools  that  leverage  the Grupo's  strategies  in  each  territory  in  which  we operate, in an agile, timely manner and backed by positive results regarding portfolio size and credit quality compared to the previous period.\n\nTo meet the new challenges, in 2022, the Corporate Risk Vice-Presidency developed initiatives and/or projects to leverage the organization's strategy, among which the following stand out:\n\n- \u00b7   Third-party solutions to experiment/complement the current risk ecosystem: with  this strategy we seek to improve our origination and collection models, through new market solutions,  deepening  our  understanding  of  underserved  clients  and  enhancing  our knowledge of clients through new information.\n- \u00b7   Technological  and  cyber  risks: in  2022  we  made  progress  in  the  identification  and management  of  cybersecurity  risks  in  suppliers,  technological  components,  COBIT processes,  monitoring  compliance  with  baselines,  vulnerability  assessment  both  on premise and in the cloud, among others.\n- \u00b7  Model risk: in 2022 we made progress in the development of validation guidelines, in the quantification of inherent risk, in the update of a new policy and in the evaluation of tiering for the Risk Vice-Presidency's model inventory, among others.\n- \u00b7  Evolution of the operational risk ecosystem: in 2022, we introduced a new operational risk management  solution,  which  leveraged  our  transformation  roadmap  development.  We also incorporate in this solution methodologies that support the management cycle and integrate capital methods and synergies with other related programs such as SOX, internal control or segregation of duties.\n- \u00b7 Application  Lifecycle  Management  (ALM): to strengthen  the  interest  rate  risk management processes of the banking book and liquidity, which are even more relevant in the current context of high inflation levels, in 2022 we implemented in Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala an application with international standards to strengthen these risks measurement.",

        "page_content": "## The following is a summary of risk management for each area:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Credit Risk\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022 there were few economic and social restrictions in the different markets where Grupo Bancolombia operates, compared to previous quarters. This resulted in lower  contagion  rates,  an  increase  in  Covid-19  vaccination  schedules,  and  the  generalized dynamism of the various local economic sectors. The Bank generated definitive solutions for clients affected by the pandemic, most of whom received financial relief in 2021.\n\nIn 2022 there were uncertainty scenarios mainly associated with presidential elections in the case  of  Colombia  and  El  Salvador,  and  alerts  about  regulatory  changes  from  the macroeconomic and political environment. The above, together with the international context with a possible world recession, conflicts between nations, interruptions in the transit and supply of goods and the accelerated increase in inflation, made it necessary to constantly monitor  our  clients  and  the  economies  where  we  operate.  In  this  sense,  we  maintained  a proactive credit risk management through the monitoring and accompaniment of clients and portfolios, the evaluation of the conditions and particular requests of each one of them, as well as the development of methodologies, tools and models that optimize debt collection.\n\nIn 2022, activities were developed to optimize the risk management of the entire credit cycle, including the following:\n\n## \u00b7 Origination\n\nWe were able to leverage the Grupo Bancolombia's strategies through the incorporation of new  information,  the  development  of  new  models,  policy  feedback  and experimentation.\n\nTo support the development of the people business strategy, we developed models and methodologies to support the pre-approval processes and the proactive granting of credit solutions  to  our  clients.  These  developments  contribute  to  the  efficiency  of  credit processes and substantially improve customer responsiveness. In this regard, we highlight the progress in the use of new non-traditional and sectorial information to improve the methodologies for estimating payment capacity, taking advantage, for example, of the use  of  transactional  information  and  its  usability  in  risk  scoring  models.  In  Central American banks, we highlight progress in process automation.\n\nWith  sectoral  risk  management  we  unified  the  risk  vision  in  the  different  economic sectors,  managing  to  participate  in  the  market  with  better  strategies  and  using methodologies  and  tools  to  carry  out  a  more  comprehensive  management.  With  the sectoral components of credit risk management, we seek to better understand cycles and anticipate with better decisions, manage and prevent current and potential portfolio risk, model  future  scenarios  and  optimize  risk  models  including  sectoral  impact.  For  this purpose, we have ratings, policies and sector diagnostic templates, which help us to focus origination according to appetite. With this combined information, we have implemented strategies to recompose the portfolio and to increase the balance in the target market, at levels above 80% in the banks for legal entities.\n\nFor the business, corporate and SME business, we have developed automatic credit quota approval  methodologies  to  generate  efficiencies  for  commercial  and  credit  teams  and provide timely approval of credit limits available to customers. At Bancolombia, 45% of these  limits  are  under  automatic  approval.  In  the  business  with  individuals,  we  have increased the number of clients enabled through pre-approvals and front-end responses, achieving 80% of disbursements through these modalities.",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Follow-up\n\nIn 2022, monitoring was the central focus of the cycle. Based on analytical models, processes and monitoring tools, we began to implement anticipated and integrated actions at all stages.\n\nDuring  the  year  we  were  able  to  develop  new  processes  and models  for  proactive  and  timely  client  management.  In addition,  we  made  progress  in  behavioral  models,  alerts  and early estimation of variables, which include not only traditional information,  but  also  alternative  and  sector  information.  In these models we have 7.7% of personal banking customers and 29%  of  SMEs  and  corporate  banking  customers.  We  also generated  more  agile  and  timely  follow-up  processes  for  the portfolio, guarantees, covenants and advances.\n\nFor  follow-up  purposes,  we  use  sectorial  analysis  to  manage portfolios  affected  by  macroeconomic  variables  and  other situations,  obtaining  reports  that  alert  us  about  the  most affected economic sectors and allow us to evaluate the most representative companies in each one of them.\n\nLikewise,  we  monitor  the  concentration  risk  in  the  loan portfolio, since  problems  with  one  or  more  of  Grupo Bancolombia's  largest  economic  groups  could  adversely  and significantly affect its operating results and financial position. Therefore,  these  clients  are  monitored  monthly  and  their management is highly relevant, not only to comply with specific regulations, but also to achieve strategic management.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  total  outstanding  principal amount  of  the  Bank's  20  largest  economic  groups,  on  a consolidated basis, represented 12.4% of the Grupo Bancolombia's loan portfolio. No individual exposure represented more than 1.5% of the loan portfolio.\n\n## \u00b7 Recovery\n\nTo recognize changes in client risk across all segments and sectors,  we  employ  recovery-stage  portfolio  management methodologies and strategies. Monitoring and its prospective  elements  allow  us  to  have  a  strategy  to anticipate recovery.\n\nIn  2022,  progress  in  the  collection  models  and  in  the generation of pre-approvals, together with greater digitalization of the process, enabled self-management and allowed  us  to  obtain  positive  results  during  the  year.  In addition, through experimentation, we have developed new recovery schemes that focus on customer rebanking.\n\nAs a result of these strategies, we have around 200 thousand customers with early management to avoid defaults and an increase  in  the  population  with  recovery  alternatives  of 80.3%,  from  422  thousand  customers  in  2021  to  761 thousand  customers  in  2022.  Likewise,  we  continued  to make progress in both mass and individual portfolio sales and in the implementation of pre-approvals for restructuring in  Banistmo.  With  the  new  self-healing,  early  warning  and propensity  models,  significant  progress  was  made  in Colombia in recovery, mainly in the SME segment, with an increase of 55% compared to the previous year's recovery.\n\nIn  2022,  increasingly  predictive  analytical  models  were developed  with  traditional  and  alternative  information  to improve the quality of the client's qualification and have a greater coverage of qualified clients automatically, avoiding subjective judgments, obtaining greater agility and timeliness in the process. These models enabled us to take anticipatory  actions  aligned  with  strategic  decisions  at  all stages  of  the  credit  cycle.  The  models  are  monitored  and updated  periodically  and  are  under  permanent  study  for their  continuous  evolution  and  open  to  new  relevant variables that improve their prediction and disaggregation into increasingly specialized segments.\n\nIn addition, within the estimates of the portfolio provisions, the value of the collateral is considered as backing for the operations and its mitigation, considering that its physical and market characteristics are reflected in a fair value.\n\nExternal factors, such as market, macroeconomic, environmental and political factors, may have an impact on the value of the personal and real guarantees backing the Grupo Bancolombia's portfolio. For this reason, such factors are considered in the valuation of collaterals performed by external and independent entities with the experience and suitability required by the control entities, for the impaired portfolio with a frequency not exceeding one year.",

This was mainly due to the increase in Bancolombia's  commercial,  consumer  and  housing  portfolio,  in Banco  Agr\u00edcola's  corporate  business  and  in  BAM's  consumer portfolio, as well as the increase in portfolio balances in dollars due to the devaluation of the peso during the period under analysis.\n\nThe consolidated delinquency rate of the 30-day overdue portfolio indicator  was  3.55%  in  December  2022  compared  to  4.55%  in December  2021,  because  of  the  application  of  strategies throughout the credit cycle. This allowed us to implement actions in advance and consistent with the reality of our clients, significantly improving  the  client  experience  and  process  efficiency.  However, the consumer segment saw a slight increase in the overdue portfolio indicator due to macroeconomic effects, such as the increase in the CPI (consumer price index), and in interest rates.\n\nSimilarly, the 90-day overdue portfolio balance decreased by 27.5% between  comparable  periods,  generating  a  direct  impact  on  the 90-day overdue portfolio indicator, which closed at 2.5%, compared to 3.4% in the same period of the previous year.\n\nCumulative  provision  expense  for  2022  amounted  to  COP  3.8 trillion, an increase of 57% compared to the previous year, driven by higher expenses in the individual portfolio.

This was mainly due  to  the  growth  of  the  consumer  and  housing  portfolios, because of a better dynamism in personal banking in response to  the  growth  strategies  in  this  segment,  in  addition  to  the effect of the devaluation of the dollar against the Colombian peso.  The  30-day  overdue  portfolio  indicator  stood  at  2.9% compared to 3.2% at year-end 2021, driven by the decrease in overdue balances in the commercial segment, in contrast to the consumer segment,  which  presented  a  slight  increase  in  the indicator  consistent  with  the  expansion  of  this  portfolio. Coverage of the 30-day overdue portfolio ended at 160.7% in December 2022, compared to 165.3% in December 2021.\n- \u00b7 In Bancolombia Puerto Rico , the portfolio balance in Colombian pesos  showed  a  positive  fluctuation  of  7.2%.  However,  this growth was because of the devaluation of the Colombian peso against the US dollar, in contrast to a decrease in the balance of 11.2%  in  its  original  currency  (USD),  due  to  credits  and payments  made  by  customers.  Meanwhile,  the  overdue portfolio closed at 3.9% in December 2022 compared to 3.3% in December 2021.",

It also refers to the probability of unexpected changes in net interest income and economic equity value because of a change in market interest rates.\n\nIn  Grupo  Bancolombia,  market  risks  are  identified,  measured,  monitored, controlled and communicated to adopt timely decisions for their adequate mitigation  and  to  generate  greater  added  value  for  shareholders.  The guidelines,  policies  and  methodologies  for  market  risk  management  are approved by the Board of Directors, thus ensuring consistency and unity in the risk appetite among the Grupo Bancolombia entities.\n\n## Grupo Bancolombia\n\n## a. Instruments for Trading Purposes\n\nInstruments for trading purposes in the Grupo Bancolombia include fixed income, variable income, foreign currency and derivative products, whose management is aimed to maintain an investment portfolio to support liquidity and meet the needs of our customers, while maintaining a controlled risk profile.\n\nThe relevant risk factors for instruments held for trading purposes are interest rate risk,  exchange  rate  risk  and  stock  price  risk.  Interest  rate  risk  arises  from unexpected  changes  in  interest  rates  that  may  adversely  affect  the  value  of  a financial  instrument.  It  mainly  affects  debt  securities  and  derivatives.  Exchange rate risk refers to changes in the exchange rate of one currency against another and affects foreign currency positions. A long position in a foreign currency other than the local currency may result in losses if that currency depreciates against the local currency. Finally, equity price risk arises from adverse movements in market prices or expectations of future dividends that affect positions in shares, equity indices  or  derivatives  with  equity  underlyings.  All  these  market  risks  can  be partially or fully mitigated with derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps, relative value strategies and by taking non-directional positions.\n\nFor the management and control of market risks of trading activities in the Grupo Bancolombia,  two  Value  at  Risk  methodologies  are  used:  the  standard methodology established by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC, by its  Spanish  acronym)  and  the  internal  methodology  by  weighted  historical simulation. These two methodologies measure the maximum probable loss that a portfolio could have in a time horizon and with a confidence level. In our case, the internal methodology by weighted historical simulation uses a confidence level of 99%, a holding period of 10 days and a time window of one year or 250 daily data, obtained  historically  from  the  VaR  calculation  reference  date.  The  standard methodology established by Chapter XXI of the Basic Accounting and Financial Circular  (CBCF,  by  its  Spanish  acronym)  of  the  Financial  Superintendence  of Colombia  is  based  on  the  model  recommended  by  the  Basel  Committee  on Banking  Supervision's  2005  Amendment  to  the  Capital  Accord  to  Incorporate Market  Risk.  This  methodology  is  used  to  report  market  risk  exposure  to  the Financial Superintendence of Colombia and to measure the capital requirements of Grupo Bancolombia.",

        "page_content": "In addition, extreme scenario measurements or stress tests are performed to estimate potential losses that do not occur with a high frequency but are possible, replicating past crises or simulating hypothetical events. Expected Shortfall estimates are also made to measure the expected value of potential loss greater than the level set by the VaR. Unlike VaR, Expected Shortfall has the advantage of capturing the risk of large losses with low probability (tail risk).  Backtesting  is  also  performed  to  determine  how  accurate  the  loss forecasts are in relation to reality, which leads to adjustments to the VaR models if necessary.\n\nLikewise, to manage and control the market risk of trading activities, Grupo Bancolombia has a hierarchical structure of VaR limits that ensures that risk is not concentrated in certain asset classes and maximizes the diversification effect  of  portfolios.  These  limits  are  defined  by  company,  product  or risk-taking responsibilities. Loss alerts, stop losses and sensitivity limits are also managed, especially in derivative portfolios. The limits are approved by the Board of Directors, considering the size of the assets, complexity and volatility of the markets, as well as the risk appetite. In addition, they are monitored daily, and their excesses or non-compliance are reported to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee.\n\nIn  2022  the  exposure  to  market  risk  measured  with  the  standard methodology of the Financial Superintendence of Colombia ranged between COP 783,367 million and COP 1,059,312 million, with an average exposure of COP 892,583 million. Total exposure at year-end increased, driven by the risk of collective portfolios due to the increase in these assets for Bancolombia's book, concentrated in Fondo Colombia Inmobiliario (Colombia Real Estate Fund). This effect was offset by a decrease in the other risk factors, led by a lower level of interest rate risk due to the decrease in Colombian government public  debt  positions  and  a  derivatives  portfolio  with  a  lower  nominal position. Meanwhile, the share price factor recorded a lower level, driven by instrument devaluations. Finally, the exchange rate factor also recorded a lower level of risk at the end of 2022 due to lower exposure to the US dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe total variation of market risk and its risk factors, under the standard methodology of the Financial Superintendence of Colombia, is shown below:\n\n## December 2022\n\nIn millions of Colombian pesos\n\n| Factor                | End of the year   | Average   | Maximum   | Minimum   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest Rate         | 340,107           | 381,094   | 410,605   | 340,107   |\n| Exchange Rate         | 78,165            | 118,620   | 201,927   | 78,165    |\n| Share Price           | 85,345            | 98,401    | 105,263   | 85,345    |\n| Collective Portfolios | 387,952           | 294,468   | 387,952   | 225,401   |\n| Total VaR             | 891,569           | 892,583   | 1,059,312 | 783,367   |\n\n## December 2021\n\nIn millions of Colombian pesos\n\n| Factor                | End of the year   | Average   | Maximum   | Minimum   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest Rate         | 403,557           | 407,530   | 450,774   | 347,163   |\n| Exchange Rate         | 88,477            | 82,247    | 98,848    | 63,375    |\n| Share Price           | 99,895            | 96,543    | 103,187   | 91,944    |\n| Collective Portfolios | 225,373           | 221,810   | 225,892   | 216,153   |\n| Total VaR             | 817,302           | 808,130   | 862,101   | 743,910   |",

        "page_content": "## b. Instruments for purposes other than trading\n\nGrupo Bancolombia maintains non-trading instruments such as loans, time deposits, checking and savings accounts, which are recorded in the Banking Book. The market risk management of the Banking Book is focused on increasing the economic value of equity,  contributing  to  the  generation  of  recurring  profits  with  a  controlled  risk profile.\n\nThe  relevant  risk  factor  of  the  Banking  Book  positions  is  the  interest  rate  risk (probability of unexpected changes in net interest income resulting from a change in market interest  rates).  Changes  in  interest  rates  affect  the  Bank's  income  due  to differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities. Another risk factor affecting the banking book positions is the equity price risk of the investments held by Investment Banking, as a Financial Corporation, directly and through its affiliated companies, in structural equity investments. Exchange rate exposures arising in the Banking Book are transferred to the Treasury Book to be managed.\n\nFor  the  management and control of market risks of  non-trading  activities,  Grupo Bancolombia uses a comprehensive approach, with a short-term vision, measuring the sensitivity of the net interest margin over a one-year horizon, and a long-term one,  estimating  the  impact  on  the  economic  value  of  equity  through  different scenarios. Levels of alerts are also defined to monitor and control the interest rate risk of the positions in the Banking Book, which are periodically reported to Senior Management.\n\nMarket  risk  management  of  positions  in  the  Banking  Book  is  carried  out  in  a decentralized  and  independent  manner  in  each  of  Grupo  Bancolombia's  banking entities.  This  management  is  carried  out  by  the  Asset  and  Liability  Management areas,  in  the  Financial  Vice-Presidency,  through  derivative  instruments  such  as exchange rate and interest rate swaps, mainly.\n\nGrupo Bancolombia has a positive sensitivity to increases in interest rates for the total financial margin. In terms of Market Value of Equity (MVE) sensitivity, the overall balance sheet positioning was such that the average duration of assets is slightly lower than that of liabilities. In 2022, there was an increase in the sensitivity of the net interest margin of COP 74,943 due to the increase in long-term liabilities, which, together with the increase in the average term of the portfolio, allowed the duration mismatch in the Grupo Bancolombia's balance sheet to show no significant changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing is the sensitivity for interest rate risk in legal currency (Colombian pesos) for Grupo Bancolombia as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021:\n\n| Legal currency                                | December 31, 2022              | December 31, 2021              |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| In millions of Colombian pesos                | In millions of Colombian pesos | In millions of Colombian pesos |\n| Asset sensitivity to 100 bps                  | 1,069,949                      | 859,122                        |\n| Passive sensitivity to 100 bps                | 545,911                        | 419,027                        |\n| Sensitivity of net interest margin to 100 bps | 515,038                        | 440,095                        |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing is the sensitivity for interest rate risk in foreign currency (US dollars) for Grupo Bancolombia as of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021:\n\n| Foreign currency                              | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| In thousands of USD                           | In thousands of USD | In thousands of USD |\n| Asset sensitivity to 100 bps                  | 84,883              | 77,106              |\n| Passive sensitivity to 100 bps                | 71,737              | 55,786              |\n| Sensitivity of net interest margin to 100 bps | 13,146              | 21,320              |",

The balance sheet also showed a significant increase in fixed-rate indexations and in the Reference Banking Indicator with terms of over one year, considering the Bank's asset and liability management strategy in accordance with the evolution of market rates. Thus, there were no rate mismatches that could have a negative impact on the margin and, on the contrary, they favored its performance positively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe fair value of each of Bancolombia's balance sheet positions is presented below:\n\n## December 31, 2022\n\nBook value\n\nFair value\n\nBook value\n\nFair value\n\nIn millions of Colombian pesos\n\n| Assets                                                                    |             |             |             |             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Debt securities, marketable investments and pledged financial assets  (1) | 6,916,719   | 6,916,719   | 11,948,226  | 11,948,226  |\n| Debt securities available-for-sale investments  (1)                       | 2,590,622   | 2,590,622   | 2,515,927   | 2,515,927   |\n| Debt securities held-to-maturity investments, net  (1)                    | 3,450,225   | 3,382,219   | 3,099,323   | 3,062,252   |\n| Equity instruments  (1)                                                   | 171,808     | 171,111     | 172,424     | 172,377     |\n| Financial derivatives  (1)                                                | 4,860,893   | 4,860,893   | 2,429,598   | 2,429,598   |\n| Loan portfolio and financial leasing operations  (2)                      | 168,203,995 | 152,905,956 | 139,105,688 | 146,483,664 |\n| Investment properties  (3)                                                | 449,253     | 449,253     | 216,229     | 216,229     |\n| Total Assets                                                              | 186,643,515 | 171,276,773 | 159,487,415 | 166,828,273 |\n| Liabilities                                                               |             |             |             |             |\n| Customer deposits  (4)                                                    | 156,480,283 | 155,160,442 | 138,702,086 | 139,556,437 |\n| Interbank  (5)                                                            | 482,766     | 482,766     | -           | -           |\n| Repos (5)                                                                 | 156,174     | 156,174     | 658,554     | 658,554     |\n| Financial derivatives  (1)                                                | 4,717,408   | 4,717,408   | 1,950,544   | 1,950,544   |\n| Financial obligations  (6)                                                | 14,161,087  | 14,161,087  | 9,022,340   | 9,022,340   |\n| Debt securities issued  (7)                                               | 15,209,620  | 14,632,729  | 15,640,558  | 16,231,707  |\n| Preferred shares  (8)                                                     | 584,204     | 350,978     | 584,204     | 604,025     |\n| Total Liabilities                                                         | 191,791,542 | 189,661,584 | 166,558,286 | 168,023,607 |\n\n## December 31, 2021",

Total exposure increased mostly due to the increase  in  market  risk  in  the  collective  portfolio  factor, mainly due to the higher investment in the Fondo Colombia Inmobiliario  (Colombia  Real  Estate  Fund).  This  effect  was offset by the other risk factors, which decreased compared to the end of 2021.\n\nThe  interest  rate  factor  decreased  by  18.6%  due  to  the portfolio's  lower  exposure  to  local  government  debt securities. The exchange rate factor decreased by 20.8% due to a lower net exposure to the US dollar. This was followed by the share price factor, which decreased by 33.4%, driven by devaluations in local market equity investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe total variation of market risk and its risk factors, under the Financial Superintendence of Colombia's standard methodology, is shown below:\n\n## December 2022\n\nIn millions of Colombian pesos\n\n| Factor                | End of the year   | Average   | Maximum   | Minimum   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest Rate         | 255,623           | 297,926   | 335,382   | 255,623   |\n| Exchange Rate         | 34,907            | 77,647    | 160,751   | 34,907    |\n| Share Price           | 17,247            | 25,615    | 30,477    | 17,247    |\n| Collective Portfolios | 368,227           | 273,485   | 368,227   | 201,599   |\n| Total VaR             | 676,004           | 674,673   | 841,538   | 559,381   |\n\n## Diciembre 2021\n\nIn millions of Colombian pesos\n\n| Factor                | End of the year   | Average   | Maximum   | Minimum   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest Rate         | 313,993           | 316,830   | 358,922   | 260,531   |\n| Exchange Rate         | 44,069            | 36,605    | 51,082    | 18,827    |\n| Share Price           | 25,900            | 27,152    | 27,950    | 25,900    |\n| Collective Portfolios | 200,554           | 193,061   | 200,554   | 187,132   |\n| Total VaR             | 584,516           | 573,648   | 630,130   | 517,160   |",

A negative sensitivity denotes a greater sensitivity of the liability and therefore a negative impact on the net interest margin. In the  case  of  an  interest  rate  fall,  the  behavior  of  the  net interest margin would be opposite to that mentioned.\n\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  net  interest  margin  on  legal  currency positions given positive and parallel variations in interest rates of  100  basis  points  was  COP  516,327.  The  variation  in  the sensitivity of the net interest margin between December 2021 and December 2022 is due to the increase in the variable rate portfolio balance.\n\nMeanwhile, the sensitivity of the net interest margin on foreign currency positions decreased to USD 4 million with respect to December 2021 considering the reduction in the balance  of rate-sensitive bonds and CDTs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assumptions and limitations\n\nThe sensitivity of the net interest margin was calculated based on the term at repricing: (a) considering only the contractual conditions of the current operations, (b) the amounts maturing in a period of less than one year under the assumption that they will be placed again at market rates for the sensitivity of the fixed rate balance and (c) the changes in the interest rate occurring immediately and in parallel in the yield curves of the assets and liabilities.",

Situations such as downgrades in the credit ratings of the Bank and its subsidiaries would increase the Bank's cost of funds and hinder its ability to attract deposits or roll over maturing debt.\n\nFor  Grupo  Bancolombia,  liquidity  prevails  over  any  growth  and  profitability objective. Liquidity management has always been a fundamental pillar of its business strategy, along with capital, to support its balance sheet strength. Grupo Bancolombia's liquidity management model promotes the autonomy of the subsidiaries, which must be self-sufficient in their financing structure. Each subsidiary  is  responsible  for  meeting  the  liquidity  needs  of  its  current  and future activities, within a management coordination framework at the Grupo level. The metrics used to control liquidity risk are developed around common and homogeneous concepts, but the analysis and adaptation is performed by each subsidiary.\n\nMeasures to control liquidity risk include the maintenance of an investment portfolio to ensure a liquidity reserve and the definition of early warnings and liquidity limits to proactively assess the Grupo's exposure level.\n\nThe methodologies used for liquidity risk control include liquidity gaps and stress  scenarios.  Liquidity  gaps  measure  cash  flow  mismatches  of  assets, liabilities  and  off-balance  sheet  positions,  separately  for  legal  and  foreign currencies. Regulators' models are applied, in which contractual maturities are used. Internal models are also applied, in which cash flows are adjusted by implementing  different  indicators  to  reflect  a  more  realistic  cash  flow behavior.  Structural  liquidity  is  also  measured  by  monitoring  the  available stable funding and its coverage against the required stable funding. For this purpose, we use the regulatory models and the standards established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision regarding the NSFR, adjusting it according to the stability characteristics of our deposits.\n\nThe policies, limits, processes, methodologies and tools for the evaluation of liquidity risk exposure are periodically validated to establish their relevance and functionality, and to adjust them as necessary. The market and liquidity risk areas prepare daily, weekly and monthly reports to monitor the evolution of liquidity risk exposure levels and the established limits and alerts, and to support the decision-making process.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This has been driven by supply  chain  difficulties,  the  Chinese  government's  zero  tolerance  measures  on Covid-19, and the emergence of new geopolitical tensions, such as the Russo-Ukrainian War. This  conflict  has  generated  difficulties  in  the  process  of  port  decongestion  and increases in energy raw material and agricultural commodity prices, segments in which Ukraine and Russia together have a significant share in world production and trade.\n\nThe natural response by central banks has been a monetary tightening unprecedented in recent  decades.  As  a  result,  the  international  and  local  financial  context  of  the economies in which Grupo Bancolombia operates has tightened significantly, causing a sharp economic slowdown to be expected in 2023.\n\nThis context implies challenges for the financial sector and its clients: higher interest rates will put pressure on the financial stability of many companies and will discourage the demand for financial resources, while the weakening of the economy's dynamics may lead  to  a  moderation  of  income  and  payment  capacity,  which  may  increase  the  loan portfolio's maturities. In the case of households, income may also be affected by a weak labor market.\n\nGrupo Bancolombia actively manages credit risk, including the incorporation of different macroeconomic  scenarios  in  the  provision  calculation  models.  In  addition,  Grupo Bancolombia has maintained a constant analysis and monitoring of the sector to identify customers potentially affected and with this, periodically review the evolution of their individual situation in the different forums, taking alternatives, if necessary, to support them in their business development and management of the situation.\n\nSo  far,  no  significant  supply  problems  have  been  detected  at  the  customer  level. However, continued inflationary pressures, resulting from this context, will become a challenge for customers in 2023, expecting more flexible anti-Covid-19 measures from the Chinese government.\n\nWe  also  highlight  the  adoption  of  Bitcoin  as  legal  currency  in  El  Salvador  and  the eventual  issuance  of  public  debt  in  this  cryptocurrency.  This  would  expose  the government's liabilities and payment commitments to the behavior of this asset, which could represent risks to the country's financial stability.\n\nTo date, Bitcoin adoption among businesses and households in El Salvador remains low, reducing the magnitude of the potential risks to which the country is exposed in the short term. Although there may be an impact on the overall economy, there is currently no significant exposure of the financial system to crypto assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These risks are managed based on the  analysis  of  processes,  technologies,  suppliers,  remote  work  methods,  cloud infrastructure, agile development, among other aspects that the organization identifies as generators of gaps that could expose the Grupo to internal or external threats and that, if they materialize, could generate high economic and reputational impacts for the organization or its customers.\n\nThe  development  of  products  and  services  on  the  Internet,  the  growth  of  services supported by suppliers, the generation of new alliances and the speed with which new vulnerabilities and new attack methods emerge, have represented in 2022 a continuous challenge  of  investment  in  cybersecurity  controls  and  a  synchronized  work  between technology, cybersecurity, business operation, management of contracts with suppliers, risk and audit areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Model Risk\n\n## Risk 3 - Business\n\nIn  recent  years,  the  use  of  mathematical  and  statistical  models  has  spread  rapidly  in different areas of Grupo Bancolombia. The use of these models brings benefits such as objectivity, automation and efficiency in decision-making, but also entails costs related to the resources required for their development and risks due to design or use failures.\n\nModel  risk  is  defined  as  the  potential  adverse  consequences,  including  economic  or reputational losses, of incorrect or misused model-based decisions. These can lead to a negative  impact  on  the  implementation  of  business  strategies,  risk  identification  and measurement, and compliance with internal or external limits, among others.\n\nThe  greatest  risks  arise  from  three  main  sources:  deficiencies  in  data  availability  and quality,  possible  methodological  errors  in  the  model  design  such  as  volatility  in  the estimates, and inappropriate use of the model, for example, due to its application outside the definitions and populations foreseen.\n\nSince many of the organization's processes use analytical models, the rise and relevance of this risk management is increasing, therefore Grupo Bancolombia is working on strategies for  its  identification  and  monitoring.  Currently,  model  risk  management  is  performed throughout  the  entire  life  cycle  of  an  analytical  model,  through  the  dissemination  of policies, guidelines and controls for each cycle stage. To this end, there is an inventory of models, with independent validation of the models prior to their use, with monitoring of performance metrics and alerts generation, and with the withdrawal of the model when its performance is not adequate or when its original use is no longer relevant, as well as the creation of roles and responsibilities.\n\nThe Risk Vice-Presidency has a Model Risk Policy with a high coverage in the independent validation  of  models.  The  other  vice-presidencies  are  in  the  process  of  defining  and disseminating minimum requirements for good practices in risk management.",

Since the campaign, the new government presented a political agenda that could have a future impact on capital-intensive industries,  such  as  the  development  of  the  country's  infrastructure.  Likewise,  some announced structural reforms, such as the pension reform, could have a material effect on the capital markets. The new vision of the country embodied in the public policies of the National Development  Plan  of  the  current  four-year  term,  together  with  the  social  and  economic difficulties  generated  post  pandemic,  and  the  growing  demands  for  financial  consumer protection standards among legislators, regulators and courts, could result in additional costs for the financial activity and operations of the country's financial entities.\n\nFinancial regulations in Colombia, in the jurisdictions where Grupo Bancolombia operates and in international standards may have a significant effect on the Bank's business, operations and financial results reporting. Regulation may change frequently, and its implementation may have an adverse effect on the Bank's business.\n\nFrom  the  prudential  perspective,  no  major  adjustments  are  expected,  since  in  2022  the Government completed the stage of issuing the regulations to achieve convergence to Basel III international  standards.  This  was  done  with  elements  such  as  capital  adequacy requirements (from 2021), the adoption of the concept of Large Exposures (LEX) [1], the establishment of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and the recent incorporation (within the Comprehensive Risk Management System) of the requirements for interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB).\n\nThe  eventual  materialization  of  initiatives  presented  in  the  past  to  impose  restrictions  or intervene in financial rates could result in additional operational costs. Prohibiting or limiting (including through price limits) from regulating or supervising market dynamics restricts the supply capacity and the exclusion of certain customer segments, due to product or service charges that could be introduced in the future.\n\nFinally, the effects on clients in sectors impacted by indirect regulation would put new risks of these industries in financial markets, with repercussions on financial or capital market activity.\n\nTherefore, Grupo Bancolombia has different actions to manage these risks strategically, in advance and with a long-term vision:\n\nPermanent  monitoring  of  the  political,  regulatory  and  normative environment, to measure impacts and opportunities\n\nThe application of identification, valuation and mitigation methodologies for political and regulatory risks.\n\nThe  use  of  reputation  and  trust  management  methodologies  with different stakeholders.",

The current outlook is much more negative than it was during the pandemic, there is a decline in hope and an increase in uncertainty. Similarly, the Data News Report stated that 72% of audiences in countries such as Colombia use social networks such as Facebook and WhatsApp to get information, accelerating the impact of fake news in this type of channels, which is difficult to control. According to data from the Observatory of Digital Media Research at CEU Cardenal Herrera University in Spain, fake news is 70% more likely to be shared or retweeted than real news, because they are perceived as novel and provoke disruptive emotional management.\n\nIn  line  with  the  above,  it  has  been  evidenced  that  the  level  of  digital  conversation  towards  Bancolombia  has multiplied up to 400% in the last two years in networks such as Twitter, in addition to what is published by traditional and alternative media on the organization's behavior. In addition, some issues have been identified related to biased and inaccurate information or the use of satire and humor, which are sometimes fake news, to influence the behavior of the groups involved. Manipulated, invented, misleading and/or false content predominates, and information is multiplied minute by minute, not by official voices but by users telling what happens to them in their daily lives: according to Google, in one minute more than 6 million searches are made and on Twitter about 600 thousand tweets are published.\n\nTherefore, the risk of finding fake news and/or disinformation in the media or social networks related to the brand, the company or any of its leaders is increasing and the organization is working to identify and combat it. Today we have a risk management model with reputational impact, in which we monitor related performance indicators and the control environment to determine the criticality of the exposure. In addition, an observatory was created to monitor the conversation about the brand with variables such as volume, tone and reach.\n\nAs containment strategies, we have channels such as the Verified Information Center, a platform where employees can share and report information associated with the organization to know its validity, thus ensuring the timely content management related to the brand.

With the relaunch and its expansion into purpose-driven  businesses,  we  expect  to  increase  depth  by  an additional 15%.\n\nWe  built  a  solution  for  our  micro-entrepreneur  and  self-employed clients who require financing for their businesses, at rates lower than the policy rates, with funds from Banc\u00f3ldex (development entity).

As  part  of  this,  we  participated  in  several  SME financial  fairs  to  promote  our  product  portfolio  and  learn  first-hand about our clients' needs to continue working to build a better country and a more egalitarian and plural society in terms of opportunities, and thus materialize our purpose of promoting sustainable development to achieve the well-being of all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Businesses and Independents\n\nWe create a value proposition in this sector, in which we have more than 1.8 million clients, distributed in 4 sub-sectors according to their income level (small, medium, large and plus). This allows us to understand their personal  and  family  needs,  as  well  as  those  of  their  businesses  or activities  to  support  them  in  the  long  term.  Thus,  we  expanded  the product  portfolio,  enabling  the  offer  of  personal  credit  cards  and improving the pre-approval process.\n\nWe  launched  \"Microcr\u00e9dito  +  El\u00e9vate\",  a  financial  education  program offered  together  with  the  Microcr\u00e9dito  Independiente  product,  to support the growth of entrepreneurs with business training tools for the proper management of their businesses and the loans they have with us. The  financial  education  program  lasts  six  months  and  includes personalized  tutorials  to  diagnose  the  business  and  provide  the necessary  topics  and  content  to  improve  sales  and  strengthen  the business.  Once  the  client  has  successfully  completed  the  consultancy and complies with the payment of its obligations, Bancolombia grants a rate reduction on its microcredit product.\n\nWe enable approved credit offers in mobile banking for employees and independent professionals in El Salvador.

In  the  subsidy  we have a 54% share with disbursements of COP 273,000 million in housing loans.\n\nTo contribute to compliance with risk policies for financing construction  projects,  we  officially  launched  the  Decenal insurance as a referral proposal for construction companies, in alliance with SURA and Seguros Mundial.\n\nThrough  Tu360Inmobiliario's  digital  solution,  we  disbursed COP 270,910 million in mortgage loans and housing leasing, allowing 1748 families to have access to their own house, thus materializing  our  purpose  through  the  construction  of sustainable  cities  and  communities.  At  Tu360Inmobiliario, customers  and  non-customers  can  obtain  approval  for  a housing  loan  or  leasing  in  minutes,  through  an  easy  and timely  experience.

These closings represent the largest photovoltaic package in Colombia financed through project finance. La Mata, located in the Department of Cesar, has a capacity of 108.3 MWp; while La Uni\u00f3n, located in the Department of C\u00f3rdoba, has a capacity of 144.5 MWp. The two plants together generate approximately 440 GWh per day, enough energy for the residential consumption of 230,000 people, equivalent to the size of a city like C\u00facuta. The sponsor  of  this  transaction  is  Solarpack,  a  Spanish  multinational  corporation  with  a  presence  on  four  continents.  Grupo Bancolombia, together with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), acted as co-sponsor of the financing, which amounts to COP 655,800 million, of which Bancolombia S.A. contributes COP 198,800 million through its green line.\n\nThis information includes financing under sustainable lines and rediscount lines in Colombia:\n\nTechnologies\n\nPhotovoltaic and small hydroelectric plants\n\nFunding amount\n\n743,000,000,000\n\n1,674\n\n1,300,000\n\n210,423\n\nPower (MW)\n\nAnnual generation (MWh)\n\nAvoided emissions (CO2tons)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Main aspects to highlight\n\n- Both  projects  will  receive  funding  from  the  UK  Sustainable Infrastructure Program (UK SIP) and the Dutch development bank FMO.

This meant a challenge from the point of view of financial analysis and structuring. 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Due to the particularities of both projects, a complex and robust package of contingent equity guarantees was established to cover the risks identified during the construction stage. This represented a negotiation challenge with a sophisticated sponsor (+700MWs  in  long-term  assets)  and  extensive  experience  in photovoltaic plant development (more than 1000MW).\n- The financing of each of the plants is separate from each other, which, although it doubled the effort in due diligence, technical analysis and contractual design, was achieved in a timely manner for the financing process.",

For example, through Sufi, we achieved a 20.9% share in hybrid vehicles.\n\nThrough the mobility  ecosystem,  we  support  people  throughout  their  mobility  life cycle,  integrating  the  vehicle  offerings  of  our  allies,  means  of  transportation  and Grupo Bancolombia's products.\n\nFrom the Tu360Movilidad Marketplace we assisted more than 3.5 million users in 5.5 million sessions, connecting them with more than 80 showcases of our partners and more  than  10  solutions  such  as  Renting,  Localiza,  Muverang,  Flypass  and  Sufi, disbursing approximately COP 72,140 million in credits for their vehicles. In 2022 we helped more than 1229 Colombians find the vehicle of their dreams.\n\nFrom the mobility ecosystem we understand that we must also meet the mobility needs of those who use other means of transportation. Therefore, from our public mobility solutions, we achieved a milestone in the digital transformation of the Metro of Medell\u00edn, allowing more than 430,000 people to recharge their metro card from their cell phones. This allowed these people to avoid lines and spend more time with their families. We also managed to mobilize more than COP 156,556 million, making 20% of its fare collection more efficient.\n\nIn 2022 we also partnered with the Bucaramanga Metrol\u00ednea mass transit system and connected to the MIO in Cali. In addition, 42 cab fleets incorporated digital tools so that Bancolombia customers could pay for services through QR Codes. Through this channel we reached more than COP 6,600 million and achieved the financial inclusion of a community of more than 45,000 cab drivers, of which we supported almost 1800 with loans for COP 1,600 million, according to their financial habits.\n\nWe are the first financial institution to have a direct connection with a transit agency to  carry  out  mobility  procedures  digitally.  Our  initiative  was  to  integrate  Sufi  with different mobility platforms, to facilitate the completion of procedures with the Traffic Secretariats for used vehicles.\n\n## Carbon Neutrality\n\nTo achieve compliance with the CO2 emission reduction goals defined by the company and the National Plan of the Ministry of Environment  and  Sustainable  Development,  Renting Colombia and Transportempo have defined a climate change policy and management plan with a series of mitigation actions focused on carbon neutrality.\n\nIn  2022,  Renting  Colombia  and  Transportempo  obtain  their second  recognition  for  their  participation  in  the  carbon neutrality  program  of  the  Ministry  of  Environment  and Sustainable  Development,  ratifying  their  commitment  to climate change mitigation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2023 we expect to obtain the operating license to have Nequi as an independent business.\n\nNequi closed the year with more than 14.9 million users, of which 3.5 million (one in four users) have Nequi as their  only  financial  service.

This component shows  whether  the  customer  is  an  active  saver  and  includes balances of savings and investment products with Bancolombia.\n\nDebt level: Analyzes  whether  the  level  of  indebtedness  of  the person is less than or equal to the 95th percentile of his or her segment. This component shows unhealthy levels of indebtedness and expenses and is only measured in Bancolombia debt products.\n\nOverdue  portfolio: Analyzes the fulfillment of financial obligations in debt products in Bancolombia (credit cards, loans, etc.).  Arrears  of  more  than  30  days  constitute  bad  financial behavior with repercussions for the client and the bank.\n\nInvestment product holdings: Analyzes  the  holding  of  at  least one  (1)  investment  product  in  Grupo  Bancolombia  (CDTs, fiducuenta, fidurenta, share funds, among  others). This component shows the level of sophistication of the client and, when analyzed in conjunction with the first component, helps to achieve savings goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor each variable the person fulfills, 1 point is awarded (otherwise 0 points), so the maximum number of points is 4. Therefore, the indicator provides a measurement by segment to identify the variables in which there is room for improvement and to make efforts from financial education to increase the indicator and the number of people who achieve financial well-being (obtaining 3 points or more in the 4 variables).\n\nThe goal established for the end of 2022 was 43.75% of customers with financial wellbeing and as of December the compliance was 43.79% for the personal, plus, preferential, social and employee segments that are part of the indicator, as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy 2023 this indicator will evolve and will have more sophisticated dimensions and variables that will enable a better understanding of customers and improve their financial well-being.",

Within this risk we incorporate and analyze two types of risks: physical risks and transition risks. In 2022, we made progress in the  evolution  of  our  methodologies  for  the  assessment  of climate physical and transitional risks.  This valuation was made in terms of credit, market and operational risks.\n\nAs part of our commitments to the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM), Bancolombia has defined climate change-related targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3. In 2020 we redefined our science-based target for Scopes 1 and 2, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario, and we committed to reduce our direct emissions by 73% by 2024 compared to 2019 emissions, with a challenge to achieve carbon neutrality in the countries where we operate by 2030. The definition of this goal was based on  the  Science  Base  Target  Initiative  (SBTi).  In  2022,  the reduction of CO2 emissions from our direct operation was 47%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo leverage the reduction of our financed emissions, we have set a financing target of COP 41 trillion by 2030 in investments for  the  decarbonization  of  our  clients  in  renewable  energy, technological reconversion, sustainable mobility and sustainable construction.\n\nAccording  to  the  science-based  reduction  targets,  the intensive  emissions  financed  (tons  of  CO2e  financed  per million Colombian pesos in portfolio) were 0.0491 including Scope 3 (0.0284 Scope 1+2).",

In this regard, some of the actions we have taken are the Environmental and Social Risk Assessment  for  projects  and  credits  in  activities  with  an  impact  on biodiversity established in our ESRA Policy. Likewise, our Controversial Issues Policy defines the activities that will not be financed due to their high impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems, and the conditions for financing and investment in economic sectors with high environmental and social impact.\n\nSince 2021 we are strengthening our biodiversity strategy, where the first step is aimed at measuring and managing our impact on forests. For this reason, we participated in the CDP Forest pilot, reporting on how we are managing these impacts from the risks and opportunities for our financing strategy  in  the  sectors  prioritized  by  the  initiative:  oil  palm,  timber, soybeans, livestock and rubber. Likewise, with CDP's support we will have the first analysis of our portfolio to identify impacts on forests.\n\nSimilarly, understanding that forests play an important role in biodiversity and climate change, in the framework of COP26, together with 30 global financial  institutions,  we  made  a  commitment  to  the  international community  to  actively  address  deforestation  by  2025  through  outreach, engagement  and  the  establishment  of  policies  towards  the  oil  palm, soybean,  livestock  and  leather  sectors  to  support  the  transition  of  the agricultural sector towards sustainable practices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We  seek  to  make  the  Colombian countryside  the  driving  force  of  prosperous,  innovative  and sustainable  development  for  our  country,  reaching  rural communities  that  for  decades  have  been  marginalized  from development  and  that  are  essential  for  food  security, diversification  and  strengthening  of  economic  activity,  job creation and closing gaps between regions.\n\nWe  learned  that  there  is  a  permanent  need  to  pay  greater attention  to  rural  territories,  to  act  in  a  pertinent  manner  to address  their  problems  in  a  systemic  manner.  We  understood that the challenges of education are not only solved by providing scholarships, although we are also intentionally bringing them to beneficiaries who otherwise would not have access to them in their territories.\n\nThrough  our  Scholarship  Program,  we  support  the  access  and permanence of rural youth in higher education, providing them with  mentoring  and  complementary  training  so  that  they  can enter  the  labor  market  and  strengthen  their  skills  and competencies to undertake productive projects. We facilitated access to higher education for 377 young people, coordinating actions and resources with different partners to provide greater and better support in the transition to their productive stage, with coverage in Colombia's 32 departments.\n\nThrough our financial education program, Cuentas Sin Cuento, we  develop  financial  skills  in  rural  communities  so  they  can better manage their money, make better decisions and progress.

In 2022, we had 1312  volunteers  sharing  their  knowledge  with  companies, entrepreneurs  and  young  people,  totaling  4447  hours  of specialized support. Also, 233 volunteers received 1400 hours of training,  which  enabled  them  to  pass  on  their  knowledge  and expertise to the communities.\n\nIn 2022 and hand in hand with Grupo Bancolombia, we supported 18 initiatives with social impact, mobilizing resources for COP 3,086,270,056 million and contributing directly to the materialization of our purpose.\n\nThese 365 days gave us the opportunity to give name and voice to hundreds of life stories that, through the support of our Fundaci\u00f3n, were  able  to  access  higher  education  through  a  scholarship  or improve their quality of life through financial education. We also supported dozens of companies that received specialized support or investment, which, in addition to generating economic growth, allowed them to positively impact their environments.\n\nWe  will  vigorously  continue  to  support  rural  areas  from  our different  capacities,  in  a  systemic  and  comprehensive  manner, promoting the development of innovative social and entrepreneurial ecosystems that encourage education, associativity,  productivity  and  formalization  as  ways  to  generate impact and sustainable development in our countryside.",

We generated more than 1,500 million in direct income for the nearly 1800  independents  visible  on  the  platform,  positively  impacting their finances and thus their well-being.\n\nThe platform has a base of more than 40,000 registered contractors who  benefit  from  an  ecosystem  of  services  in  which  external strategic  allies  also  participate  and  which  has  been  enriched through synergies with other projects of Grupo Bancolombia, Sura and Grupo \u00c9xito.",

This  was  an  evolution  in  our  work,  which  aimed  to enable more and more technology-based entrepreneurs, SMEs and  large  companies  to  transform  their  value  proposition, integrating  financial  services  into  their  channels  under  the Bancolombia  brand  or  their  own  brand,  to  provide  their customers  with  digital  experiences  in  a  faster,  easier,  more timely and efficient way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The following are the achievements of this path:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe designed and implemented the minimum viable product of our digital wallet service (BancolombiaPay), which allows third parties to offer their customers superior experiences leveraged on the strength of Bancolombia's financial products.

This product has 4 APIs, 6 operations and approaches with 2 third parties: Habi and Vecindario.\n\n## Consumer credit as a service\n\nWe designed  and  implemented  in  a  test  environment  a  new product  that  will  allow  Bancolombia  customers  to  use  their pre-approved  free  investment  credit  quota  as  a  means  of payment embedded in the shopping experience, directly on the merchant's website.",

We  also  developed  the  \"En  los Zapatos del Otro' (In the Other's Shoes) initiative, where close to  360  leaders  of  the  organization  experienced  empathy  by living  up  close  interactions  in  the  role  of  our  colleagues  and customers in high-impact experiences for them.\n\nWe amplified the customer's voice to 7 active mass channels: branches, management, correspondents, website, ATMs, Virtual Business Branch and Virtual Branch for Individuals. This allowed us  to  collect  close  to  1.5  million  responses  from  customers, who, from their perception, shared their difficulties and what they value most. Today we have 4000 employees connected to this  data  to  take  actions  to  continuously  improve  their experience.\n\nWe  made  progress  in  a  people-centered  design  to  solve  the right  problem  in  the  right  way,  with  the  Bancolombia  visual design system being one of the most important achievements by materializing design guidelines in our 6 brands and allowing us to reuse and contribute visual elements for the creation of experiences  in  our  digital  channels  in  a  scalable  way,  and ensuring consistency, speed and quality.",

We also evolved in our speed of  response  and  our  support  in  times  of  mass  affectation, perfecting protocols and improving service times by 93%, with a response and solution capacity of less than one day.\n\nIn 2023 we will continue to strengthen and evolve our capabilities, ensuring data-driven decision making, facilitating the empowerment of teams for the delivery of differentiated and loved experiences, building an end-to-end vision with shared allies and partnerships,  ensuring  the  closing  of  customer  pain  gaps  and anticipating the vision of success for the Bancolombia experience.\n\nThrough  self-management  tools  such  as  frequently  asked questions  and  customer  advocacy  initiatives,  we  adopt  a comprehensive  work  plan  to  minimize  friction.  As  a  result,  the volume  of  Queries,  Complaints,  and  Claims  QCC  (AQRs,  by  its Spanish acronym) received by December 2022 decreased by 11%, at a time when the volume of active clients has grown by 9% and the transactional volume of channels has increased by 36%.\n\nWe  designed  a  Centro  de  Experiencia  Adquirente  (Acquirer Experience  Center)  for  corporate  banking,  where  we  offer  first contact  solutions  for  the  acquiring  product  to  more  than  130 clients  in  these  sectors,  which  account  for  36%  of  the  product's turnover.  Corporate  customers  accounted  for  54%  (COP  16.5 trillion)  of  revenues  within  the  same  segment  and  business customers for 49% (COP 5.3 trillion).\n\nTo  achieve  greater  efficiency  in  customer  service,  we  have  an initiative for people who go to the branches to carry out procedures that can be solved through the telephone channel, which consists of scheduling a call with a contact center advisor in less than five minutes.  This  solution  has  benefited  15,249  customers,  with  a success rate of 74.28%, which translates into 5261 hours of waiting time freed up for the customer and 1600 hours of attention freed up for the commercial agent and the offices.\n\nWe transform the disbursement process to fulfill the dreams of our retirees  by  being  agile  and  timely  for  both  the  client  and  the commercial agent. This was achieved by reducing the advisory/sales time from 7 days to 1 hour, simplifying the signing and generation of documents,  all with an intelligent operation, through developments  to  connect  commercial  management  with  the disbursement area and the FOPEP (Public Pension Fund).\n\nAt Bam, we adopted strategies to improve customer retention, such as the Return Validator tool, which has allowed retention agents to have comprehensive solutions by segment to retain customers who want to cancel their credit cards. With this strategy we achieved a retention rate of 48%, the highest in two years.\n\nWe also designed and built the automatic flow of early cancellation alerts  for  Cr\u00e9dito  F\u00e1cil  and  Bamhogar.  This  allows  us,  through different channels, to identify in a timely manner all customers who intend to transfer their Cr\u00e9dito F\u00e1cil and Hipotecarios debt so that the  Conservation  Center  can  finally  retain  them.  Seventy-eight cases of Mortgagee alerts have been identified and 66 of them have been  retained  (85%).  In  Cr\u00e9dito  F\u00e1cil,  107  cases  have  been identified and 83 have been retained (78%).",

This initiative has allowed us to improve the experience of more than 240,000 customers monthly in the APP and Bancolombia A la Mano channels.\n\nApproximately 2000 customers may experience jams at the multifunctional ATMs and be left without access to their money at that time. However, using analytical models we refund their money in a maximum of one day (before the process took four days) generating tranquility and empathy with the client. We respond to the customer within one day and the first contact solution went from 36% to 91%.\n\nFrom the control,  monitoring  and  management  strategy,  we  develop  analytical models for fraud, channels and money desk. We implemented tools to get to know our customers much better, accompany them in their daily lives and identify their transactional habits to strengthen monitoring according to their behavior. In this way, we can generate alerts and reduce exposure to the risk of fraud, as well as improve the control environment for products and channels. With this, we have exhausted only 40% of the expected fraud loss.\n\nWe also designed a new accounts receivable monitoring methodology based on analytical models, which allows us to automatically identify atypical transactions, based on different variables, such as customers and type of accounts receivable. In this way, we mitigated a risk of COP 1,113 million with a total investment of COP 95 million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore, we promote hybrid work in an organizational context where flexibility, trust and well-being are our premises to attract and develop the best talent.\n\nTo  date,  we  have  12,936  employees  under  hybrid  work  schemes, representing 89% of our administrative employees. Additionally, these employees rate their hybrid work experience a 9.2 out of 10.\n\nIn  our  organization,  contributing  to  the  well-being  of  all  also  means being an ally in difficult times and working in a flexible environment that seeks harmony between personal, social and work life, where people find what they need to develop their life project as they dream it.\n\nIn this regard, we launched different initiatives to support employees in their personal development and growth, as well as in the most difficult moments of their lives. This is the case of the Sistema Contigo , a tool for those  who  are  going  through  an  urgent  situation  of  mental  health, violence  or  abuse,  to  access  psychological  support,  legal  advice  or external  support  networks  and  to  make  formal  complaints.  In  2022, more than 570 cases were attended, with a satisfaction  level  of  over 90%.  This  strategy  was  accompanied  throughout  the  year  by  an awareness campaign for respect for sexual diversity and, in general, for differences, which reached more than 20,000 employees. For example, we posted a chapter every month of 'Un caf\u00e9 diverso' (A diverse coffee) in different social networks, with conversations about HIV, empowerment, racism, diverse gender identities, female entrepreneurship, among others.",

Some of the topics that employees can find in this program are mindfulness, resilience, emotion management, burnout, growth mindset, how to understand the mind, among others.\n\nThinking  about  the  health  care  and  well-being  of  our employees  and  their  families,  we  have  delivered  857,464 experiences  and  benefits  to  99%  of  them.  These  include credits, assistance, insurance, psychological support, financial  counseling,  among  many  other  activities  for personal development, with an investment of COP 325,000 million pesos.\n\nIn this journey to develop talent and culture, at Bancolombia we believe that working for diversity, equity and inclusion is not only a responsibility we have with the environments in which  we  operate,  but  also  an  opportunity  to  strengthen ourselves.  Therefore,  for  more  than  5  years,  we  have  been developing  a  strategy  based  on  the  commitment  of  our leaders and consolidated with the establishment in 2022 of a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion department, which covers all Grupo  Bancolombia's  banks  in  Colombia  and  Central America.  Likewise,  we  have  the  challenge  of  working  to materialize a corporate policy that recognizes that all people, regardless  of  their  gender,  sexual  orientation,  abilities, cultural identity, among other characteristic factors, should have equal opportunities to freely promote their life project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe strategy  aims  to  transform  Bancolombia's  relationships with its different stakeholders: promoting equal opportunities for the personal and professional development of  employees  and  creating  a  work  environment  free  of discrimination  and  violence.  It  also  seeks  to  incorporate diversity as a criterion in value propositions and experiences for  customers,  mobilize  allies  and  suppliers  through  a corporate  community  that  shares  experiences  and  best practices,  and  generate  solutions  that  capitalize  on  the organization's knowledge, skills and capillarity to promote the autonomy and productivity of communities.\n\nGuided  by  these  4  objectives  for  Employees,  Customers, Suppliers and Communities, we took important steps in 2022 to promote women's leadership in all scenarios. Internally, we achieved 42% female participation in senior management, a figure that brings us closer to our target of 50% by 2025. To achieve  this,  this  year  we  worked  hand  in  hand  with organizations  such  as  Comfama,  CESA  and  ANDI  on mentoring  programs  that  offer  women  leaders  training opportunities and connect them with other women to expand their networks inside and outside the organization.\n\nIn addition, we maintained the proportion of women hired for the Vice-Presidency of Technology at over 20%, an indicator on  which  we  are  committed  to  continue  improving  by supporting  initiatives  that  motivate  more  women,  from  an early  age,  to  recognize  that  science  and  technology  can represent  opportunities  for  their  personal  and  professional development. For this purpose, this year we partnered with the She Is Foundation to take 35 girls from different regions of the country to experience a scientific immersion at NASA, through the 'She is an Astronaut' program.",

We also adjusted prioritization processes, budgeting, human processes such as selection, performance management and career plans. The way the teams in charge of generating business solutions interact was also modified. In 2022, this transformation allowed the launch of a new evaluation model based on objectives, skills and knowledge with a coverage of 99% of the organization and the support of 30 agile coaches in strengthening their role in change management and leadership.\n\nThis evolution also permeated our commercial network with a model that revitalizes and refreshes Bancolombia's physical network and its  dynamics.  This  accelerator  project  allowed  us  to  fulfill  our purpose,  provide  superior  customer  experiences,  materialize  the strategy and drive the cultural transformation of the organization through MovimientoB and L\u00edderB, with adoptions and expressions of new behaviors to refocus the delivery of financial and non-financial solutions  that  promote  sustainable  economic  development  to achieve  the  well-being  of  all.  This  was  achieved  by  evidencing client-centered  decisions,  implementing  greater  dynamism  and strengthening  extraordinary  performance  as  fundamentals,  and having integrity, human beings and sustainable growth as levers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Therefore,  amidst organizational  transformations,  we  renewed  the  value  proposition  for employees so that each one of them can say with pride and commitment: 'Bancolombia is  the  best  place  to  work!'  This  is  how  we  established  four pillars that define the work experience in the organization:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSense of contribution and purpose\n\n- 2 Well-being and harmony\n- 3 Personal and professional development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- A culture that makes a difference 4\n\nWe also know that to fulfill  our  purpose  it  is  necessary  to  have  the  best talent. For this reason, in 2022 we carried out different events and initiatives to consolidate our employer brand and position ourselves as one of the best companies to work for in the country, retain, build loyalty among employees with  key  skills  and  attract  new  professionals  in  strategic  areas  such  as technology, cybersecurity, design, analytics and artificial intelligence.\n\n## Some of these events were:\n\nBancolombia Tech, an experience of open knowledge in which more than 2700 employees and external took their skills to another level, learning about the topics that are trending in the  world  of  technology  through  7  cycles  of  webinars  with  15  speakers  (10  from Bancolombia  and  5  external)  who  talked  about  blockchain,  data  science,  software development, cybersecurity, open source and cloud.\n\nAceleraTI, an event created to contribute to the development of young talent specialized in technology in the Santanderes and contribute to strengthen the production network in the region to achieve sustainable development that promotes the well-being of all.\n\nOpen House Bancolombia, a hybrid event designed to connect university students with the organization's  executives  and  thus  maintain  our  position  as  one  of  the  most  attractive companies to work for in the youth segment. More than 2500 people took part in the event, which included 15 talks on topics such as technology, talent, marketing, design and business.\n\nTalento B, a program where we train passionate people in strategic knowledge such as data science,  cybersecurity,  experience  design  and  technology  through  participation  in  real projects and challenges of the organization, to turn them into the experts who will assume the  roles  of  the  future  in  Bancolombia.  To  find  the  best  talent  for  the  organization,  we defined 3 major categories to cover 23 challenges in the main cities of the country and we obtained a participation of 1328 people.\n\nAdditionally, in 2022 we continued with the strategy of loyalty and development of strategic talents  for  the  organization,  to  strengthen  their  competencies  and  skills  to  ensure  the succession  and  continuity  of  key  roles  for  the  Bank's  operation,  including  senior management. This year we invested more than COP 5,500 million in loyalty strategies.",

We develop skills for being, knowing and doing so that we can grow and reach the best version of ourselves.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor us, knowledge is an asset that arises from experience, collective construction, experimentation, improvement and interaction with others. Therefore, managing knowledge is our priority to enhance team performance and mitigate the impact of talent drain.\n\n## The learning strategy as a lever for the personal and professional growth of our employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTherefore,  we  defined  different  mechanisms  for  the democratization of knowledge, facilitating the evolution of profiles  and  their  enrichment  through  a  structured, intentional  and  comprehensive  offer  of  content  (schools, training  maps  of  the  vice  presidencies,  digital  strategies, scholarships  and  strategic  knowledge).  This  ensures  that employees, through the consumption of knowledge, impact their behaviors. For this reason, in 2022 we invested more than 1 million hours in training our employees, with a value of  more  than  USD  3,303,952.  Among  our  leaders,  93% acquired new knowledge and strengthened their skills in our Leadership Institute, close to 9000 employees attended our schools  and  98%  of  employees  completed  their  annual virtual training plan, with an average of 49 hours of learning.\n\n## Skills that will be necessary for\n\ntoday and for the future.\n\nThese academic programs are built together with high-level domestic and foreign institutions and the expertise of our employees,  to  take  advantage  of  internal  knowledge  and experience  in  specific  subjects,  thus  facilitating  coverage and efficiency.",

Thus, we have been able to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts directly related to our operations. Among the most relevant policies we have: Responsible Corporate Investment Policy; Diversity, Equity  and  Inclusion  Policy;  Policy  to  promote  healthy coexistence, gender equity; alignment of labor practices with SDGs and Due Diligence in human rights, among others.\n\nOur  fundamental  focus  remains  to  preserve  the  value  of human  dignity.
