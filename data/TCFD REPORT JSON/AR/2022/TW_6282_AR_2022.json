The ongoing war for over a year since the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict at the beginning of the year 2022 has intensified geopolitical risks, triggered energy and food crises, and raised supply chain and labor costs. In response to inflation, the US began raising interest rates in March 2022, with a total increase of 17 basis points for the year. Inflation remains uncontrolled, and the possibility of further rate hikes adopted by the US and various countries is not excluded. However, according to the IMF's forecast, global economic growth is expected to increase from 2.7% to 2.9%, and global inflation is expected to drop from 8.8% in 2022 to 6.6% in 2023, a justification that the IMF believes that the global economy has been on an uptrend. With the efforts of all employees, AcBel's revenue has grown positively for five consecutive years from 2018 to 2022. We hereby report sincerely AcBel 's 2022 operating results and 2023 business outlook to all shareholders.\n\n## 2022 Operating Results\n\nThe annual revenue in 2022 reached NT$25.321 billion, up by 15.6% from 2021. The annual net income in 2022 was NT$636 million and the earnings per share was NT$1.23, an increase of 5.7% compared to the same period of 2021. Although the mainland China area remained shadowed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first three quarters of the year 2021, AcBel yet strengthened its internal epidemic prevention measures, adhered to government's laws and regulations on anti-pandemic prevention at all times, and quickly responded to reduce the impact on production. Facing the ongoing material shortages, AcBel deepened communication with our supply chains and continued to follow up on raw material supplies to ensure  stable  supply.  On  the  other  hand,  AcBel  has  continued  to  upgrade  our  level  of automation, reduce reliance on human resources, and improve operational efficiency. All these efforts  have  stabilized  customer  confidence  in  AcBel  and  fostered  win-win  cooperation through difficult times.\n\nAcBel has been awarded a 'Gold Rating' in the sustainability assessment conducted by EcoVadis for two consecutive years, the assessment of which covers seven management indicators, across 21 sustainability criteria, in four themes: Environment, Labor & Human Rights,  Ethics  and  Sustainable  Procurement.  Moreover,    among  the  sustainability  award categories of the \"TCSA Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards,' the largest sustainability",

By leveraging our strong research  and  development  capabilities,  AcBel  has  successfully  expanded  into  emerging applications such as green energy and electric vehicles.\n\n## 2023 Operating Prospect\n\nOur business direction will focus on three major areas: power supplies, electric vehicles, and green energy. The consumer power supply market is facing adjustments in the demand of terminal  markets,  with  customers  prioritizing  inventory  liquidation  in  the  short  term. However,  Acbel  will  continue  to  maintain  close  cooperation  with  customers  by  strictly controlling  inventory  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  customers'  and  our  own  internal resources usage. The enterprise power supply market will continue to grow, driven by trends in industries such as servers, data centers, fuel cells, and storage devices. Acbel's power supply products are expected to achieve a sales target of 82,533 thousand units this year.",

An evaluation of targets for strengthening of the functions of the Board of Directors during the current and immediately preceding fiscal years, and measures taken toward achievement thereof:\n- (1) The Company has appointed external expert KPMG Taiwan to perform the 2022 external performance evaluation of the Board / individual board members.    Self-evaluation by the functional committees have also been executed, where the evaluation results have been listed in the board meeting announcements on March 8, 2023, which are published on the Market  Observation  Post  System  (MOPS)  and  the  Company's  website/Corporate Governance  Section (http://www.acbel.com) as reference for the investors and stakeholders.\n- (2) In order to actualize corporate social responsibility, establish superior governance system, align with global trends, and continuously stride towards sustainable development goals, the Company set forth the 'Sustainable Development Best-Practice Principles' on May 6, 2022.  And the Company further set forth the 'Sustainable Development Organizational Charter' on November 4, 2022, appointing 3 Independent Directors to serve as members of the First Sustainable Development Committee.    Sustainable  Development  Best-Practice Principles  are  published  on  the  Market  Observation  Post  System  (MOPS)  and  the Company's website/Corporate Governance Section (http://www.acbel.com).\n- (3) In order to actualize the advancement of Taiwan's Gender Equality Policy Guidelines, increase women's participation in decision-making, and strengthen structures of the Board, the Board proposed on March 8, 2023 to select one additional female Independent Director, which would bolster the gender and background diversities of the board members.",

The Company shall make provision or reversal for special surplus reserve from the remaining earnings as required by law or by the provisions of competent authorities. If there is still a balance, the Board of Directors shall draw up an earnings distribution plan for the balance and the undistributed  retained  earnings  at  the  beginning  of  the  period,  and  submit  it  to  the  board  of shareholders for a resolution on distribution.\n- The Company may authorize the Board of Directors to distribute dividends and bonuses, capital reserves or statutory surplus reserves payable in cash in whole or in part by a resolution of a majority vote at a meeting of the Board of Directors attended by two-thirds or more of the total number of Directors, and report to the shareholders' meeting.\n- The Company is at a stage of steady growth. In consideration of the Company's future capital needs and to meet the needs of shareholders for cash inflows, the annual cash dividend paid shall not be less than 50% of the total cash and stock dividends paid in the current year if there are earnings available for distribution after the Company's annual closing of the books.\n- 2.

The Company's Major lines of Business\n\nAs one of the top ten leading manufacturers of switching power supply in the world, AcBel Polytech Inc. is mainly engaged in the research and development, production and sales of power supply, which accounts  for  about  90%  of  the  total  sales.  With  professional  design  and  rich  manufacturing experience, the Company provides customers with high efficiency and energy-saving products and complete power management solutions.\n\nMain products consist of (1) consumer use power suppliers: applied to desktop computers, notebook computers, smart phones, smart home appliances, and others; (2) business use power suppliers: applied to servers, storage devices, networking and telecommunication, and others.    In addition, the Company is also actively expanding its developments in green energy, electric vehicles, and other emerging terrains.    The Company has also long been dedicated in the fundamentals of designing and manufacturing power suppliers.    In coordination with the global trend of international clean energies and government energy policies, the Company officially entered the industry of solar power plants (stations) in Taiwan in 2017.

        "page_content": "The advantages to use SPS include providing products with low loss, small volume, lightweight, which  is  in  line  with  the  development  trend  of  light,  thin  and  short  terminal  products  and energy-saving and environmental protection, and providing a wider range of external imputable voltages  than  an  LPS,  and  providing  the  performance  of  higher  power  density/conversion efficiency, all of which contribute to wider application scope. The scope of products includes chargers, rectifiers, converters, inverters and an Uninterrupted Power System (UPS).\n\nCurrently,  Taiwan's  SPS  manufacturers  are  facing  low-price  competitions  from  Chinese manufacturers within the personal computer and consumer electronic device charger markets; the environment is dire.    During the first three quarters in 2022, as material shortage was ameliorated, and as clients' orders were finally smoothly delivered after large amounts of backlogs occurred due to supply chain issues during the pandemic, we have finally welcomed prosperity in growth that has been unseen for many years.  However, during the fourth quarter, under the influence of clients' inventory backlogs and inflation, the overall industry showed declines varying from 20% to 30%; and the market outlook is still unclear.  With respect to application of the information center, as material shortage in 2022 has been ameliorated, deliveries in the first three quarters have also largely increased.  After the fourth quarter, following the concerns of rising interest rates, inflation, and economic recession, cloud customers grew conservative in capital expenditure and gradually  cancelled  or  postponed  information  center  expansion  plans;  service  lives  of  the equipment have also been extended.    Prospect for 2023 is also tending towards conservative - it is estimated that the market will only show single-digit growth.    In terms of development of 5G, the market  poses  relatively  strong  demands  on  edge  computing  servers  and  networking  and telecommunication products as a result of the tender opening of C-BAND in North America in 2021, expansions and needs for equipment changes by telecommunication companies, as well as the  Biden  government's  investment  in  fundamental  broadband  internet  infrastructures  per Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Under risk-avoidance constraint posed by the U.S.- China trade war, most clients are transitioning their orders to Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries.    Moreover, the Biden government signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022 to compensate domestic manufacturers in the U.S. and create regional supply chains, which have prompted electronics industry to successively proceed with supply chain rearrangements.  Taiwan, being an island of technology, carries its advanced semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, and the fully supported supply chains are thus able to respond to all emerging industries by offering comprehensive resolution  plans.    Along  with  globalized  supply  chain  layout,  Taiwan  is  far  from  losing competitive advantages in this wave of regionalized supply chain reassembly.\n\nYear  2022  has  certainly  introduced  the  era  of  Generative  AI.    Besides  DALL-E2  and  other drawing  related  products,  ChatGPT  launched  by  OpenAI  at  yearend  is  even  more  likely  to drastically change the search engine market dominated by Google over the years.    In response to the  edge  computing  needs  required  during  AI  model  training  and  inference,  besides  for  the OpenSource IT server and networking and telecommunication devices to be further applied on 5G infrastructures, with the large amount of power consumption from GPU cluster computing at the information, new-generation water-cooling heat dissipation and cabinet rack power with higher power  are  also  successively  introduced.    In  the  short-term,  hardware  demands  of  global information center is facing the challenge of unclear economic outlook and experiencing reduced growth, but in the long run, continuous growth is expected.    With stable growth of global server and telecommunication device markets, SPS manufacturers in Taiwan have all been strategizing their products to gear towards developments of servers, workstations, and power suppliers for the use of networking and communication devices in the recent years.  As this category of power suppler application is tending towards product standardization, and as Intel allies with HP and Dell, the leading server manufacturers, to promote mCRPS standardized powers, the standardization has led  to  low  market  entry  threshold  and  possibly  more  fierce  competition.    In  the  market  of low-level  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises,  some  Chinese  manufacturers  have  also  begun developing related products and entered low-price competition.  However, as U.S.-China trade war is heating up, Chinese manufacturer, e.g. Huawei, has been included in the Entity List by the U.S.  for  sanction.    5G  infrastructure  in  Europe  and  the  U.S.  and  the  market  of  data  center equipment have turned to procure equipment manufactured by European and U.S. enterprises due to information security factors.  It is expected that in addition to securing markets of low and middle level standardized products in the professional application fields of server, storage, and networking  and  communication  equipment,  Taiwanese  SPS  manufacturers  will  turn  to  open",

In  addition,  manufacturers are also changing gears from green energy that has been controlled  by  major  manufacturers  in  Europe,  U.S.,  and  Japan  and  devoting  in  product development,  hoping  that  with  the  extension  of  power  electronics  technology,  new  export opportunities can be found.\n\nThe infrastructure of a data center includes servers, switches, storage, routers, and communications power. In particular, the demand for power supply of routers and switches is growing continuously. In terms of high-end and mid-end power supply, while the power supply and power density are increasing, the Power Factor (PF), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and conversion efficiency of power  supply  has  become  the  basic  technical  indexes  of  power  supply.  Meanwhile,  new applications  such  as  IT  equipment  power  supply,  edge  computing  server  power  supply, cabinet-level power supply, integrated HVDC input, 48V DC input/output, PoE and integrated backup batteries applied to 5G infrastructure meeting telecommunication regulation requirements are the direction of technology development.\n\nIn the smart grid market, the demand for smart meters is increasing due to energy shortages and rising  environmental  awareness.  Teclast  is  also  accelerating  the  deployment  of  smart  meters, including meters, communication solutions and data processing platforms. And the Company has also started to deploy the market of smart meters in Southeast Asia, where the market is growing.\n\nThe Company integrates multiple smart solutions, such as energy gateways, renewable energy and energy storage equipment, and digitizes and visualizes all devices to generate various services creating a new business model. As a result, a number of energy management system (EMS) solutions have emerged on the market, offering an operating model in addition to device sales. In an era when everything is connected to the Internet, the digitization and intelligence of energy products are unstoppable.\n\nWith the development of AI artificial intelligence, 5G communication system, edge computing and cloud computing technology, and based on the overall strategy for innovation and development of the new generation of the data center, the requirements of high power, high integration, modular and  open  computing  architecture  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  design  of  data  center. Implementation of universal power hub and rack design can effectively reduce equipment cost. Our  upcoming  introduction  of  conduction  cooling  and  direct  liquid  cooling  will  satisfy  the high-density and high-power heat dispersing needs, and it will be the key development focus for our next stage..\n\n## (2) Solar farm industry\n\nIn 2022, all countries in the world proposed net-zero carbon emission transformation policies to promote industrial transformation, and 153 countries have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It is estimated that the sustainable industry market will drive US$90 trillion in business  opportunities  within  35  years.  The  United  States  intends  to  increase  solar  power generation to 40%, and is expected to invest two trillion dollars to \"rebuild a better future.\" Japan published the draft of Strategic Energy Plan, aiming to double the proportion of renewable energy power generation within 10 years, which will make Japan surpass Taiwan and become the biggest player of offshore wind power generation in Asia, and it's renewable energy market will continue to grow. Meanwhile, the European Union proposed a climate neutrality plan, which will impose a carbon tariff (CBAM) on energy intensive products imported into the EU from 2023. The first stage  will  focus  on  high-polluting  industries,  such  as  cement,  fertilizer,  steel,  aluminum  and electricity, and the second stage may include the electronics industry. .\n\nEnergy transformation drives the development of the green energy industry. Energy generation, energy storage, energy conservation and smart system integration have become the four major pillars of Taiwan's future renewable energy development. President Tsai Ing-wen announced that Taiwan will move towards net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Executive Yuan revised the \"Climate Change Response Act\", which will implement a carbon pricing system and impose carbon fees in 2023. The National Development Council will propose a net-carbon emission road map for Taiwan, promoting amendments of regulations and policy support from seven major aspects, i.e., wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, ocean nergy, hydrogen energy, energy storage and carbon sink. In response to the EU's carbon tariffs and the needs of sustainable development, the private sector has also begun to take action. Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan Cement, China Steel Corporation and other energy intensive industries have fully configured",

        "page_content": "renewable energy. Big electric furnace manufacturers, such as Fenghsin, Haikwang and Weichih, are actively installing solar photovoltaic equipment.\n\nAs of February 2023, transaction amount of Taiwan's green power wheeling is approximately 1.8 billion kWh, which translates to a growth of more than 3 times the amount in 2021.    Amidst the usage, more than 80% of the green power comes from onshore wind with the rest coming from solar  energy,  hydroelectricity,  and  marine  energy.    Currently,  private  power  plant  equipment capacity available to be contributed to the market is approximately 3GW, which accounts for nearly 20% of total equipment capacity and still poses room for further growth.  Following the government's active advancement of green energy development, we believe that the transitioned supply of green energy in terms of transaction amounts and equipment capacity will continue to grow in the future.    The National Development Council published Taiwan's Pathway to Net-Zero Emissions in 2050 at the end of March 2021; before 2030, a budget of nearly NT$900 billion will be put in before 2030, which would hopefully prompt private investments of over NT$4 trillion. Amidst the NT$900 billion budget, the portion that would reinforce the smart grid and energy storage system is approximately NT$207.8 billion.  There are three stages for the development process of energy storage.  The first stage 'Grid Energy Storage' will achieve supply-demand balance around 2025.    For the national policy's advancement of Taiwan's energy storage market, in addition to the 'large electricity consumer clause', there is also a comprehensive plan for smart grid, and the 2025 energy storage equipment installation goal is planning for it to increase from 590MW  to  1,000MW.    The  focus  of  the  second  stage  will  turn  to  complement  with  the weather-dependent renewable energy power plant energy storage.    And Behind the Meter energy storage at the plant and user ends have RE100 thrust, thereby posing development potential in peak-valley price difference and time-of-use rates.    Moreover, applications of energy storage and charging station can also be integrated for mutual usage.\n\nIn line with the \"New Southbound Policy\" that aims to link with local industries in Southeast Asian countries, the government has also established the 'System Integration Promotion Alliance (SIPA) Project Office' to encourage private sectors to export Taiwan's solar energy system in order to promote  downstream  integration  of  Taiwan's  solar  industry.  However,  due  to  the  impact  of COVID-19 on the global supply chain, more attention should be paid to the rising trend of installation costs caused by price fluctuation of raw materials and solar modules.\n\nIn the foreseeable future, the net-zero carbon emission path and domestic policy support will drive the renewable energy market. Taiwan should deepen its technological advantages, accelerate the transformation  of  the  energy  industry,  strengthen  the  supply  chain,  and  take  a  two-pronged approach to win international customers while driving the growth of the domestic market.\n\n## (3) Electric Vehicle Industry\n\nWith the rapid development of battery and automobile technology, it is possible to replace gasoline with electricity as the main source of power for vehicles. Electric vehicles are vehicles that use batteries as energy storage and power supply and are driven by motors. Electric vehicles can be divided into BEVs (battery electric vehicles), HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles), PHEVs (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles) and REEVs (extended range electric vehicles) according to different power supply methods and ratio. In addition, there are other vehicles, such as fuel cell vehicles or solar cell vehicles, that can generate energy on their own.\n\nFrom the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, to the United Nations Climate Change Conference, led by European countries, countries around the world have begun to have constructive discussions and systematic measurement standards on environmental protection issues, especially on tracking and measuring greenhouse gas emissions, use of renewable energy, energy efficiency and climate policy. The current global carbon emission target is 40% reduction from 2015 to 2025, among which the European vehicle target of 59 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer in 2030 is the most stringent. Governments have also gradually issued timetables for banning the sale of fuel vehicles. For example, Norway and the Netherlands are expected to completely ban the sale of new fuel vehicles in 2025; and Germany will only approve license for zero-carbon vehicles after 2030, and have internal combustion engine (ICE) banned on the road after 2050. Japan has raised its 2030 carbon reduction target from 26% to 46%, and will ban the sale of fuel vehicles in 2035. In response to these carbon reduction policies, large car manufacturers have increased the proportion of electric vehicles in their product lines in order to meet the deadline and limits of carbon emissions in various countries.",

In 2025, number of electric vehicles sold globally is anticipated to exceed 23 million, which in response to electrification penetration rate via statistics may translate to a growth rate of 30%.    And an annual compound growth rate of 30% is still able to be maintained for the next three years.    Observing from mid- and long-term perspectives, electric vehicle market is expected to continue expanding at a rapid pace.\n\nAccording to the Global EV Outlook released by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of electric vehicles, electric buses, electric lorries and electric trucks is expected to reach 145 million in 2030. The IEA believes that the number of electric vehicles in the world will continue to increase and is expected to reach 230 million in the next 10 years with vigorous promotion of international energy and climate goals by the governments around the world.\n\n## 2. The Links between the Upstream, Midstream, and Downstream Segments of the Industry Supply Chain\n\n## Links between upstream raw materials and the industry\n\nThe main raw materials of switching power supply can be broadly classified as active components, passive components, magnetic components, other electronic components, housing and printed circuit boards. Control ICs for active components and power semiconductors are mostly supplied from the USA and Japan, while passive components and magnetic materials, except for special cores for transformers,  can  be  made  at  home,  which  is  rather  highly  homemade  in  domestic  electronics industry. On the other hand, as the power management function becomes more and more important in the  future,  Micro  Controller  or  DSP  chip  will  become  an  indispensable  key  component  in  the application of high-end power supply.\n\n## Links between downstream application products and switching power supplies\n\nSwitching power supply produced in Taiwan is mainly applied in communication products, computers and peripheral equipment. With the rapid development of the computer and information industry, there is a number of domestic information products ranked first of output in the world, one of which is the switching power supply. Just because of this, the power supply is an indispensable component of downstream communication products and computer peripherals, network equipment, consumer electronics and industrial equipment, and thus bringing a lot of business opportunities for the power supply industry. As the demand for data centers expands and with the cloud computing effect, the demand for power supply applications in data centers is also growing rapidly. The emerging smart electricity and LED lighting industry also boost the market demand for smart meters and special power for smart lighting.\n\nIn Taiwan and East Asia, the upstream, midstream and downstream manufacturers cooperate closely, strengthening  the  overall  industrial  strength.  The  structure  of  the  upstream,  midstream  and downstream of the industry is shown as follows:",

Amongst them, motor vehicle MCU delivery is of the most urgent concern.    And delivery times for all automobile analogs and power supplies are longer than 40 weeks, while delivery periods of IGBT, MOSFET, and SiC components, which have been impacted by electric vehicles' rising demands of third-generation semiconductors,  also  maintain  at  above  42  weeks.    It  is  expected  that  the  normalization  of automotive semiconductor supply and demand has to wait until mid 2023.    However, following the rapid development of electric vehicle market, vehicle use semiconductors possess the highest growth momentum  amidst  all  terminal  applications.    According  to  Gartner's  prediction,  revenue  from automotive semiconductor market will continue to grow in the next five years; it was accounted for 9.0% of the overall revenue of the semiconductor industry in 2021, and the number is increasing over the years.  It is expected that revenue from automotive semiconductor market will reach US$98.7 billion in 2026, which is 12.6% market share of the whole semiconductor market.    In the next five years, each automotive semiconductor content amount will also be rapidly rising; it is expected that it will increase from US$665 in 2021 to US$1,026 in 2026.\n\n## 3. Trends of Products\n\nTaiwan's SPS product development can be divided into two aspects: 1) the technology development is towards the field of high efficiency, multiple input voltage, wider operating temperature, intelligence. The  equipment  traditionally  used  in  data  centers,  including  servers,  Networking  and  Telecom equipment for enterprises, and storage equipment, is also being applied to the communications room and  base  station  environment.  Modular  design  is  adopted  for  products,  parallel  stacking  mode (500W+500W+...) is applied, the application range of products is expanded (low-end, mid-end and high-end power), all of which has significantly shortened the product development cycle; 2) the product is developed as light, thin, short and small. The main market is the consumer end of cloud",

        "page_content": "computing, such as smart mobile phones, notebook computers, tablet computers, etc., and small power suppliers applied in 3C products. Looking forward to the future, the market demand for small, light, energy-saving and low-cost products will continue to increase. With the adoption of smart and portable communication products in large numbers, the appearance of the products becomes smaller and thinner, with the advantages of being portable. End-users have to connect with the cloud through the network and service providers who provide information with computing capacity, which directly stimulates the cloud service providers to build a large number of data centers. Under the convergence environment of 5G data and communication, both Telecom operators and network service providers must  actively  expand  network  equipment  to  meet  the  needs  of  users  and  AIoT  equipment  for information services, which will promote the growth of the market and form a virtuous cycle. Cloud data center server, Networking and Telecom equipment and consumer electronics products have become the most important application market for SPS.\n\nGlobal development of power suppliers for desktop personal computer use has already been highly mature.  The first three quarters in 2022 were benefited from improvement of material shortage during the pandemic and manufacturers' smooth order deliveries as backlogs due to port congestion were ameliorated, bringing prosperous growth that has not been seen for many years.  However, after the fourth quarter, the market rapidly entered recession due to backlogs at endpoint inventories, causing an unclear overall market outlook. The high level of standardization has forced desktop PC vendor manufacturers to expand their market share through price competition that drives down costs and mass production capacity. On the other hand, the market acceptance for beautiful and convenient All In One computer is increasing. Despite the recession, the market is still growing faster than traditional  desktop  PCs.  In  addition  to  basic  applications,  e-sports  PC  requires  stable  dynamic responses and high-power output as a result of adopting high-efficiency GPU for lots of computing, and there is still room for growth in power supplies for such special applications.\n\nThe  technology  of  power  supplies  for  personal  computers  extends  upward  to  servers,  large Networking,  Telecom  equipment  and  storage  devices.  With  the  rapid  development  of  cloud computing, mid-end and low-end servers tend to be matured after years of rapid growth in recent years. Although the technology, complexity and stability of the power supply applied in servers are higher  than  those  applied  in  PC  power  supply,  as  servers  move  towards  a  standardized  single architecture, the power supply also moves towards standardization due to the high commercialization of the mid-end and low-end systems. As a result, it is difficult for manufacturers to increase unit prices through differentiation. Therefore, in order to reduce the overall development cost, it tends to adopt the standardized design for power supply and reduce the number of parts and automatic production to improve the reliability.\n\nIn response to the large number of servers deployed in a single location by the data center, the product tends  to  gradually  shift  from  continuous  efficiency  improvement  of  a  single  power  supply  to systematic optimization of smart power management and cabinet power architecture, enhance the power factor of power supply and reduce total harmonic distortion through the introduction of digital control. In recent years, with production and R&D bases of servers, large Networking and Telecom equipment and storage equipment moving to China and Taiwan, Taiwan power supply manufacturer actively  developing  their  design  capabilities  with  relatively  lower  price  pressure  compared  to European, American and Japanese manufacturers, power supplies for mid-end and low-end servers, large Networking and Telecom equipments and storage equipments have been mainly designed and manufactured by Taiwan manufacturers. The server power supply market is becoming mature due to the advances in virtualization and cloud computing technology and the rise of distributed power architecture. The market for dedicated storage devices has also been hit by Intel-Based storage servers and cloud storage solutions. Under the decline of terminal application, the growth momentum of the market has shifted to Networking and Telecom equipment as the focus. Base on the AIOT's edge computing requirements and as it is expected to adopt a large number of IT servers and Networking and Telecom equipment for 5G infrastructure, the IT system and power supply in line with the environmental  standards  of  telecommunications  equipment  and  computer  room  will  drive  the development of a new generation of products in the future.\n\nPower  supply  for  communication  mostly  adopts  Distributed  Power  Architecture,  which  usually consists of an AC-DC Rectifier supplying the busbar voltage and a DC/DC Converter at the later stage. Such kinds of products are of high technology and with great importance attaching to product reliability. On the whole structure, it can reduce costs and improve efficiency by reducing the times of",

        "page_content": "power  conversion.  The  rectifier  sector  also  develops  toward  high  efficiency,  high  density.  In consideration of costs of DC-DC converter at the later stage, traditional high-end isolated converters tend to be replaced by non-isolated converters (POLs) with lower cost. For bus bar voltage, with the rise of new energy sources and the application of data centers, more efficient HVDC systems sprung up in the market. The emergence of different architectures and applications is expected to create new growth momentum in the highly standardized telecommunications power supply market.\n\nGiven the rising awareness about environmental protection, the opposition of nuclear and the call for phasing out nuclear, the pursuit of zero carbon, the reduction use of fossils fuels and the increase of green energy contribute to the growing importance of electricity grid stability and the efficient use of energy.      Smart  meters  may  enable  power  companies  to  keep  track  of  trends  in  electricity consumption in a timely manner and dispatch limited power resources more efficiently. Replacing the traditional meters in every household with smart meters with communication function is the most basic and important step, which is also a necessary step.\n\nEnergy management services can inject new energy into all energy products. In addition to smart meters, if all kinds of grid-connected power generation devices, energy storage systems, renewable energy power plants or related products can be introduced through energy management system (EMS) and demand control technology, the sales value of products in the power supply market can be doubled.\n\nWith  the  popularity  of  cloud  computing  and  big  data  applications,  data  centers  are  becoming large-scale, which also leads to a significant increase in the purchase of relevant power systems. OCP (Open Compute Project, initiated by Facebook, etc.), ODCC (Open Data Center Committee, initiated by BAT), Open19 (Open Data Center, initiated by LinkedIn) and other open computing organizations are playing a major role in driving innovation in the data center field, all of which have come up with a reference specification for modular cabinet design. In consideration of standardized cabinet design is a trend in the design of power converters applied for data centers, the design of modular converter module and expandable cabinet is proposed, which will enable the related products to meet the functional requirements of major data center manufacturers.\n\nAbout the EV industry, the supply chain has undergone tremendous changes after Tesla launched platform-based and modular production. Take the electric vehicle electronic control field covered by the company as an example, it has gradually moved from individual components (such as on-board chargers, motor controllers, DC converters) to an integrated design (all-in-one electronic control products). The integrated design enables the design of the mechanism and the appearance to be shared to achieve a miniaturized design and increase the power density. To improve the mileage and charging speed of electric vehicles, battery modules and electronic control systems continue to evolve towards 800V high voltage. The 800V high voltage platform launched by Porsche is marking the start of high voltage era. For the batteries in electric vehicles, mainstream electric vehicles manufacturers around the world use high energy density lithium batteries as an important driving force for expanding the territory of electric vehicles. However, even though the prospects of lithium batteries are promising, the market still hopes to develop new batteries that have higher energy density and higher safety that lithium batteries because numerous charge and discharge can easily affect the lifespan of lithium batteries and there are concerns for inflammation. Among them, the development of solid-state batteries and fuel cells has received the most attention. The development of electronic vehicle motors is also moving towards integration. Motor, transmissions and motor controllers are integrated and combined with artificial intelligence and big data for control.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the main customers of in-vehicle products of electric vehicles are from America  and  Japan,  and  their  models  are  primarily  sold  in  American  and  Asia.  The  principal competitor in Taiwan is Delta Electronics. Facing the huge business opportunities in the electric vehicle market, we are in a very favorable position. With the launch of all-in-one integrated products, the application of next-generation compound semiconductors and the continuous accumulation of R&D technologies, the automotive products are expected to have a long-term growth. However, attention should be paid to the shortage of components and long delivery time of semiconductors.\n\n## 4. Competition\n\nTaiwan is a major producer of information products in the world. Driven by downstream industries, Taiwan ranks first in global shipments of power supplies. In recent years, due to the impact of the PC industry being hit by the rise of low-cost computers, tablets and smartphones, the competition from",

        "page_content": "Chinese manufacturers at low prices, and the global economic downturn for several years, the prices of power supply products have been declining year by year, and the manufacturers' gross margins are not good as they used to be. However, with the increasing demand for energy-saving and carbon reduction in various countries, the conversion efficiency of power supply and power management function has become the focus of customer requirements. In recent years, the concept of smart electricity consumption has attracted more attention from all countries. Energy saving and effective use of energy has become one of the key requirements of competing products from all countries. Smart meters are the first step to implement smart power grids. How to effectively capture the data that users need from meters has become an important issue. In addition, the application of data captured by meters is also of great importance, and many enterprises have begun to invest resources in research and development in this market. Under the development of industry standards and the successive  formulation  of  product  specifications,  various  major  manufacturers  have  launched  a complete series of products. The thresholds for R&D design, manufacturing capability and cost control have also been raised.\n\nFurthermore, large cloud service companies and data center operators, and new types of applications such  as  edge  computing  systems  for  5G  infrastructure,  define  hardware  through  software  and introduce the concept of open hardware standards, which will not only continue to change the traditional  data  center  equipment,  but  will  also  impact  the  supply  pattern  and  demand  of telecommunications equipment. They, together with Telecom providers and data centers, purchased a huge amount of servers, Networking and Telecom equipment and storage, and went beyond the traditional brand vendors and directly to Asia to seek customized products from ODM manufacturers according to specific requirements, which caused a certain impact on the supply chain of traditional commercial information equipment. As a key component of the power supply industry, it is necessary to readjust the product strategy and design production mode in the new supply chain pattern, and seize the opportunity to seek a new position.\n\nBesides, due to China's manpower shortage and the risk of the US-China trade war, in order to maintain  lower  manufacturing  costs  and  improve  price  competitiveness,  and  quickly  launch energy-saving products that meet the market demand, and reduce the risk of single manufacturing site,  domestic  SPS  manufacturers  have  also  set  up  factories  in  Thailand,  Malaysia,  India,  the Philippines and other places, shortened the development  cycle  through  internal design standardization, and improved the automation productivity of mid-end and low-end products. In the past few years, the global power supply industry has been moving towards integration through consolidation  and  the  elimination  of  a  number  of  small  factories  in  the  face  of  fierce  market competition. However, there is still no single player to dominate the market, with the big Taiwanese players competing against each other. The conditions of each competitor are different, so the medium and above-sized companies in the market still have their own room for growth and development due to the difference in product positioning, and the advantages in manufacturing and R&D capabilities.\n\n## (III) Overview of Technologies and R&D Work\n\n- 1.

However, with the initiation of Russia-Ukraine War in early 2022 and the emergence of inflation issues, political and economic environments in countries around the world and various industries have all been impacted; and the global economy has therefore been veiled with uncertain growth factors. According to the latest report from market investigation and survey institution IDC, deliveries in personal computer market declined for the whole year in 2022, which was a decrease of 16.5% as compared with 2021. If judging from the delivery amounts in fourth quarter of 2022, it was a drastic decline of 28.1% as compared with personal computer delivery amounts in fourth quarter of 2021. The rest top 5 OEM were all exhibiting 5%-25% with varying degrees of declines.  Even though most of the users have already purchased newer versions of PC, their demands for newer PC versions are not very high, which has caused delivery amounts to show significant drops along with the impact of worsening global economy; but the numbers are still higher than the standards prior to the pandemic. Referencing to investigation and survey institutions Canalys and IDC, global PC market will continue to readjust this year until yearend, and it will have to wait until next year before recovery can be observed. Moreover, industrial electronic products, namely servers, storage devices, and networking and telecommunication products, are expected to pose continuously rising demands in light of cloud applications and 5G development needs.\n\nIn recent years, with the rising awareness of environmental protection and the continuous promotion of energy conservation and carbon reduction by the government, smart grids, fuel cells, electric vehicle onboard electronics, peripheral charging related facilities and medical care equipment, etc. are the long-term growth drivers of the power supply industry. In particular, AcBel has been deeply engaged in smart meters for a long time. In the future, there will be about one million standard biddings  released  in  Taiwan.  In  addition,  demand  for  alternative  energy,  supported  by  public expectations for cleaner energy and government policies, has soared, creating a new market. AcBel has a clear plan to build a solar power station, and hopes to gradually reach an economic scale and create synergy together with the power industry.\n\nThe Company has profound power R&D technology, and has the inherent advantage of diversified product lines, which, coupled with the variety of electronic products in the market, the rise of public awareness of environmental protection, the external factors of the government for energy policy",

two years:\n- 1. Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment, and property, plant, and equipment turnover ratio (times) It is mainly due to the increase in non-current liabilities over the same period.\n- 2. Current ratio, Quick ratio:\n- It is mainly due to the decrease in current liabilities over the same period.\n- 3. Interest coverage ratio\n- It is mainly due to the increase in interest expense over the same period.\n- 4. Pre-Tax Profit to Paid-in Capital Ratio (%):\n- It is mainly due to the increase in operating profit over the same period.\n- 5. Cash flow ratio (%), cash flow adequacy ratio (%), cash reinvestment ratio (%)\n\nIt is mainly due to the increase in net cash inflow from operating activities over the same period.\n\n- Note 1:  All financial data from 2018 to 2022 have been audited and attested by the CPAs.\n- Note 2:  The cash flow ratio is zero or negative.\n- Note 3:  The calculation formulas for the above items of financial analysis data are listed as follows:\n- 1. Financial structure\n- (1) Debt-to-assets ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets.\n- (2) Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities) / Net property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2. Solvency\n\n- (1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities.\n- (3) Interest coverage ratio = Income before tax and interest expenses / Interest expenses.\n\n## 3. Operating Ability\n\n- (1) Receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Net sales / Balance of average receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations).\n- (2) Average collection days = 365 / Receivables turnover ratio.\n- (3) Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory.\n- (4) Payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Balance of average payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations).\n- (5) Average days for sale = 365 / Inventory turnover ratio.",

Profitability\n\n- (1) Return on assets = [Net income after tax + Interest expenses x (1 - Tax rate)] / Average total assets.\n- (2) Return on equity = Net income after tax / Average total equity.\n- (3) Net profit margin = Net income after tax / Net sales.\n- (4) Earnings per share = (Net income attributable to owners of parent company - Dividends on preferred shares) / Weighted average number of shares issued (Note 4).\n\n## 5. Cash Flow\n\n- (1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Net cash flow adequacy ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities for the most recent five years / (Capital expenditures + Inventory increase + Cash dividends) for the most recent five years.\n- (3) Cash reinvestment ratio = (Net cash flow from operating activities - Cash dividends) / (Gross property, plant and equipment + Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Working capital). (Note 5)\n\n## 6. Leverage\n\n- (1) Operating  leverage  =  (Net  operating  income  -  Changes  in  operating  costs  and  expenses)/Operating income (Note 6).\n- (2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income - Interest expenses).\n- Note 4:  Special attention shall be paid to the following matters when the above calculation formula for earnings per share is used:\n- 1. Use the weighted average number of ordinary shares, not the number of shares issued at the end of the year.\n- 2. Capital increase for cash or treasury stock transactions shall be considered when the weighted average number of shares is calculated.\n- 3. Capital increase from surplus earnings or capital reserve shall be retrospectively adjusted by the proportion of capital increase when earnings per share for previous annual and semi-annual periods are calculated. The issue period for capital increase does not have to be considered.\n- 4. For preferred shares that are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, dividends (regardless of whether they are distributed) shall be deducted from net income after tax or included as net loss after tax. If preferred shares are non-cumulative, where net income after tax is available, dividends on preferred shares shall be deducted from net income after tax.

recent two years:\n\n- 1. Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment, and property, plant, and equipment turnover ratio (times) It is mainly due to the increase in non-current liabilities over the same period.\n- 2. Current ratio, quick ratio\n- It is mainly due to the decrease in current liabilities over the same period.\n- 3. Interest coverage ratio\n- It is mainly due to the increase in interest expense over the same period.\n- 4. Cash flow ratio (%), cash flow adequacy ratio (%), cash reinvestment ratio (%)\n- It is mainly due to the increase in net cash inflow from operating activities over the same period.\n- 5. Operating leverage:\n- It is mainly due to the increase in net operating profit over the same period.\n- Note 1: All financial data from 2018 to 2022 have been audited and attested by the CPAs.\n- Note 2: The ratio of cash flow and leverage is zero or negative.\n\nNote 3:\n\n- The calculation formulas for the above items of financial analysis data are listed as follows:\n\n## 1. Financial structure\n\n- (1) Debt-to-assets ratio = Total liabilities / Total assets.\n- (2) Ratio of long-term capital to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities) / Net property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 2. Solvency\n\n- (1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities.\n- (3) Interest coverage ratio = Income before tax and interest expenses / Interest expenses.\n\n## 3. Operating Ability\n\n- (1) Receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Net sales / Balance of average receivables (including accounts receivable and notes receivable due to business operations).\n- (2) Average collection days = 365 / Receivables turnover ratio.\n- (3) Inventory turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Average inventory.\n- (4) Payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations) turnover ratio = Cost of goods sold / Balance of average payables (including accounts payable and notes payable due to business operations).\n- (5) Average days for sale = 365 / Inventory turnover ratio.\n- (6) Property, plant and equipment turnover ratio = Net sales / Average net property, plant and equipment.\n- (7) Total asset turnover ratio = Net sales / Average total assets.\n\n## 4. Profitability\n\n- (1) Return on assets = [Net income after tax + Interest expenses x (1 - Tax rate)] / Average total assets.\n- (2) Return on equity = Net income after tax / Average total equity.",

Cash Flow\n- (1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities / Current liabilities.\n- (2) Net cash flow adequacy ratio = Net cash flow from operating activities for the most recent five years / (Capital expenditures + Inventory increase + Cash dividends) for the most recent five years.\n- (3) Cash reinvestment ratio = (Net cash flow from operating activities - Cash dividends) / (Gross property, plant and equipment + Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Working capital). (Note 5)\n\n## 6. Leverage\n\n- (1) Operating leverage = (Net operating income - Changes in operating costs and expenses)/Operating income (Note 6).\n- (2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income - Interest expenses).\n- Note 4:  Special attention shall be paid to the following matters when the above calculation formula for earnings per share is used:\n- 1. Use the weighted average number of ordinary shares, not the number of shares issued at the end of the year.\n- 2. Capital increase for cash or treasury stock transactions shall be considered when the weighted average number of shares is calculated.\n- 3. Capital increase from surplus earnings or capital reserve shall be retrospectively adjusted by the proportion of capital increase when earnings per share for previous annual and semi-annual periods are calculated. The issue period for capital increase does not have to be considered.\n- 4. For preferred shares that are non-convertible accumulated preferred shares, dividends (regardless of whether they are distributed) shall be deducted from net income after tax or included as net loss after tax. If preferred shares are non-cumulative, where net income after tax is available, dividends on preferred shares shall be deducted from net income after tax. No adjustment is required if the Company has loss after tax.\n\nNote 5:  Special attention shall be paid to the following in the process of cash flow analysis:\n\n- 1. Net cash flow from operating activities refers to net cash flow generated from operating activities in the statement of cash flows.\n- 2. Capital expenditures refer to the annual cash flow used in capital investment.\n- 3. The increase in inventory is included only if the balance at the end of the year is greater than the balance at the beginning of the year. If it is the other way around, the number used should be zero.\n- 4. Cash dividends include cash dividends on ordinary shares and preferred shares.\n- 5. Gross  property,  plant  and  equipment  refers  to  the  total  value  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  minus accumulated depreciation.\n- Note 6:  The issuer shall classify the operating costs and operating expenses as fixed or variable based on their nature. If it involves estimation or subjective judgment, attention shall be paid to its rationality and consistency.\n- Note 7:  Where company shares have no par value or where the par value per share is not NT$10, any calculation involving paid-in capital and its ratio shall be replaced with the calculation of the ratio of equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the balance sheet.",

Changes in Interest Rates\n\nCOVID-19 continued to plague the world in 2022, caused several millions of deaths thus far and devastated the global economy. As the inflation concern aggravates, U.S. and Europe successively took on tightening interest policies.    Central Bank of Taiwan has also raised interest rates to tackle inflation.  However,  as  the  Company  and  its  subsidiaries  currently  still  have  a  large  amount  of available bank credits, and the interest rates continue to be adjusted upward with minor changes, the impact on the Company's capital utilization should be limited.\n\n## 3. Changes in Exchange Rate\n\nThe exchange rate of Taiwan dollar against the US dollar at the end of 2022 was30.708 dollars, an depreciation of 3.018 dollars (-10.90%) compared with that at the end of 2021, which was favorable to most of the products quoted in US dollars by the Company and its subsidiaries. In order to effectively manage the exchange rate risk, the Company and its subsidiaries try their best to quote in US dollars for purchase and payment, so as to achieve the effect of natural hedging. The Company also has formulated the Operational procedures for Acquisition and Disposal of Assets, with the financial department referring to the analysis of well-known banks and research institutions at home and abroad, to engage in forwarding exchange, exchange rate swaps and other hedging derivative financial commodity trading, so as to reduce the risk of exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n## 4. Inflation\n\nThe consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) in Taiwan increased by 2.95% and 10.51%, respectively, in 2022 from 2021. The Company and its subsidiaries raised selling prices accordingly and hence the profits and losses were not materially affected.",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Account of Republic of China, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirement. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis of our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The key audit matters we judged shall be presented in the auditors' report were as follows:\n\n## 1. Operating Revenue- Revenue Recognition of Vender Management Inventory (VMI)\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(o) revenue for operating revenue recognition (including VMI). Information regarding sales revenue and revenue from contracts with customers is shown in note (6)(w) of the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nThe Group has established vender managed inventories in overseas warehouses which do not belong to the Group. The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Group, should be based on the circumstance of VMI client delivery. Both parties reconcile periodically to ensure the consistency in the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedures included: understanding and testing the related controls surrounding the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between AcBel Polytech Inc. and VMI  client  delivery,  selectively  conducting  external  confirmations  on  VMI,  as  well  as  assessing  the operating  revenue  recognition  (including  VMI)  of  the  Group  to  determine  whether  related  accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(h) inventories and note (5) of the consolidated financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses is shown in note (6)(g) of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Group is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluation in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Group and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## Other Matter\n\nAcBel Polytech Inc. has prepared its parent company only financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, on which we have issued an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and with the IFRSs, IASs, IFRC, SIC, endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republic  of  China,  and  for  such  internal  control  as  management  determines  is  necessary  to  enable  the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Group' s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cause significant doubt on the Group' s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain  sufficient  and  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (c) Basis of consolidation\n\n## (i) Principle of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its control over the entity.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases. Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The Group attributes the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the noncontrolling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nThe Group prepares consolidated financial statements using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n\nChanges in the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Any differences between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received will be recognized directly in equity, and the Group will attribute it to the owners of the parent.\n\nWhen the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related non-controlling interests and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost, with the resulting gain or loss being recognized in profit or loss. The Group recognizes as gain or loss in profit or loss the difference between (i) the fair value of the consideration received as well as any investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost; and (ii) the assets (including any goodwill), liabilities of the subsidiary as well as any related non-controlling interests at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost, as gain or loss in profit or loss. When the Group loses control of its subsidiary, it accounts for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if it had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.",

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes are reclassified as cash equivalents.\n\n## (g) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is an account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue. An account receivable without a significant financing component is initially measured at the transaction price.\n\n## (i) Financial assets\n\nAll regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date basis.\n\nOn initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) - debt investment; FVOCI - equity investment; or FVTPL. Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, in which case all affected financial assets are reclassified on the first day of the first reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## 1) Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nA  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\n- \u00b7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost, which is the amount at which the  financial  asset  is  measured  at  initial  recognition,  plus/minus,  the  cumulative amortization using the effective interest method, adjusted for any loss allowance.

However,  they  are  included  in  the  account receivables line items.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment's fair value in other comprehensive income. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognized in profit or loss. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in profit or loss unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Group's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the exdividend date.\n\n## 3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets.

This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Group's historical  experience  and  informed  credit  assessment  as  well  as  forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the globally understood definition of 'investment grade which is considered to be BBB- or higher per  Standard & Poor's, Baa3 or higher per Moody's or twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings'.\n\nThe Group assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has increased significantly if it is more than 30 days past due.\n\nThe Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the financial asset is more than 90 days past due or the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group in full.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from default events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter period if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities at  FVOCI  are  credit-impaired.  A  financial asset is ' creditimpaired'  when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. For corporate customers, the Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.

Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative or it  is  designated  as  such  on  initial  recognition.  Financial  liabilities  at  FVTPL  are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Derecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Group  derecognizes  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual  obligations  are discharged or cancelled, or expire. The Group also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different,  in  which  case  a  new  financial  liability  based  on  the  modified  terms  is recognized at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 5) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of balance sheet when, and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate exposures.

For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument.

The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (h) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is based on weighted-average costing principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n## (i) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group' s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of those associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group from the date on which significant influence commences until the date on which significant influence ceases.

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\n## (i) As a lessee\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any  initial  direct  costs  incurred  and  an  estimate  of  costs  to  dismantle  and  remove  the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- 1) fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- 2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- 3) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n- 4) payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when:\n\n- 1) there is a change in future lease payments arising from the change in an index or rate; or\n- 2) there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n- 3) there is a change in the lease term resulting from a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, or\n- 4) there is a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option; or\n- 5) there are any lease modifications",

The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor sale-and-leaseback transactions, the Group applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of the asset. If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Group recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Group will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (ii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance  lease  or  an  operating  lease.  To  classify  each  lease,  the  Group  makes  an  overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Group considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\n## (l) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.",

All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Amortization\n\nAmortization is calculated over the cost of the asset, less its residual value, and is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of computer software for current and comparative periods are 2~5 years.\n\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\n## (m) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units (CGUs).\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss.

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.\n\nA provision for the site restoration is measured at a restoration cost which was estimated using different assumptions on the related changes in cost-elements from current market price.\n\nThe  Group follows the policy of Bureau of Energy, Ministry of Economic Affairs, accruing the module recycle fee based on the size of the power station, and recognize as provision by the present value of decommissioning costs.\n\n## (o) Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Group's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe  Group  manufactures  electronic  components  to  electronic  manufacturers.  The  Group recognizes revenue when control of the products has been transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe  Group  often  offers  volume  discounts  to  its  customers  based  on  aggregate  sales  of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term, which is consistent with the market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed through the grid, and the revenue is calculated according to the fee agreed with Taiwan Power Company.\n\n## (iii) Rendering of service\n\nThe Group provides project management advisory and maintenance services. Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services provided is determined based on the services incurred to date as a proportion of the total services of the transaction. In case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by the Group exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognized.\n\n## (iv) Financing components\n\nThe Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\n## (p) Government grants and government assistance\n\nThe Group recognizes an unconditional government grant as other income when the grant becomes receivable. Other government grants related to assets are initially recognized as deferred income at fair value if there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant; they are then recognized in profit or loss as other income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses or losses incurred are recognized in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the periods in which the expenses or losses are recognized.\n\n## (q) Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Except for expenses related to business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes shall be recognized in profit or loss.",

The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred taxes arise due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits (losses) at the time of the transaction;\n- (ii) temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n- (iii) taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred taxes are measured at tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reserve, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the following criteria are met:\n\n- (i) the Group has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and\n- (ii) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:\n- 1) the same taxable entity; or\n- 2) different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to realize the assets and liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for the carry forward of unused tax losses, unused tax credits, and deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilized. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (r) Business combination\n\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method. The goodwill arising from an acquisition is measured as the excess of (i) the consideration transferred (which is generally measured at fair value) and (ii) the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, both over the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. If the amount calculated above is a deficit balance, the Company recognized that amount as a gain on a bargain purchase in profit or loss immediately after reassessing whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed.\n\nAll acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except for the issuance of debt or equity instruments.\n\nFor each business combination, the Group measures any non-controlling interests in the acquiree either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest' s  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree' s identifiable net assets, if the non-controlling interests are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquire' s net assets in the event of liquidation. Other components of non controlling interests are measured at their acquisition-date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by the IFRSs endorsed by the FSC.\n\nIn a business combination achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held equity interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value, and recognizes the resulting gain or loss, if any, in profit or loss. In prior reporting periods, the Group may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognized in other comprehensive income will be recognized on the same basis as would be required if the Group had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest. If the disposal of the equity interest required a reclassification to profit or loss, such an amount will be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete are reported in the Group' s financial statements. During the measurement period, the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively adjusted, or additional assets or liabilities are recognized to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nAll acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except for the issuance of debt or equity instruments.\n\n## (s) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Group' s net obligation in respect of the defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.\n\nThe calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.  When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the total of the present value of the economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present  value  of  the  economic  benefits,  consideration  is  given  to  any  minimum  funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity. The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n## (iii) Other long-term employee benefits\n\nThe Group provides the loans with favorable terms to employees and presented in other noncurrent assets.\n\n## (iv) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (t) Share-based payment\n\nThe grant-date fair value of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements granted to employees is generally recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.",

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding  after  adjustment  for  the  effects  of  all  dilutive  potential  ordinary  shares.  Dilutive potential  ordinary  shares  comprise  employee  stock  options,  remuneration  to  employees  not  yet approved by the directors, restricted employee shares, and convertible bonds.\n\n## (v) Operating segments\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may incur revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the Group). Operating results of the operating segment are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. Each operating segment consists of standalone financial information.\n\n## (5) Significant accounting assumptions and judgments, and major sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe  management  continues  to  monitor  the  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions.  The  management recognizes any changes in accounting estimates during the period and the impact of those changes in accounting estimates in the next period.\n\nThere are no critical judgments in applying the accounting policies that have significant effects on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year is as follows.  Those  assumptions  and  estimation  have  been  updated  to  reflect  the  impact  of  COVID-19 pandemic:\n\n## Inventory valuation\n\nInventories are supposed to be measured based on the lower of cost or net realizable value. Due to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, which tends to devalue the inventories, the Group evaluates the costs of inventories using the net realizable value. Inventory valuation is based on the demand of the products during the specific period, therefore, the value of inventories may be variable due to the nature of fast-paced industry.

The  estimated  amounts  mentioned  above  are calculated based on the net profit before tax, excluding the remuneration to employees and directors of each period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration of employees and directors as specified in the Company's Articles. These remunerations were expensed under operating costs or operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one day before the date of the Board of Directors meeting.",

However, the clients generally are not required to provide collaterals.\n\n## 3) Receivables and debt securities\n\nFor credit risk exposure of notes and accounts receivable, please refer to note (6)(f).\n\nOther  financial  assets  at  amortized  cost,  including  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  time deposit, and current and non-current other receivables, are considered to have low credit risk, and thus, the impairment provision recognized during the period was limited to 12 months expected credit losses.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 2) Valuation technique for financial instruments not measured at fair value\n\nThe Group's valuation techniques and assumptions used for financial assets at amortized cost not measured at fair value are as follows:\n\nIf there is quoted price generated by transactions, the recent transaction price and quoted price data is used as the basis for fair value measurement. However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n\n## 3) Valuation technique for financial instruments measured at fair value\n\n## a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices. The quoted price of a financial instrument obtained from main exchanges and onthe-run bonds from Taipei Exchange can be used as a basis to determine the fair value of the listed companies' equity instrument and debt instrument of the quoted price in an active market.\n\nMeasurements of fair value of financial instruments without an active market are based on valuation technique.\n\n## b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nMeasurement of fair value of derivative instruments is based on the valuation techniques that are generally accepted by the market participants. For instance, discount method, option pricing models, or Binominal pricing model. Fair value of forward currency exchange is usually determined by using the forward currency rate.\n\n## 4) Transfers between Level 1 and Level 3\n\nThe Group holds an investment in equity shares of Gogoro, which is classified as fair value  through  other  comprehensive  income.  The  fair  value  of  the  investment  was previously categorized as Level 3 as of September 30 and December 31, 2021, because the shares had no quoted market prices and the Company used significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value. In April 2022, Gogoro listed its equity shares on an exchange and they were traded in active market, therefore, the fair value measurement was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThere was no transfer among fair value hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2022.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (aa) Financial risk management\n\n- (i) Overview\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its financial instruments \uff1a\n\n- 1) Credit risk\n- 2) Liquidity risk\n- 3) Market risk\n\nThe following likewise discusses the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the above mentioned risks. For more disclosures about the quantitative effects of these risks exposures, please refer to the respective notes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe Group's finance department provide business services for the overall internal department. It sets the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk arising from both the domestic and international financial market operations. The Group minimizes the risk exposure through derivative financial instruments. The Board of Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative  financial  instruments  in accordance with the Group' s policy about risks arising from financial instruments such as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the investments of excess liquidity. The audit committee and internal auditors of the Group continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the Group' s policy and the risk management policies and procedures.  The Group has no transactions  in  financial  instruments  (including  derivative  financial  instruments)  for  the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the Board of Directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group' s receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Group's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Group's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed periodically. Customers that fail to meet the Group's benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Group's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk.  The Group's customers are mainly from the high-tech industry. In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Group constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Group regularly accesses the collectability of accounts receivable and recognizes allowance for accounts receivable. The impairment losses are always within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records and the degree of cooperation. Customers that are graded as ' high risk'  are placed on a restricted customer list and monitored by the finance department more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.\n\nThe Group set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and other receivables. The allowance for bad debt account consists of specific losses relating to individually significant exposure and the unrecognized losses arising from similar  assets  groups.  The  allowance  for  bad  debt  account  is  based  on  historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investments\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Group's finance department. Since the Group's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties are banks, financial institutes and corporate organizations with good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.  The finance department evaluates the counterparty's credit condition when investing in bond investment without an active market, and do not expect to have any significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nPlease refer to note (13)(a) for the financial guarantees as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Group' s management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank and issued corporate bonds form an important source of liquidity for the Group. Please refer to note (6)(l) and note (6)(o) for unused short-term and long-term credit lines as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (v) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Group's income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe Group buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market  risks.  Generally  the  Group  seeks  to  apply  hedge  accounting  in  order  to  manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in NTD, USD, and CNY.\n\nAt any point in time, the Group hedges specific percentage of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Group also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe Group designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts are excluded from designation as the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Group's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash  flows.  The  Group  assesses  whether  the  derivative  designated  in  each  hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group borrows funds on fixed and variable interest rates, which has a risk exposure to changes in fair value and cash flow. Therefore, the Group manages the interest rates risk by maintaining an adequate combination of fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## 3) Other price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to equity price risk arising from investments in foreign listed equity securities.",

The revenue recognition, according to the partial sales contract of the Company, should be based  on  the  circumstance  of  VMI  client  delivery.  Both  parties  reconcile  periodically  to  ensure  the consistency in the amount and timing of sales recognition. Therefore, revenue recognition, VMI is one of the key judgmental areas for our audit.\n\n## Audit Procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedures included: understanding and testing the related controls surrounding the aforementioned sales and collection cycle, reconciling the account records between AcBel Polytech Inc. and VMI client delivery, selectively conducting external confirmations on VMI and assessing the operating revenue recognition (including VMI) of the Company to determine whether related accounting policies are applied appropriately.\n\n## 2. Inventory valuation\n\nPlease refer to note (4)(g) inventories and note (5) of the financial statements for inventories and accounting estimate of inventory valuation, respectively. Information regarding the inventory and related expenses is shown in note (6)(f) of the financial statements.\n\n## Description of key audit matter:\n\nDue to the impact of product life cycle and industrial competition in electronics industry, the price variability for the inventory of the Company is expected. Therefore, the test of inventory valuation is one of the significant evaluations in audit procedures.\n\n## Audit procedure:\n\nOur principal audit procedure included: understanding and testing related controls of production cycle and assessing the allowance for loss due to price decline, obsolete, and slow-moving inventories to determine whether policies of the Company and accounting policies are applied. In addition, in order to verify the rationality of assessment on allowance to reduce the price of inventory to the market price, we inspected the inventory aging statement, analyzed the change in aging inventory, as well as verified the aging inventory statement and the calculation of lower of cost or net realizable value\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the Company' s ability to continue as a going concern disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the management either intends to liquidate the Company  or  to  cease operations or has no realistic alternative but to do so.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing of the Republic of China, we exercise professional judgment and professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- 1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- 2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- 3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- 4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- 5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- 6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the investment in other entities accounted for using the equity method to express an opinion on this financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.",

Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issuing equity instruments do not affect its classification.\n\n## (e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Time deposits which meet the above definition and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments rather than for investment or other purposes should be recognized as cash equivalents.\n\n## (f) Financial instruments\n\nAccount receivables and debt securities issued are initially recognized when they are originated. All other financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. A financial asset (unless it is an account receivable without a significant financing component) or financial liability is initially measured at fair value plus, for an item not at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.

Interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as impairment, are recognized in profit or loss.

However, they are included in the trade receivables' line item.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment' s fair value in other  comprehensive  income.  This  election  is  made  on  an  instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nDebt investments at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value.

Other net gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and are never reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nDividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the date on which the Company's right to receive payment is established, which in the case of quoted securities is normally the ex-dividend date.\n\n## 3) Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)\n\nAll financial assets not classified as amortized cost or FVOCI described as above are measured at FVTPL, including derivative financial assets. On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate a financial asset, which meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 4) Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortized cost (including cash and cash equivalents, amortized costs, notes and accounts receivable, other receivables (current and non-current), guarantee deposit paid and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe Company measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (ECL), except for the following which are measured as 12-month ECL:\n\n- \u00b7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n- \u00b7 other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default occurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nLoss allowance for accounts receivable and contract assets are always measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECL, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Company' s historical experience and informed credit assessment as well as forwardlooking information.\n\nThe Company considers a debt security to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is  equivalent  to  the  globally  understood  definition  of  ' investment  grade  which  is considered to be BBB- or higher per  Standard & Poor's, Baa3 or higher per Moody's, twA or higher per Taiwan Ratings'.",

Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the  Company in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at the effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  assesses  whether  financial  assets  carried  at amortized cost and debt securities at FVOCI are credit-impaired. A financial asset is ' credit-impaired' when  one  or  more  events  that  have  a  detrimental  impact  on  the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:\n\n- \u00b7 significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract such as a default or being more than 90 days past due;\n- \u00b7 the  lender  of  the  borrower,  for  economic  or  contractual  reasons  relating  to  the borrower's financial difficulty, having granted to the borrower a concession that the lender would not otherwise consider;\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization; or\n- \u00b7 the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is charged to profit or loss and is recognized in other comprehensive income instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.",

The Company expects no significant recovery from the amount written off. However,  financial  assets  that  are  written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Company's procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n## 5) Derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe  Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash  flows  in  a  transaction  in  which  substantially  all  of  the  risks  and  rewards  of ownership  of  the  financial  asset  are  transferred  or  in  which  the  Company  neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.\n\nThe Company enters transactions whereby it transfers assets recognized in its statement of balance sheet but retains either all or substantially all the risks and rewards of the transferred assets. In these cases, the transferred assets are not derecognized.\n\n## (ii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n## 1) Classification of debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as financial liabilities or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## 2) Equity instrument\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all its liabilities. Equity instruments issued are recognized as the amount of consideration received, less the direct cost of issuing.\n\n## 3) Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as at FVTPL if it is classified as held-for-trading, it is a derivative, or it is designated as such on initial recognition. Financial liabilities at FVTPL are measured at fair value and net gains and losses, including any interest expense, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOther financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.

The Company also derecognizes a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different, in which case a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognized at fair value.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability extinguished and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 5) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount presented in the statement of balance sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (iii) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Company holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as fair value hedges.\n\nAt  inception  of  designated  hedging  relationships,  the  Company  documents  the  risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The Company also documents the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, including whether the changes in cash flows of the hedged item and hedging instrument are expected to offset each other.\n\nThe fair value change on qualifying hedging instruments is recognized in profit or loss except when the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument designated at FVOCI in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe carrying amount of a hedged item not already measured at fair value is adjusted for the fair value change attributable to the hedged risk with a corresponding entry in profit or loss. For debt instruments measured at FVOCI, the carrying amount is not adjusted as it is already at fair value,  but  the  hedging  gain  or  loss  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  instead  of  other comprehensive income. When the hedged item is an equity instrument designated at FVOCI, the hedging gain or loss remains in other comprehensive income to match that of the hedging instrument. Where hedging gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss, they are recognized in the same line as the hedged item.",

The discontinuation is accounted for prospectively. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## (g) Inventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The cost of inventories is calculated using the weight-average method, and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their present location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.\n\nNet realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\n## (h) Investment in associates\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at cost. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment in associates includes goodwill arising from the acquisition, less, any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe financial statements include the Company's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of those associates after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Company  from  the  date  on  which  significant  influence  commences  until  the  date  on  which significant influence ceases.\n\nThe  Company recognizes any changes of its proportionate share in the investee within capital surplus,  when  an  associate' s  equity  changes  due  to  reasons  other  than  profit  and  loss  or comprehensive income, which did not result in changes in actual significant influence.\n\nGains and losses resulting from transactions between the Company and an associate are recognized only to the extent of unrelated Company's interests in the associate.\n\nWhen the Company's share of losses of an associate equals or exceeds its interests in an associate, it discontinues recognizing its share of further losses. After the recognized interest is reduced to zero, additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognized, only to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\n## (i) Investment in subsidiaries\n\nWhen preparing the parent-company-only financial statements, investment in subsidiaries which are controlled by the Company is accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, the net income, other comprehensive income and equity attributable to shareholders of the Company in the  parent-company-only  financial  statement,  are  equal  to  those  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## (i) As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be reliably determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- 1) fixed payments; including in-substance fixed payments;\n- 2) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- 3) amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and\n- 4) payments for purchase or termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nThe lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when:\n\n- 1) there is a change in future lease payments arising from the change in an index or rate; or\n- 2) there is a change in the Company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; or\n- 3) there is a change in the lease term resulting from a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, or\n- 4) there is a change of its assessment on whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option; or\n- 5) there are any lease modifications\n\nWhen  the  lease  liability  is  remeasured,  other  than  lease  modifications,  a  corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or in profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.",

The Company recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nFor sale-and-leaseback transactions, the Company applies the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in IFRS15 to determine whether the transfer of an asset is accounted for as a sale of the asset. If the transfer of an asset satisfies the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company measures the right-of-use asset arising from the leaseback at the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the right of use retained. Accordingly, the Company recognizes only the amount of any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. If the transfer of an asset does not satisfy the requirement of IFRS15 to be accounted for as a sale of the asset, the Company will continue to recognize the transferred asset and shall recognize the financial liability equal to the transfer proceeds.\n\n## (ii) As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company acts as a lessor, it determines at lease commencement whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. To classify each lease, the Company makes an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then the lease is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, the Company considers certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\n## (l) Intangible assets\n\n## (i) Recognition and measurement\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost, less accumulated impairment losses.\n\nExpenditure on research activities is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is capitalized only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Company intends to, and has sufficient resources to, complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, it is recognized in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to  initial  recognition,  development  expenditure  is  measured  at  cost,  less  accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.",

All other expenditure, including expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\n## (iii) Amortization\n\nAmortization is calculated over the cost of the asset, less its residual value, and is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives of computer software for current and comparative periods are 3~5 years.\n\nAmortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each annual reporting date and adjusted if appropriate.\n\n## (m) Impairment - non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (other than inventories and deferred tax assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.",

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The unwinding of the discount is recognized as finance cost.\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, based on historical  warranty  data  and  a  weighting  of  all  possible  outcomes  against  their  associated probabilities.\n\n## (o) Recognition of revenue\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a customer. The accounting policies for the Company's main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n## (i) Sale of goods\n\nThe Company manufactures and sells electronic components to electronic manufacturers. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the products has transferred, being when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the customer's acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Company has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Company often offers volume discounts to its customers based on aggregate sales of electronic components. Revenue from these sales is recognized based on the price specified in the  contract,  net  of  the  estimated  volume  discounts.  Accumulated  experience  is  used  to estimate the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A contract liability is recognized for expected volume discounts payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales of electronic  components  are  made  with  a  credit  term, which is consistent with the market practice.\n\n## (ii) Electricity generating income\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  electricity  is  recognized  after  the  electricity  transmission  is completed through the grid, and the revenue is calculated according to the fee agreed with Taiwan Power Company.",

Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting period in which the services are rendered. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services provided is determined based on the services incurred to date as a proportion of the total services of the transaction. In case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment schedule. If the services rendered by the Company exceed the payment, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the services rendered, a contract liability is recognized.\n\n## (iv) Financing components\n\nThe Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. Consequently, the Company does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\n## (p) Employee benefits\n\n## (i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations for contributions to defined contribution plans are expensed as the related service is provided.\n\n## (ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe Company's net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each the plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets.\n\nThe calculation of defined benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset for the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the  return  on  plan  assets  (excluding  interest)  and  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling  (if  any, excluding  interest),  are  recognized  immediately  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and accumulated in retained earnings within equity. The Company determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liability (asset) for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the then-net defined benefit liability (asset). Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in profit or loss.",

The Company recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.\n\n## (iii) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognized  for  the  amount  expected  to  be  paid  if  the  Company  has  a  present  legal  or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## (q) Share-based payment\n\nThe grant-date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognized as employee expenses, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards which related service  and  non-market  performance  conditions  are  expected  to  be  met,  such  that  the  amount ultimately recognized as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.\n\nFor share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant-date fair value of the sharebased  payment  is  measured  to  reflect  such  conditions, and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.\n\n## (r) Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Except for expenses related to business combinations  or  recognized  directly  in  equity  or  other  comprehensive  income,  all  current  and deferred taxes are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe Company has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatment, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore accounted for them under IAS37.\n\nCurrent taxes comprise the expected tax payables or receivables on the taxable profits (losses) for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. The amount of current tax payables or receivables are the best estimate of the tax amount expected to be paid or received that reflects uncertainty related to income taxes, if any. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\n\nDeferred taxes arise due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  their  respective  tax  bases.  Deferred  taxes  are recognized except for the following:\n\n- (i) temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profits (losses) at the time of the transaction;",

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefits will be realized; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.\n\n## (s) Business combination\n\nThe  Company  accounts  for  business  combinations using the acquisition method. The goodwill arising from an acquisition is measured as the excess of (i) the consideration transferred (which is generally measured at fair value) and (ii) the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, both over the identifiable net assets acquired at the acquisition date. If the amount calculated above is a deficit balance, the Company recognized that amount as a gain on a bargain purchase in profit or loss immediately after reassessing whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed.\n\nAll acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except for the issuance of debt or equity instruments.\n\nFor each business combination, the Group measures any non-controlling interests in the acquiree either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest' s  proportionate  share  of  the  acquiree' s identifiable net assets, if the non-controlling interests are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the acquire' s net assets in the event of liquidation. Other components of non controlling interests are measured at their acquisition-date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by the IFRSs endorsed by the FSC.",

In prior reporting periods, the Company may have recognized changes in the value of its equity interest in the acquiree in other comprehensive income. If so, the amount that was recognized in other comprehensive income will be recognized on the same basis as would be required if the Company had disposed directly of the previously held equity interest. If the disposal of the equity interest required a reclassification to profit or loss, such an amount will be reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete are reported in the Company's financial statements. During the measurement period, the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively adjusted, or additional assets or liabilities are recognized to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period will not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nAll acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except for the issuance of debt or equity instruments.\n\n## (t) Earnings per share\n\nThe  Company discloses the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary equity holders  of  the  Company.  The  calculation  of  basic  earnings  per  share  is  based  on  the  profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company divided by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after adjustment for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. Dilutive potential ordinary shares comprise employee stock options, remuneration to employees not yet approved by the directors, restricted employee shares and convertible bonds.\n\n## (u) Operating segments\n\nThe Company discloses the operating segments information in the consolidated financial statements. Therefore,  the  Company  does  not  disclose  the  operating  segments  information  in  the  parentcompany-only financial statements.\n\n## (5) Significant accounting assumptions and judgments, and major sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nIn preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ these estimates.\n\nThe  management  continues  to  monitor  the  accounting  estimates  and  assumptions.

The  above  decision  had  been approved by the Securities and Futures Bureau of FSC. Thereafter, the Company issued 9,670 thousand restricted stocks based on the resolution approved during the board meeting held on August 2, 2022.\n\nAccording  to  the  Company'   s  policy,  the  above  employee  stock  options  were  issued  without consideration, wherein 30%, 30% and 40% of the restricted shares were vested for employees who continued  to  provide  service  for  at  least  1  year,  2  years  and  3  years,  respectively,  from  the registration  date  as  well  as  the  effective  date,  and  consequently,  met  the  performance requirements.Thereafter, the restricted shares were kept by a trust, appointed by the Company, before they are vested. These restricted shares shall not be sold, pledged, transferred, gifted, or disposed by any other means, to third parties during the custody period. The voting rights of these shares are executed by the custodian, and the custodian shall act based on the law and regulations. If the shares remain unvested after the vesting period, the Company will redeem all the unvested shares without consideration and cancel the shares thereafter.\n\nThe Details of the restricted stock of the Company are as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2022      |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|\n| Outstanding shares on January 1   | -         |\n| Granted during the period         | 9,670,000 |\n| Outstanding shares on December 31 | 9,670,000 |\n\nThe fair value of the abovementioned employee stock options was NT$31.35, which was the closing price of the Company at grant date; and the capital surplus resulting from the employee stock options amounted to $206,454.

However, if the Company has accumulated deficits, the profit should be reserved to offset the deficit.\n\nThe aforementioned profit for the year is the earnings before tax, excluding directors' remuneration.\n\nThe remuneration to employees may be distributed in stocks or in cash and may be distributed to such targets including the employees of the Company' s subordinate companies who meet certain requirements.\n\nFor  the  years  ended  December  31,  2022  and  2021,  the  Company  estimated  its  employee remuneration  amounting  to  $55,123  and  $37,682,  respectively,  and  directors'  remuneration amounting  to  $7,875  and  $7,246,  respectively.  The  estimated  amounts  mentioned  above  were calculated based on the net profit before tax, excluding the remuneration to employees, directors of each period, multiplied by the percentage of remuneration to employees, directors as specified in the Company's  articles.  These  remunerations  were  expensed  under  operating  costs  or  operating expenses. If remuneration to employees is resolved to be distributed in stock, the number of shares is calculated based on the closing price of the Company's shares, one day before the date of the Board of Directors' meeting. There is no difference between the amount approved in the meeting of the Board of Directors and those recognized in the financial statements in 2022 and 2021.\n\nFor the years ended December 2021 and 2020, the remunerations to employees amounted to $37,682 and $60,929, and to directors amounted to $7,246 and $15,820, respectively. The aforemationed estimated amounts are identical to those of the actual distributions. The related information is available on the Market Observation Post System Website.",

A weakening (strengthening) 5% of each major foreign currency against Company entities'  functional currency as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 would have affected the net profit before tax as followings:\n\n|                       | 2022       | 2021      |\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------|\n| USD (against the TWD) |            |           |\n| Strengthening 5%      | $ (55,189) | (331,415) |\n| Weakening 5%          | 55,189     | 331,415   |\n\nSince the Company has many kinds of functional currency, the information on foreign exchange gain (loss) on monetary items is disclosed by total amount.

Regarding the liabilities with variable interest rates, the analysis is on the basis of the assumption that the amount of liabilities outstanding at the reporting date was outstanding throughout the year. The rate of change is expressed as the interest rate increases or decreases by 0.25% when reporting to management internally, which also represents management of the Company's assessment on the reasonably possible interval of interest rate change.\n\nIf  the  interest  rate  had  increased  or  decreased  by  0.25%,  the  net  profit  before  tax  was illustrated below for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which would be mainly resulted from the bank savings and short-term borrowings with variable interest rates.  Since the interest of short-term borrowings were fixed, changes in market interest of the aforementioned financial assets will have no effect on the net profit before tax.\n\n|                | 2022      | 2021    |\n|----------------|-----------|---------|\n| 0.25% increase | $ (2,900) | (2,790) |\n| 0.25% decrease | 2,900     | 2,790   |\n\n## (v) Fair value\n\n## 1) Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, financial instruments used for hedging, and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are measured on a recurring basis. The carrying amount and fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities, including the information on fair value  hierarchy  were  as  follows;  however,  except  as  described  in  the  following paragraphs, for financial instruments not measured at fair value whose carrying amount is  reasonably  close  to  the  fair  value,  and  lease  liabilities,  disclosure  of  fair  value information is not required:",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## 2) Valuation technique for financial instruments not measured at fair value\n\nThe Company's valuation techniques and assumptions used for financial instrument not measured at fair value are as follows:\n\nIf there is quoted price generated by transactions, the recent transaction price and quoted price data is used as the basis for fair value measurement. However, if no quoted prices are available, the discounted cash flows are used to estimate fair values.\n\n## 3) Valuation technique for financial instruments measured at fair value\n\n## a) Non-derivative financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments trade in active markets are based on quoted market prices. The quoted price of a financial instrument obtained from main exchanges and onthe-run bonds from Taipei Exchange can be used as a basis to determine the fair value of the listed companies' equity instrument and debt instrument of the quoted price in an active market.\n\nMeasurements of fair value of financial instruments without an active market are based on valuation technique.\n\n## b) Derivative financial instruments\n\nMeasurement of fair value of derivative instruments is based on the valuation techniques that are generally accepted by the market participants. For instance, discount method or option pricing models. Fair value of forward currency exchange is usually determined by using the forward currency rate.\n\n## 4) Transfers between Level 1 and Level 3\n\nThe Company holds an investment in equity shares of Gogoro, which is classified as fair value  through  other  comprehensive  income.  The  fair  value  of  the  investment  was previously categorized as Level 3 as of December 31, 2021, because the shares had no quoted market prices and the Company used significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value. In April 2022, Gogoro listed its equity shares on an exchange and they were traded in active market, therefore, the fair value measurement was transferred from Level 3 to Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.",

Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\n## (y) Financial risk management\n\n- (i) Overview\n\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its financial instruments \uff1a\n\n- 1) Credit risk\n- 2) Liquidity risk\n- 3) Market risk\n\nThe  following  likewise  discusses  the  Company' s  objectives,  policies  and  processes  for measuring  and  managing  the  above  mentioned  risks.  For  more  disclosures  about  the quantitative  effects  of  these  risks'  exposures,  please  refer  to  the  respective  notes  in  the accompanying financial statements.\n\n## (ii) Structure of risk management\n\nThe  Company' s  finance  department  provide  business  services  for  the  overall  internal department. It sets the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk and the methods used to measure the risk arising from both the domestic and international financial market operations.  The  Company  minimizes  the  risk  exposure  through  derivative  financial instruments.  The  Board  of  Directors  regulated  the  use  of  derivative  and  non-derivative financial  instruments  in  accordance  with  the  Company' s  policy  about  risks  arising  from financial instruments such as currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments and the investments of excess liquidity. The audit committee and internal auditors of the Company continue with the review of the amount of the risk exposure in accordance with the Company's policy and the risk management policies and procedures.  The Company has no transactions in financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) for the purpose of speculation.  The finance department reports to the board of directors and the audit committee periodically.\n\n## (iii) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities.\n\n## 1) Accounting receivable and other receivables\n\nThe Company's finance department has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analyzed individually for creditworthiness before the Company's credit limits are  offered.  Credit  limits  are  established  for  each  customer,  which  represent  the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the finance department, and are reviewed  periodically.  Customers  that  fail  to  meet  the  Company's  benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Company only on a prepayment basis.",

        "page_content": "## ACBEL POLYTECH INC.\n\n## Notes to the  Financial Statements\n\nThe  Company' s  exposure  to  credit  risk  is  influenced  mainly  by  the  individual characteristics of each customer. However, management also considers the demographics of the Company's customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, as these factors may have an influence on credit risk. The Company' s customers are mainly from the high-tech industry.  In order to mitigate account receivable credit risk, the Company constantly assesses the financial status of the customers, and requests the customers to provide guarantee or security if necessary. The Company  regularly  accesses  the  collectability  of  accounts  receivable  and  recognizes allowance  for  accounts  receivable.  The  impairment  losses  are  always  within management's expectation.\n\nIn  monitoring  customer  credit  risk,  customers  are  grouped  according  to  their  credit characteristics,  including  customer  profile,  operating  and  financial  status,  payment records and the degree of cooperation. Customers that are graded as ' high risk'  are placed on a restricted customer list and monitored by the finance department more strictly, and the transactions are made on a more cautious way.\n\nThe Company set the allowance for bad debt account to reflect the estimated losses for trade and other receivables. The allowance for bad debt account consists of specific losses relating to individually significant exposure and the unrecognized losses arising from similar assets groups. The allowance for bad debt account is based on historical collection record of similar financial assets.\n\n## 2) Investment\n\nThe  credit  risk  exposure  in  the  bank  deposits,  fixed  income  investments  and  other financial instruments are measured and monitored by the Company's finance department. Since the Company's transaction counterparties and contractually obligated counterparties  are  banks,  financial  institutes  and  corporate  organizations  with  good credits, there are no compliance issues, and therefore no significant credit risk.  The finance department evaluates the counterparty's credit condition when investing in bond investment without an active market, and does not expect to have any significant credit risk.\n\n## 3) Guarantees\n\nThe Company could only provide financial guarantees to subsidiaries under its policy. Please refer to note (13)(a) for the financial guarantees provided to subsidiaries by the Company as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## (iv) Liquidity risk\n\nThe Company manages sufficient cash and cash equivalents so as to cope with its operations and mitigate the effects of fluctuations in cash flows. The Company's management supervises the banking facilities and ensures in compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.\n\nThe loans and borrowings from the bank and issued corporate bonds form an important source of liquidity for the Company.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe  Company buys and sells derivatives, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks. Generally, the Company seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.\n\n## 1) Currency risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated  in  a  currency  other  than  the  respective  functional  currencies  of  the Company's entities, primarily the New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) and US Dollars (USD), Chinese Yuan (CNY).  The currencies used in these transactions are denominated in NTD, USD, and CNY.\n\nAt any point in time, the Company hedges specific percentage of its estimated foreign currency exposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following six months. The Company also hedges trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.  The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.\n\nThe  Company designates the spot element of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk and applies a hedge ratio of 1:1. Most of these contracts have a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. The forward elements of forward exchange contracts are excluded from designation as the hedging instrument and are separately accounted for as a cost of hedging. The Company's policy is for the critical terms of the forward exchange contracts to align with the hedged item.\n\nThe Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The Company assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\n## 2) Interest rate risk\n\nThe  Company borrows funds on fixed and variable interest rates, which has a risk exposure to changes in fair value and cash flow. Therefore, the Company manages the interest rates risk by maintaining an adequate combination of fixed and variable interest rates.\n\n## 3) Other price risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from investments in foreign listed equity securities.",
