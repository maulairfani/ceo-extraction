Moller - Maersk fulfils a deep purpose in the world - for society, our customers and our employees. To embed this societal contract in the heart of our business, we articulated and introduced a company purpose in 2022 to inspire and unify our global team.",

        "page_content": "Our Purpose, improving life for all by integrating the world, is the reason we strive to deliver a more connected, agile and sustainable future for global logistics. It's what gets our more than 110,000 colleagues up every morning.\n\nUnderlying our Purpose are our long-held values, and while our values remain constant, we refreshed and revitalised them in 2022 to ensure their continued relevance in the context of a changing world. One of the clearest examples of our values in action was in our response to the tragic war in Ukraine.\n\n## Values in action: Our response to the war in Ukraine\n\nKeeping our colleagues safe has been our first priority in the conflict. We managed to evacuate all colleagues and their families who wanted to leave conflict zones in Ukraine - 148 people in total.\n\nAfter deciding to leave the Russian market and divesting our operations and assets, we also did our upmost to take care of our Russian colleagues.\n\nFinally, we have worked closely with UN partners and global humanitarian organisations to provide extensive aid and relief to millions of displaced people in Ukraine through our logistics bases in Poland and Romania. Our humanitarian efforts are evolving as the conflict continues.\n\n## Strong results and stronger customer partnerships\n\nOur record 2022 results across ocean, logistics and terminals have been accentuated by extraordinary market conditions, supply chain disruptions and congestion. These multifaceted challenges have led many of our customers to rethink and redesign their supply chains - some for the first time in years.\n\nOur transformation efforts to become the integrator of global logistics positioned us well to support our customers through these periods of volatility. As supply chain management moves up our customers' strategic agenda, A.P. Moller - Maersk has earned a seat at the table for more long-term planning focused on connected end-to-end solutions.\n\nOur commitment to our customers has led to record-high NPS results in 2022, which is part of an ongoing story of continuous improvement since the start of the pandemic in Q1 2020. We have also seen a 21% organic revenue growth in logistics and customers who are affirming our strategy by growing their ocean business with us.\n\nAs we enter 2023, we are strongly positioned to solve our customers' current  supply chain needs, as well as their future needs for even more resilient, transparent and climate-neutral supply chains.\n\n## Leading the digital transformation\n\nExtensive parts of the logistics industry have fallen behind the technology revolution of the last decade. Our aim is to contribute with technology solutions that allow us to digitise, integrate and decarbonise global supply chains.\n\nTo achieve that, we are connecting physical assets with the digital world, leveraging the power of digital platforms, IoT and data. Our vision is to use this rich data set to provide end-to-end visibility across global supply chains that allow our customers to make the best possible decisions for their businesses. Specifically, we are striving to not only provide insights into our customers' supply chains, but also offer recommendations and actions for how supply chains can and should be optimised in the future.\n\nHowever, to truly reshape our industry, we will need continued collaboration and standardisation across all parties involved throughout supply chains.\n\n## Making this the decade of climate action\n\nIn 2022, we accelerated the net zero emission targets to 2040 from 2050. We have also set ambitious targets for 2030 and have implemented decarbonisation plans for all our products.\n\nThis decade must be the decade of action if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe. The main challenge in decarbonising global shipping remains the availability of green energy and fuels in sufficient quantities at competitive prices.\n\nTo address that, A.P. Moller - Maersk ordered a new series of container ships with engines that will be powered by green methanol fuel. We also entered into strategic partnerships with nine companies in 2022 with the intent of sourcing at least 750,000 tonnes of green fuel per year by the end of 2025. We have also engaged in dialogues to explore opportunities for large-scale green fuel production in Spain and Egypt.\n\n## Thank you for the continued support\n\nWe are honoured to work alongside all our colleagues around the world. Their truly remarkable efforts have kept trade moving sustainably under very challenging conditions.\n\nWe would also like to thank the Board of Directors and the executive leadership team for the support and many contributions throughout the year. In particular, we express our gratitude to S\u00f8ren Skou, who retired as CEO of A.P. Moller - Maersk in December 2022. During his tenure as CEO, S\u00f8ren was instrumental in redefining A.P. Moller - Maersk as a customer-centric end-to-end logistics provider and a leader in sustainable transportation solutions. A thorough succession planning process ensured that the CEO role was transitioned successfully to Vincent Clerc by January 2023.\n\nAs we enter the new year, with a challenging macro outlook, we remain highly devoted to finding solutions for our customers. With increasingly complex and fragmented global supply chains, we continue to do our upmost to serve their needs. And we thank them for their trust in our services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVincent Clerc\n\nCEO of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S\n\nRobert M\u00e6rsk Uggla\n\nChair of A.P.

The acquisition of LF Logistics closed in 2022 and further increased the warehousing footprint by adding 198 warehouses or 3.1m sqm. Further, Maersk Air Cargo was launched as the combination of the existing in-house operator, Star Air, and a controlled capacity of eight aircraft that will be progressively deployed and operated from H2 2022 and onwards up to 2024.\n\nRead more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Record results in Terminals\n\nREVENUE: USD 4.4bn 9%\n\nTERMINALS' PORTFOLIO: Streamlined with USD 516m of investments to modernise and expand following the divestment of nine terminals (see map)\n\nEBIT adjusted for the Russia exit reaching a record of USD 1.2bn, supported by the continued volume growth and higher storage revenue. Based on a combination of tariff increases and efficiencies, the impact of high global inflation has been mitigated.\n\nRead more\n\n## The exceptional market situation generated record results\n\nMARKET SITUATION: Consumer demand normalised over the course of the year, leading to inventory corrections and lower shipped volumes and freight rates but continued growth opportunities in Logistics & Services and Terminals See page 26 DECADE OF CLIMATE ACTION: Net zero emission targets accelerated to 2040 from 2050 for the entire A.P. Moller - Maersk business and ambitious targets set for 2030   See page 21\n\nIn a continued exceptional market, the high demand eventually started to normalise and freight rates peaked in Q3, which was the 16th quarter in a row with year-on-year earnings growth. The momentum, in bringing integrated logistics solutions by cross-selling Logistics products to existing Ocean customers, remained very strong.   See page 37\n\n## Historically high profitability in Ocean as market began to normalise\n\nREVENUE: USD 64.3bn 33% EBIT: USD 29.1bn 62%\n\nWhile staying focused on finding solutions for Ocean customers, Ocean delivered the strongest result on record due to the high freight rates and strong demand, particularly in the first half of the year. Throughout 2022, Ocean continued to deliver on the strategic transformation, maintaining a stable level of long-term contracts. Ocean continued to improve on delivery performance over the year as congestion eased and strong contractual customer relationship was supportive of margins.\n\n## Volume split on long-haul trades\n\n- Shipments\n- Contracts\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAverage contract rate for 2022 was approx. 1,700 USD/FFE higher than in 2021.\n\nRead more",

Our customers have their headquarters in one part of the world, they source their products in another, and they sell their brands in all markets.\n\nEven when A.P. Moller - Maersk was established nearly 120 years ago, shipping was a facilitator for international trade. We have changed with the world during those many years, adapting not only to customer requests, but also to the changes in technology.\n\nThe container was a low-tech innovation in the 1950s, as was the barcode in the 1970's. And electronic data processing evolved into high-tech information technology, becoming as important for world trade as the ships, the container cranes, the trucks and the warehouses.\n\nRevolutions in shipping are rare, and they take a long time. On our journey, we have moved from steam to diesel, and now we are exploring new fuels to make our customers' supply chains more sustainable. The entrepreneurship of the early years is still part of us, and indeed, it is essential to adapt to the changes in global trade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Peter M\u00e6rsk M\u00f8ller\n\nBased on more than 20 years of experience as a captain on sailing ships, Peter M\u00e6rsk M\u00f8ller acquired a small steam ship in 1886, setting the direction for future generations of the family.\n\n## Arnold Peter M\u00f8ller\n\nStrongly supported by his father, A.P.

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\n2022 marked the fifth year of A.P. Moller - Maersk's transformation from a diversified conglomerate to be the global integrator of container logistics, connecting and simplifying customers' supply chains. Despite the highly dynamic market situation, progress throughout 2022 continued to be strong, with customers rewarding A.P. Moller - Maersk an increasing share of their logistics business. The strength of A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy has carried the Group through two years of significant supply chain disruptions and positioned A.P. Moller - Maersk well to tackle the further challenges its customers and the industry will face in light of the shifting economic outlook.\n\nSince the transformation was initiated in 2016, A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy has been to offer integrated solutions for smooth and optimised cargo flows that can span across all steps of the supply chain and to create value for customers in the form of better supply chain outcomes, increased transparency and control as well as higher efficiencies. The value proposition of integrated logistics, available from a single trusted logistics partner, addresses an underserved need with tangible value for customers. The vision includes the combination of a broad product and service offering of Logistics & Services with a highly reliable and more differentiated Ocean transportation offering. Significant financial and operational synergies are realised between Terminals and Ocean , including leveraging the company's own Ocean volumes to optimise and de-risk terminal operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis strategy is underpinned by cutting edge technology , the Group's industry leading commitment to ESG , not least the Group's commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040 across A.P. Moller - Maersk's businesses, and the Group's highly capable people . The customer-centric mindset, a core element of the Group's strategy, has been substantiated by a strong double-digit percentage growth in cross-brand Net Promoter Score (NPS) at the end of 2022.\n\nThe ability to put the customer first, help them navigate disruptions and absorb the inherent complexity of global logistics is a true differentiator.\n\nBoth the integrator vision and the value proposition have been validated by the substantial business growth experienced with customers, and the strategy's resilience has been proven through disruptions such as COVID-19 and changes in the operating environment. The ability to put the customer first, help them navigate disruptions, and absorb the inherent complexity of global logistics is a true differentiator. Just as A.P. Moller - Maersk's pivotal decision to embrace the container business in the 1970s unlocked decades of growth and made the company a leader in container logistics, A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy to become a global integrator will open a new chapter in the history of A.P. Moller - Maersk and bring the Group to new horizons.",

This drives cost, operational friction, poor reliability, and limited visibility and control for customers. As part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy, the company is building a world-class technology organisation, modernising and standardising its technology platforms, digitising assets and democratising data in an effort to make technology a distinctive and differentiating capability as well as to create customer value. Considerable progress has been made over the past year, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Modernisation of legacy applications and building of new technology platforms, leading to significant improvements in metrics such as critical incidents, system availability and instant booking\n- \u00b7 Process standardisation and product modularisation, leading to improved reliability in delivering on customer needs and achieving higher agility and efficiency\n- \u00b7 Picking up pace in industrial automation and asset digitisation, with improvements in idle time, breakdown time, and labour productivity, as well as better planning and ability to respond to exceptions.\n\nAs part of a continued learning journey of staying focused on creating value for A.P. Moller - Maersk's customers, the company took the decision in 2022 to discontinue TradeLens, the open and neutral supply chain visibility and collaboration platform  created as a joint venture between A.P. Moller - Maersk and IBM in 2018. While TradeLens was unable to secure the necessary traction, A.P. Moller - Maersk continues to be dedicated to a global supply chain digitalisation and collaboration agenda and will leverage the work done as a steppingstone to further push the agenda via different avenues.\n\nWith most of the foundational work that has characterised these first years of the transformation journey rapidly completing, the company is shifting more weight on efforts to build infrastructure and proprietary technology that will create direct value for customers. This includes providing to customers comprehensive visibility of their supply chain along with greater control. Data and AI-optimised solutions are key to this next phase of the transformation journey.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People\n\nThe people working at A.P. Moller - Maersk are essential to its transformation into the global integrator of container logistics. Delivering on the strategy requires building and rebalancing of skills and capabilities across the organisation - especially within logistics and technology - and of the company's DNA, while embedding a culture of customer centricity among thousands of colleagues, current and new.\n\nIn 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk added more than 7,000 new colleagues, the majority into Technology and Logistics & Services teams. Another 14,300 colleagues joined as part of acquisitions, further adding to A.P. Moller - Maersk's capabilities through their successful integration into the Group's fold.\n\nIn order to secure and retain the needed talent, A.P. Moller - Maersk strives to become an employer of choice, offering employees exciting development opportunities and a company environment that values diversity of thought. The company has been building strategic capability academies on Technology and Integrated Supply Chains and has established a Senior Leader Welcome Program to accelerate the onboarding of new leaders and thus the integration of cultures and capabilities, to name a few examples of recent initiatives.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's strong commitment to create an engaging environment for all colleagues remains and steady progress can be seen in the employee engagement  survey, with a score in the 67th percentile, up from 59th at the end of 2021. Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) is a key priority for A.P. Moller - Maersk and core to the Group's People Strategy. Relevant and efficient policies have been established and designed for frontline and office-based colleagues to ensure the highest DE&I standards. They are embedded across the company and empower leaders with tools to drive and champion the DE&I agenda. Multiple supporting initiatives across the entire business have been launched. For further details, see the   2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG\n\nAs a global leader in transport and logistics, A.P. Moller - Maersk takes the responsibility to customers, society and the environment very seriously. ESG is core to the purpose of the Group, an integral part of its business strategy, and a prerequisite for success as the Global Integrator. To demonstrate leadership, A.P. Moller - Maersk has committed to ambitious targets across the dimensions of environment, social and governance, including A.P. Moller - Maersk's industry-leading commitment to net zero carbon emissions across the business by 2040. There has been solid progress on the decarbonisation journey to date, including:",

Moller - Maersk was awarded an A-rating (leadership band) from CDP, and a Gold rating from EcoVadis. This rating is reserved for top 2% of companies within the industry based on their ESG score and is a testament to the Group's dedication to ESG.\n\nFurther details on the A.P. Moller - Maersk ESG agenda and progress can be found in the Sustainability highlights   See page 21.\n\n## Performing while transforming\n\nWith ever stronger enablers above, the key business segments in A.P. Moller - Maersk are more empowered than ever to perform while transforming through foreseeable and unforeseeable circumstances. 2022 was another year during which A.P. Moller - Maersk demonstrated such agility, solidifying its playbook for conducting business as the definition of normalcy evolves more rapidly and unexpectedly as ever. As much as A.P. Moller - Maersk continues to optimise for each business segment's operational and financial performance, it is also increasingly basing business decisions on the customer value a full A.P. Moller - Maersk network with its unmatched scale, connectivity and accessibility can bring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ocean\n\nBuilding and strengthening strategic partnerships with customers is core to A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy, and the Ocean business has consequently been rebalanced towards long-term contracts, stabilising at 70% of volumes for the year. Following years of congestions, reliability is improving again, and A.P. Moller - Maersk has delivered considerable progress in 2022, leading the industry in terms of schedule reliability.\n\nReliability, visibility and resilience are critical requirements customers have for their supply chains - in the face of economic headwinds, geopolitical instability, and accelerating paradigm shifts in the logistics industry, these requirements will become ever more important, and A.P. Moller - Maersk is continuing its focus on providing better solutions to meet those needs.\n\nAs the Ocean market enters a new chapter characterised by a deteriorating supplydemand balance, managing operations is also a sharp focus for the business. This will require frequent and active adjustment of deployed capacity, while ensuring adequate and flexible access for customers to high-quality and reliable Ocean products. At the same time, A.P. Moller - Maersk will continue a disciplined approach to CAPEX, focusing on growing through efficiency and on replacement rather than growing capacity, keeping the fleet at around 4.1-4.3 million TEU.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continues to transform its offering in Ocean in order to provide its customers with differentiated, reliable and high-quality products and services based on individual needs. Doing this will enable customers to better navigate through the upcoming periods of shifting economic conditions and disruptions, while making the Ocean segment a more profitable and resilient business for A.P. Moller - Maersk.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWhat A.P. Moller - Maersk's integrator strategy means for the company's customers is best described through the 'by Maersk' service model value propositions:\n\nWith Managed by Maersk, integrated management solutions enable customers to control or outsource part or all their supply chain. Combining transport and fulfilment solutions with digital platforms, this service model gives end-to-end visibility, actionability and control.\n\nFulfilled by Maersk offer integrated fulfilment solutions to improve customer consolidation and storage down to order level. Whether e-commerce or cold storage, the solutions connect seamlessly to A.P. Moller - Maersk's transportation network, optimising inventory flow and precision to deliver individual orders precisely and on time.\n\nTransported by Maersk offers integrated transportation solutions to facilitate supply chain control across trans  portation steps. The solutions are modular, providing customers end-to-end services with higher reliability, speed and accountability.\n\nManaged by Maersk\n\nFulfilled by Maersk\n\nTransported by Maersk\n\nWhile A.P. Moller - Maersk is still on a journey to build and strengthen these value propositions, the Group has already experienced significant business growth with revenue in 'Transported By Maersk' up by 38%, 'Fulfilled By Maersk' up by 68%, 'Managed By Maersk' up by 48% vs. 2021, demonstrating their increasing relevance to customers. Further more, 77% of Logistics & Services organic revenue growth is coming from top 200 customers, demonstrating the strong synergies between Ocean and Logistics & Services.\n\nAcquisitions have been critical to fill gaps in A.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to provide end-to-end offerings, securing critical know-how, assets and geographic coverage. In 2022, two new acquisitions were announced - Martin Bencher, a Danish-based project logistics business with premium capabilities in designing end-to-end project solutions, and ResQ, a Norwegian supplier of services and expertise in safety training and emergency preparedness - while several acquisitions closed, including Pilot, Senator and LF Logistics. Grindrod Intermodal Group, a proposed joint venture announced in November 2021, and Martin Bencher both closed in January 2023. The integration of LF Logistics - the largest acquisition within logistics - is on-track and has started delivering on financial and operational synergies. A.P. Moller - Maersk expects to continue making acquisitions in order to secure needed capabilities primarily within logistics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerminals are an important part of the end-to-end container shipping supply chain and remain critical for the A.P. Moller - Maersk integrator strategy, enabling network stability while lowering cost to serve its customers. The Terminals segment continues to focus on delivering stable and attractive returns via the Safer, Better, Bigger strategy, while also enabling high-quality Ocean products.\n\nProgress on the strategy has been strong, with Terminals delivering a record-high EBIT result. Adjusted for the divestment of Global Ports Investments in Russia, the 2022 EBIT was USD 1.2 billion, and ROIC was 12.3%.\n\nTerminals continues to see evidence that the Safer, Better, Bigger strategy has further potential to improve underlying performance, while positioning the company to better navigate in an increasingly volatile environment. Despite headwinds, the terminal industry is forecasted to remain attractive and resilient returns are expected to continue.\n\nThe resonance with customers of the integrator strategy and its high-quality integrated supply chain offerings has been very strong, proven by customers rewarding the company with an increasing share of their logistics business.\n\n## Momentum and resonance with the Integrator strategy\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has accelerated its progress on the transformation journey, with strong momentum on building capabilities. The resonance with customers of the integrator strategy and its high-quality integrated supply chain offerings has been very strong, proven by customers rewarding the company with an increasing share of their logistics business and the experienced growth. A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategic positioning and expanding end-to-end value propositions are creating distinct offerings to meet customer needs as they redefine their supply chain for a less stable and more unpredictable world.",

Moller - Maersk defined the roadmaps to drive meaningful progress on the ESG commitments announced in February, with the aim of fully integrating those activities across businesses and into decision making. The company's ESG strategy is an integral part of, and prerequisite for, the success of A.P. Moller - Maersk's Global Integrator strategy. Aggressive decarbonisation targets have been set for 2030 to ensure this critical decade is one of action.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's ESG aspirations are closely linked to the company's Purpose and Core Values, and collaboration with customers, partners and stakeholders at every level aspires to deliver more responsible and more sustainable supply chains, so that global trade makes a positive contribution to the environment and society.",

Moller - Maersk's ESG strategy highlights three core commitments, supported by targets:\n\n- \u00b7 We will take leadership in the decarbonisation of logistics\n- \u00b7 We will ensure that our people thrive at work by providing a safe and inspiring workplace\n- \u00b7 We operate based on responsible business practices.\n\nAround these three commitments, A.P. Moller - Maersk has defined 14 ESG categories covering all material impacts and risks. Each category is owned by an executive sponsor and anchored in relevant functions that drive implementation and performance. The company reports on the strategy, governance and performance across all the 14 categories in the annual Sustainability Report, supplemented by further details, TCFD and SASB index in an online ESG Factbook at   Maersk.com/sustainability. From 2023, ESG will be linked to executive remuneration (see box).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Scorecard based on performance in three categories with a three-year vesting period\n- \u00b7 Represents 20% of Executive Leadership Team long-term incentive (LTI) compensation\n- \u00b7 Effective from 2023 LTI programme\n\n## Environment\n\n## Climate change: taking decisive steps towards net zero by 2040\n\nIn 2022, every region in the world was impacted by powerful warning signs about the dangers of failing to address climate change. This included record heatwaves that made cities uninhabitable and threatened the food supplies of millions. It also included violent storms and widespread wildfires, as well as record drought and flooding.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is a key player in an industry responsible for 3.5 billion tonnes of annual greenhouse gas emissions. With an obligation to be part of the solution, the\n\ncompany is leading the decarbonisation of logistics with a commitment to support a green and just transition, based on respect for human rights, social dialogue, and stakeholder engagement.\n\nIn 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk defined and clarified key milestones in its operations and customer offerings needed by 2030 to keep the journey towards this commitment on track. Activities are progressing at full speed but in different phases, as detailed in the sections covering the Ocean, Logistics & Services and Terminals businesses.\n\nA critical part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's approach to decarbonising supply chains is providing customers with green solutions to help them reach their own targets. Today 70% of the company's top 200 customers have set ambitious greenhouse gas emission goals, including science-based targets - many of which are on aggressive timelines to reach climate neutrality by 2040 or even earlier.\n\n2022 also saw promising developments in industry standards and regulation, which will improve visibility and the industry's ability to gather consistent, granular data to collaborate on shared emissions objectives. In December, the long-awaited Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidance for maritime transport was launched. A.P. Moller - Maersk has long been committed to seek SBTi verification of targets aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and anticipates that this will be accomplished in 2023.\n\nSupportive regulatory frameworks are critical to ensuring a level playing field that will help accelerate innovation and investment in the green transition. The EU and US governments showed strong climate leadership in 2022 through supporting measures for the EU Fit-for-55 package and the US Inflation Reduction Act to catalyse the green transition. Globally, the IMO finalised the adoption of two short-term emission-reducing measures which will be applied from 2023 - the Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and the Carbon Intensity Indicator - the first operational global regulation that will significantly curb vessel emissions.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk supports local measures while continuing to advocate for global rules, including setting higher IMO ambitions for 2030 and 2050, with rigorous implementation. Ensuring that industry decarbonisation efforts include a well-to-wake (life cycle) perspective and look beyond CO 2 to all greenhouse gasses is also critical to creating a level playing field. A.P. Moller - Maersk believes a market-based greenhouse gas price/carbon tax of at least USD 150/tonne is also required to accelerate the green transition and reward decarbonisation investments.\n\n## Ensuring a sustainable green transition\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's approach to securing green fuels requires that all possible environmental and social impacts are fully understood over potential fuels' entire life cycles. Net zero greenhouse gas emissions are only achieved when there is no net addition of greenhouse gasses associated with the fuel from raw material to end of life - e.g. the complete fuel supply chain is fully decarbonised.",

Moller - Maersk assesses the environmental impact of fuels in accordance with the ISO 14040-series standards for life cycle assessment. In addition to climate change, a broad range of environmental indicators are considered, including biodiversity, ecosystem services, resource and material depletion, human health and ecotoxicity, and air and water quality. Social aspects are assessed through a just transition lens that considers the impacts on people and communities in new fuel supply chains.\n\nFull details on A.P. Moller - Maersk's approach to sustainable fuels and a just transition can be found in the 2022 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Green solutions for customers\n\nTo deliver on the 2030 and 2040 targets set for green offerings to customers, A.P. Moller - Maersk is developing products across its business segments. The first one in the market was Maersk ECO Delivery, an ocean transport customer offering that uses green fuels, instead of conventional fossil fuels. Since its 2019 introduction, demand for ECO Delivery Ocean has grown by more than three times, year-on-year. Of the 200 customers currently using the product, 35% are from emerging countries - affirming that decarbonisation is not only on the agenda of mature, wealthy economies. A.P. Moller - Maersk plans to develop and launch more ECO Delivery products across other business segments to ultimately enable end-to-end green solutions.\n\nVisibility of greenhouse gas emissions across supply chains is critical to customers' carbon reduction efforts. A.P. Moller - Maersk has launched an Emissions Dashboard helping customers to simplify the often-complex challenge of consolidating emissions data across multiple carriers and transport modes.\n\n## Social\n\n## Human capital\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to attract, retain and develop talented colleagues at all levels is critical to delivering on the company's Purpose and Global Integrator vision. The People strategy was designed, in alignment with the company's Core Values, to create the right environment to engage and inspire employees to thrive.\n\nDuring 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk made significant progress in rolling out initiatives to support the priorities defined in the People Strategy. These included new talent attraction and onboarding programmes, a strong focus on leadership development, and a new talent management approach closely linked to new career building tools. For 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk's score in the bi-annual Gallup global employee engagement survey\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- one of the most important People KPIs - saw an 8-point year-on-year improvement to the 67th percentile, up from 59th at the end of 2021.\n\n## Safety and security\n\nIn the area of safety and security, A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment is to ensure that everyone gets home safe by preventing fatal and life-altering incidents. In 2022, the company did not live up to that commitment, and with deepest regret, nine people lost their lives while on active duty for A.P. Moller - Maersk.",

Moller - Maersk into an integrated logistics operator, as the company enters more landside business areas and relies on an increasing number of new partners. Four fatalities involved truck drivers - one at a terminal and three in warehouses. In Warehouse and Distribution safety and security risk management, particular focus is therefore on separating people from machines including trucks, forklifts and cranes. Six of the nine fatalities involved third parties, which is leading the company to revisit the control of contractors who enter facilities. A.P. Moller - Maersk's duty of care extends to anyone supporting company operations.\n\nIn 2022, the company further took action to strengthen risk assessments, confirm that critical safeguards are in place and to accelerate the implementation of a new global\n\nHSSE Management Framework that covers Maersk's Ocean & Logistics and Terminals businesses. Globally, A.P. Moller - Maersk continues to focus on building capacity to fail safely, with the aim that if accidents or incidents occur, the safety culture, processes and mitigating actions will prevent them from doing significant harm. This includes targets for two leading indicators, the first around High Potential Incidents as predictors of where there is a heightened risk of fatal or life-altering accidents. By the end of 2023, all High Potential Incidents will trigger a frontline Learning Team assessment. The second is that by the end of 2023, Maersk's 1,200 top leaders will have gone through 'Lead with Care', a comprehensive training programme that forms the core of the company's approach to safety and security, where leaders are fully enabled and personally involved in creating safe workplaces.\n\n## Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)\n\nDE&I is core to creating the right environment for employees and integral to how A.P. Moller - Maersk attracts, retains and engages its talent. This is especially critical to the company's growth ambitions today as it competes for talent in a market driven by global socio-economic trends, including the post-pandemic 'great resignation'.\n\nThe right environment includes psychological safety, and in 2022 the company launched a new, global Anti-Discrimination, Harassment and Bullying Policy followed by mandatory training to strengthen its commitment to a Zero Tolerance Code of Conduct. Ending harassment at sea is a global, industry-wide issue which requires the support of all stakeholders. A.P. Moller - Maersk is working across the ecosystem with labour unions and maritime administrations and academies to address this issue and has also instituted a major cultural transformation programme and campaigns to increase openness to harassment issues and promote a speak-up culture.\n\nGender diversity is another DE&I priority. In 2022, the company made progress in leadership gender diversity by strengthening the pipeline of women leaders and engaging them for development earlier in their careers. A.P. Moller - Maersk has programmes for women at all levels to build leadership skills and around 800 participated in dedicated leader development and networking programmes during 2022. The company is also proactively addressing gender diversity attraction challenges in traditionally male-dominated work environments, including building a more gender-balanced workforce at sea, and in landside growth areas such as warehousing and trucking.\n\nEmployee reference networks are a key DE&I lever for A.P. Moller - Maersk, and many employees participate in groups such as Pride@Maersk and the Maersk Power Women's Network through campaigns around International Women's Day, Summer of Pride, Mental Health Month and International Day of Persons with Disabilities. These networks also create opportunities to partner with customers on activities based on shared values, such as the global journey of A.P. Moller - Maersk's Pride rainbow containers.",

Moller - Maersk's commitment to business ethics is strongly linked to its Purpose and how the company promotes sustainable, responsible trade and a more equal society. In 2022, there were many challenges due to lingering pandemic congestion, large market changes and geopolitical tensions, all of which increase the risk of corruption. These risks include demands for facilitation payments from port, border and landside authorities and for concession requests while negotiating with government officials.\n\nIn 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk made continued progress on its journey towards a best-in-industry compliance programme by 2025, with a focus on enhancing the effectiveness of compliance procedures, digitising controls and identifying risks. Annual compliance training is an important KPI for business ethics to raise awareness of risk areas and confirm understanding of Business Ethics Rules, as summarised in the A.P. Moller - Maersk Code of Conduct - the go-to reference for employees. In 2022, new trainings were launched based on insights from global and function risk assessments. The Code of Conduct was also relaunched in 2022 with a campaign to support a speak-up culture and encourage employees to use the whistleblower system, while reinforcing a zero-tolerance nonretaliation policy.\n\n## Data ethics\n\nThe rapid digitalisation of global supply chains, increased sharing of customer and partner data and growing scrutiny of corporate misuse or failure to protect data have significantly raised the importance of responsible data management.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's global integrator strategy revolves around the ability to offer customers differentiated value propositions from digitally-enabled products and services. The company is committed to demonstrating leadership in technical innovation and to do so with the highest data ethics standards. To avoid abuse and privacy infringement issues, and to safeguard the company from legal, business and reputational risks, it is vital to manage and control the storage and use of customer, partner and employee data ethically and proactively.\n\nIn 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk launched a global training programme covering the four principles of its Data Ethics Policy (transparency, respect, security and innovation), and providing guidance on how to identify and mitigate the risk associated with data-driven innovations throughout the data lifecycle. The company is implementing data management procedures to ensure that risks from emerging topics such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are identified and mitigated early in this age of rapid technology change and development.\n\nExecutive summary   I   The global integrator   I   Performance   I   Governance   I   Financials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\nIn 2022, A.P.

Aligned activities are the share of Maersk's eligible activities that meet both the 'substantial contribution' and 'do no significant harm' criteria outlined in the EU Taxonomy Regulation - a classification system identifying environmentally sustainable economic activities. The results of the 2022 screening confirm that A.P. Moller - Maersk has significant opportunity to make a substantial contribution towards climate change mitigation, and that it is in its early stages of the journey to decarbonise its end-to-end value chain. In 2022, 3.4% of revenue, 7.1% of CAPEX and 10.1% of OPEX are reported as taxonomy-aligned, and 85.2% of revenue, 63.5% of Capex and 100% of Opex are taxonomy-eligible.

        "page_content": "## Market insights\n\nThe economic outlook shifted during 2022. After a strong start to the year, new shocks weighed on economic activity and supply chains. High inflation, inventory build and a rebalancing towards spending on services reduced demand for goods bringing global trade back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nEconomic activity and global trade slowed in 2022 after a strong rebound from the pandemic. A series of new shocks and market dynamics weighed on trade and supply chains. A large part of Russian and Ukrainian imports and exports were eliminated from the market; consumers began to normalise their spending on goods and shifted towards services, while inflation and higher interest rates eroded purchasing power; China's property market weakened, and lockdowns continued to impact activity; and inventory correction in Europe and the United States impacted the demand for ocean and airfreight services. Demand for road transportation remained better supported in the USA and Europe, and warehousing utilisation remained high throughout the year.\n\nIn 2023, economic and trade growth are expected to be weak. Demand for consumer goods is slowing, and the inventory correction is weighing on the near-term outlook. Geopolitics remain challenging, with some long-standing trade relationships being reconfigured. The result is an emerging fundamental reset in which some supply chains are increasingly shaped by political choice.\n\n## Mid-2022 marked a shift in the macroeconomic environment\n\nGlobal economic activity made a strong recover in 2021 (6.0% y-o-y), but slowed to 3% in 2022 (Oxford Economics January 2023 estimate), as the rebound from the pandemic faded. Additionally, the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China created new disruptions and strains during the year. Companies and consumers experienced levels of price inflation not seen since the 1970s, with headline consumer price inflation reaching 9% in the USA (June) and 10.6% in the Eurozone (October), and producer price inflation reaching above 40% in Europe. Many central banks increased interest rates to contain price inflation and slowing economic activity became evident in the second half of 2022 in most major economies. Central banks in China and Japan were an exception, maintaining an accommodative stance to support growth.\n\nSolid labour markets and savings accumulated during the pandemic supported overall consumer demand despite these new headwinds. However, spending on goods began to slow during H2 2022 as the composition of spending shifted toward services, and the\n\nexceptionally strong demand for goods by consumers in the United States began to fade. Alongside, the inventory correction turned into a headwind in H2 2022. Inventories were run down during 2020-21, supporting trade activity as manufacturers and retailers struggled to meet a heavy order flow. With economic activity slowing and supply chain bottlenecks easing during 2022, businesses started to accumulate inventory resulting in a drag on trade activity (Figure 1).\n\n## Logistics markets began to normalise\n\nDemand for logistics services followed the macroeconomic environment during 2022. Global container sea freight volumes declined by 4.3% in 2022, and by the third quarter they were below 2019 Q3 levels. Air cargo volumes (CTK) declined by 7.4% from January to November compared to 2021 (Figure 1) and were also below the levels seen over the same period of 2019. According to Drewry, port throughput volumes declined by 0.5% in 2022, weaker than the 7.1% in 2021. By contrast, vacancy rates for industrial and logistics warehousing remained low by historical standards (3.3% in the USA).\n\n## Inventories and trade\n\nFigure 1\n\n<!-- image -->",

The share of the global container fleet absorbed by delays declined from almost 14% in January 2022 to 6.7% in October, according to Sea-Intelligence. Nonetheless, inland logistics remained challenged in some regions and ports because of several factors: ongoing truck driver and equipment shortages, redirected cargos bound for Russia, low water levels in parts of Europe, high inventory levels clogging-up ports and warehouses, industrial action, flooding in parts of Asia and lockdowns in China.\n\nDemand developments were not uniform across customer verticals. The main shift occurred in retail and technology products where demand was exceptionally strong during the pandemic pushing container volumes well above their pre-pandemic trend (Figure 2). During 2022, consumers reduced their spending on these products and container volumes began to normalise. By contrast, other verticals such as lifestyle products did not experience the same overconsumption and container volumes progressed in line with the prepandemic trend. The automotive sector continued to be impacted by supply chain problems and a shortage of semiconductors, as well as consumer hesitancy, resulting in container\n\n.\n\nSeabury\n\n,\n\nPiers\n\n,\n\nS\n\nCT\n\nbased on\n\n,\n\nes\n\nt\n\nts estima\n\nh\n\nic Insig\n\ng\n\ne\n\nt\n\na\n\ntr\n\ne: Maersk S\n\nc\n\nSour\n\nFigure 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nvolumes being well below trend. From a sales channel perspective, e-commerce penetration also began to normalise during 2022, underscoring the need for nimble omnichannel logistics solutions.\n\nContainer volumes contracted across most ocean routes in 2022 compared to 2021 (Figure 3). Volumes into and out of Europe weakened because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that resulted in a direct loss of trade with Russia and in a deterioration of the European economic environment. Volumes into Far-East Asia deteriorated because of weak domestic demand and COVID-19 policy in China. North America import volumes also declined hand-in-hand with the economic slowdown, shifting consumer demand and the inventory correction. Yet, container volumes remained above 2019 levels in several regions, including Latin America, Oceania, intra-Asia and intra-America.\n\n## Pricing varied across transport modes\n\nThe normalisation of demand was felt most keenly in the ocean freight rate market during H2 2022. The adjustment across other transport modes was more subdued reflecting differing demand and supply dynamics (Figure 4).\n\nSpot ocean freight rates, as measured by the Shanghai Containerized Freight Index (SCFI), were on average 10% lower in 2022 compared to 2021, but still four times higher than 2019.\n\nOn the supply side of the ocean market, nominal capacity expanded by 4% in 2022 and the supply-demand balance deteriorated during the year. In H1 2022, supply side bottlenecks and the composition of demand led to a growing number of blank sailings and a fleet deployment increasingly skewed towards longer East-West trades relative to shorter intra-regional trades. This kept effective supply growth below head-haul demand growth, supporting ocean rates. Combined with weakening demand, the supply-demand balance deteriorated in H2 2022.\n\nLooking forward to 2023, global demand for containers is expected to decline. On the supply side of the container market, growth is expected to be significant. According to Alphaliner 362 vessels with a nominal capacity of 2,482k TEU are scheduled for delivery in 2023. This corresponds to around 10% of the current nominal fleet. Although scrapping and measures taken to comply with incoming regulation from the International Maritime Organization will absorb some of the incoming capacity, the supply-demand balance is likely to deteriorate in 2023.\n\nLower demand for air cargo services and a return of capacity to the market reduced the pressure on airfreight rates during 2022. Compared with the first eleven months of 2021, airfreight capacity rose by 3.3% in 2022 as long-haul passenger flights resumed and expanded carrier freighter fleets came into operation (IATA). Rates remained in transition in H2 2022. As of September 2022, they were 9% below same period 2021, but global average spot rates were 103% higher than in September 2019 according to Xeneta. Continued rate normalisation during 2023 rests on the supply of belly capacity coming to the market and the degree of demand normalisation.",

Higher levels of inventory resulted in increased demand for warehousing and storage space, keeping rates supported. In Europe, road freight rates remained high despite weakening economic activity thanks to a mix of factors such as elevated fuel costs and driver shortages. Yet across all modes, the mix of factors that drove rates higher during and after the pandemic started to unwind during 2022.\n\n## A disrupted market landscape\n\nDespite the easing of COVID-related restrictions, the logistics industry and its customers face wide-ranging changes and disruption to the business landscape.

Immediately ahead, global economic growth is expected to be weak in 2023, around 1.5%, with major economies going into recession. Consumer spending growth will slow further and the overconsumption of goods during the pandemic period risks a sharp correction in demand. China's economy is also struggling, adding to the business challenges posed by COVID-19. And many emerging markets are vulnera ble, having entered this environment with high debt levels and key dependencies on energy and food imports. In this uncertain context, the global ocean container  market growth is expected to be in the range of -2.5% to +0.5% in 2023.\n\nAlongside, market-based trade policies are being challenged more forcefully than at any time in the past 60 years. Going forward, geopolitical relationships are set to remain tense, and some supply chains will be shaped more by political choice than by economics, and by the increasing impact of climate change . The totality of uncertainty facing customers' supply chains and logistics providers is significant and greater than any single risk factor would indicate by itself.\n\nOther fundamental drivers of the logistics landscape are also changing. Technology is creating new demands and opportunities, channel shifts are accelerating, and the quest for resilience and ESG compliance are becoming paramount. As part of the response, supply chains are starting to be rewired through nearshoring and diversification of sourcing, and customers seek closer collaboration and longterm relationships to reduce undue complexity and shared responsibility for operating their supply chains.",

Moller - Maersk is focused to support the strategic objectives in the medium term and ensure the longevity in the long term. A.P. Moller - Maersk's Enterprise Risk Management framework enables a con sistent approach to identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of key risks. This allows a holistic and meaningful comparison of the risks faced and provides transparency of how they are managed across the company.\n\n## Identifying A.P. Moller - Maersk's risks\n\nUsing the enterprise risk management framework, all A.P. Moller - Maersk brands and functions identify risks that could affect their strategy and operations. In parallel, risks to the company's business objectives are identified through interviews with executives. Finally, emerging risks to the company's longer-term value drivers are identified through an externally facilitated workshop with executives. The risks identified are then consolidated into an enterprise-wide risk landscape and validated for relevance and significance by the Risk & Compliance Committee. After final consolidation, the risk landscape is reviewed by the Executive Leadership Team, who determines the key risks for the company and the emerging risks that warrant detailed analysis to understand their potential impact. These risks are then submitted to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Managing A.P. Moller - Maersk's risks\n\nEach key risk is assigned an executive owner who is accountable for the management of the risk, including confirmation that adequate controls are in place and that the necessary action plans are implemented to bring or keep the key risk within risk appetite. To provide adequate oversight, key risk developments and mitigation progress are monitored and reported on throughout the year based on agreed metrics. Quarterly in-dept reviews of the status of the key risks and their mitigation are conducted in the management teams and various oversight fora such as the Risk & Compliance Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee conducts deep dive sessions with executive risk owners throughout the year on selected key risks. Figure 1 presents an overview of A.P. Moller - Maersk's process and governance structures, including the Risk & Compliance Committee and Audit Committee/ Board of Directors.\n\n## ERM road map 2022-2024\n\nIn 2022, a third-party maturity assessment of A.P. Moller - Maersk's Enterprise Risk Management capabilities was carried out. The assessment concludes that the company has a solid ERM  program, which over the past few years has undergone steady and continuous improvement. To further strengthen the capabilities a road map of activities was established for the period 2022-2024 to:\n\n- 1.   Enhance the project risk management capabilities\n- 2.  Establish a risk appetite framework\n- 3.  Address uneven ERM maturity levels in brands and functions\n- 4.  Build system support for ERM.\n\nWork on the above activities is either ongoing or completed.\n\n## Figure 1\n\n## Overview of governance structure\n\n## A.P.

A cyberattack  could lead to severe operational disruption, data  breaches and/or loss of customer trust. | Inflationary cost pressure, unexpected costs   associated with M&A Integration, or lack of product  standardisation, impacts A.P. Moller - Maersk's  profitability. A.P. Moller - Maersk's strategy to become a global  integrator of container logistics requires the right  capabilities. Inability to attract and retain skilled  staff will impact the ambition to deliver a logistics-  based, digitally transformed business model to  support the integrator strategy.                                                                                                                                                                             | Decarbonisation is a business necessity and  a mission-critical factor. It is imperative for  A.P.

        "page_content": "## Looking beyond the planning period\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk looks beyond the business planning horizon and assesses emerging risks in a 5-15 years' perspective. This is to spot threats or opportunities to the long-term value drivers in a timely manner. Emerging risks are established based on prevailing mega trends seen through different lenses (Figure 3). In 2021, two risks were selected for focus and further analysis. These risks were the physical impact of climate change and change in trade patterns. The planned analysis has been performed during 2022, and the outcome is described below.\n\nFigure 3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change\n\nClimate change will increasingly impact global trade. There will be impact on infrastructure and transportation ( the operation side ) and changes to the patterns of economic activity and trade flow ( the demand side ).\n\nThe analysis of the operation side includes assessment of climate scenarios and their impact on the company's operations in relevant locations, i.e. the land-based assets. The risks are assessed for the portfolio of assets and for the individual assets. On average the asset portfolio is predicted to incur 30% higher costs for physical damage and business interruption compared to a baseline of 2022. This does not include the potential impact on the network. For individual assets identified to be high-risk assets, the company is conducting on site assessments by risk engineers of vulnerabilities to relevant climate hazards in the short, medium and long term and provide concrete and actionable recommendations.\n\nIn respect of climate change impact on the future trade flows, the analysis focuses on understanding the demand side , It captures the influence of climate change on where things are made and who buys them. Different climate-economy scenarios have been modelled to determine how global trade and demand for container transport and logistics could be impacted by both a changing climate, the world's mitigation responses and the global economy's response. The findings are that irrespective of efforts to reduce global emissions, the global economy will be harmed in the medium or longer term depending on whether the scenario is a coordinated transition or a disorderly approach, and with a high degree of variation between regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Change in trade patterns\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's business model is global and dependent on the global economy and international trade. Consequently, fundamental changes in trade patterns could expose the current business model to risk. The company is monitoring trends in the global environment leading to fragmentation in the key supply chains. Three main trends are contributing to such fragmentation, 1) The geopolitical competition and supply chain disruptions are\n\nincreasing the interest in re- or near-shoring, 2) Rise in protective industrial policy is leading to government intervention in markets to prioritise local and regional production, 3) Prioritisation of ESG goals is increasing the regulation, impacting businesses and impacting consumer preferences which is expected to lead to avoidance of long-haul transportation and manufacturing closer to market. A study was undertaken to analyse the geopolitical risk. Three scenarios were built with a view on the short-term, medium-term and longterm impact on the supply chains and detailed analyses were done on verticals (customer product segments) that are globally important to trade and strategically important for A.P. Moller - Maersk. The analysis concluded, that on current policy settings the impact on container trade will be manageable. However, certain tail events will increase risks within the scenarios exponentially. These tail risks relate to the geopolitical situation as well as climate change.\n\nEmerging risks in focus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Climate change\n- 2    Change in trade patterns\n\n<!-- image -->",

She hoped to inspire change, and after brainstorming various ideas, Boughner targeted the environment as the core of her efforts.\n\nAfter successfully working on river clean-ups for a couple of years, interest grew and in 2021, a team was created enabling Boughner to expand her efforts. Through rounds of tree plantings and waste collection, Boughner and her allies have continued to support local non-profits. By walking an extra mile outside office hours, they have helped build awareness to the changes and the negative impact facing our environment. Furthermore, these efforts have helped push the necessary change to how societies treat our planet at a time with more extreme weather conditions and rising temperatures.\n\nBoughner and her colleagues are great representatives of A.P. Moller - Maersk and a clear example of the added value of having a purpose in your work. The company formulated a purpose and revitalised its fundamental values in the early days of 2022, which has inspired employees to make a positive impact. More colleagues are joining initiatives like Boughner's engagement team, and at A.P. Moller - Maersk offices around the world, people are researching how to be more involved as local difference makers.\n\nBy walking an extra mile outside office hours, they have helped build awareness to the changes and the negative impact facing our environment.\n\nHaving a purpose beyond growth on profits and meeting the expectations from surrounding stakeholders are major parts of the license to operate as a global company today. Operations at A.P. Moller - Maersk have always been deeply rooted in a set of core values. By clearly defining and updating them to reflect the world of today, A.P. Moller - Maersk is better prepared to meet the world of tomorrow.\n\nIn North Carolina, Zeba Boughner and her colleagues might be making a small difference if measured purely in the number of plastic bottles they prevent from ending up in our oceans.

Revenue increased by 32%, and EBITDA and EBIT increased by 53% and 57%, respectively. Profit was USD 29.3bn (USD 18.0bn) for 2022.\n\nThe exceptional market situation continued in 2022 with profitability driven by the substantially higher freight rates in Ocean, however, freight rates began to decline in the second part of Q3, due to weakening customer demand, coupled with markets beginning to normalise with fewer supply chain disruptions and progressive unwinding of congestion.\n\nDue to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, A.P. Moller - Maersk decided to withdraw from doing business in Russia, and consequently recognised the corresponding value adjustments. The divestment of Terminal's participation in Global Ports Investments (GPI), Russia, was completed in 2022, while the divestment of Maersk Container Industry was discontinued following regulatory challenges.\n\nThe acquisitions of LF Logistics, Pilot Freight Services and Senator International were completed and the intended acquisition of Martin Bencher Group was announced. Further, A.P. Moller - Maersk strengthened its air freight offering by launching Maersk Air Cargo.\n\n## Highlights for the year\n\n|                                              | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   | USD million   |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                              | Revenue       | Revenue       | EBITDA        | EBITDA        | EBIT          | EBIT          | CAPEX         | CAPEX         |\n|                                              | 2022          | 2021          | 2022          | 2021          | 2022          | 2021          | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Ocean                                        | 64,299        | 48,232        | 33,770        | 21,432        | 29,149        | 17,963        | 2,620         | 2,003         |\n| Logistics & Services                         | 14,423        | 9,830         | 1,378         | 907           | 814           | 623           | 657           | 460           |\n| Terminals                                    | 4,371         | 4,000         | 1,535         | 1,455         | 832           | 1,173         | 516           | 304           |\n| Towage &   Maritime Services                 | 2,293         | 2,082         | 369           | 356           | 307           | 17            | 350           | 203           |\n| Unallocated activities,   eliminations, etc. | -3,857        | -2,357        | -239          | -114          | -242          | -102          | 20            | 6             |\n| A.P.

The increase in Ocean was driven by significantly higher loaded freight rates for the first three quarters. The increase in Logistics & Services was primarily due to significant volume growth both organically and inorgani cally, while the increase in Terminals was mainly driven by storage income in North America and continued higher volume.\n\nEBITDA increased significantly to USD 36.8bn (USD 24.0bn). In Ocean, EBITDA increased by USD 12.3bn, driven by higher revenue due to higher freight rates, partly offset by lower volumes and higher costs from increased bunker prices, container handling and network. In Logistics & Services, the increase in EBITDA was USD 471m, led by the higher revenue, and in Terminals, EBITDA increased by USD 80m, positively impacted by higher storage income, volume increase and increase in tariffs.\n\nOcean, USDbn (2021: 21.4)\n\n33.8\n\nLogistics & Services, USDbn\n\n(2021: 907m)\n\n1.4\n\nTerminals, USDbn (2021: 1.5)\n\n1.5\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEBIT increased by USD 11.2bn to USD 30.9bn (USD 19.7bn), positively impacted by the improved EBITDA with a negative impact from the Russia/Ukraine situation of USD 511m.

All else being equal, the sensitivities for 2023 for four key assumptions are listed below:\n\n| Factors                                     | Change                | Effect on EBIT (Full year 2023)   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Container freight rate                      | +/- 100 USD/FFE       | +/- USD 1.2bn                     |\n| Container freight volume                    | +/- 100,000 FFE       | +/- USD 0.1bn                     |\n| Bunker price (net of expected BAF coverage) | +/- 100 USD/tonne     | +/- USD 0.4bn                     |\n| Foreign exchange rate (net of hedges)       | +/- 10% change in USD | +/- USD 0.2bn                     |\n\nESG targets for 2023\n\nESG targets towards 2025\n\nSAFETY & SECURITY\n\n100%\n\nLearning Teams completed following a high potential incident\n\nSUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT, 2024\n\n100%\n\nSuppliers (in scope) committed to the Supplier Code of Conduct\n\n## ESG commitments\n\nA.P.

Moller - Maersk has linked the executive remuneration to ESG performance as of 2023.\n\n## Climate change: The vision to deliver net zero by 2040\n\nA climate emergency demands an emergency response, and A.P. Moller - Maersk has set bold and aggressive targets to decarbonise logistics. This matches what two thirds of the company's largest customers demand, as they themselves have set net zero or science- based targets including scope 3 emissions, which implies their supply chains must be decarbonised.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to having its decarbonisation targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Since the long-awaited methodology for the maritime transport sector has now been launched in late 2022, the company will seek to submit targets for approval by the SBTi in 2023.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThe Annual Report contains forward-looking statements.

A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to leading the decarbonisation of logistics in view of the overall industry being responsible for 3.5bn tonnes of annual greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn January 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk updated its ambitious climate targets, including the objective to reach net zero emissions by 2040. By doing so, the company also addresses customer demand to help businesses across the globe in their efforts to cut emissions. The targets are driving business decisions every day.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk continued to invest to reach its ambitious targets. The company entered into nine green fuel partnerships in 2022, with the intention to source at least 750,000 tonnes of green fuel per year by 2025. In September, A.P. Moller - Maersk announced the purchase of six new green methanol- enabled vessels, adding to the 13 already in the order book. The first green methanolenabled vessel will have its maiden journey in 2023.\n\n## A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed to leading the decarbonisation of logistics.\n\nGovernments, businesses and citizens must all work together to not only set targets and raise ambitions, but also to act accordingly to meet those ambitions. Urgency is needed for the world to turn the tide on climate change and meaningful progress is needed. With a war on European soil, high inflation in North America and Europe and economic turmoil hitting many economies, some might say it is not the time to invest in things like green fuels. But there will probably never be a convenient time to tackle a challenge of this magnitude. A.P. Moller - Maersk is focusing on implementing green solutions of today while continuing to innovate and develop tomorrow's solutions.\n\nTaking care of today while preparing for tomorrow is a core value at A.P. Moller - Maersk, and when it comes to preparing for tomorrow, not many things are as relevant as dealing with the ongoing climate emergency. It is a business opportunity and a duty for a company as A.P. Moller - Maersk to lead the decarbonisation efforts in the industry. That's what gets us up in the morning.",

The average freight rate at fixed bunker increased by 32%, nonetheless, freight rates, in particular shipment or spot rates declined in the second half of 2022, driven by easing of congestions and weakening demand.\n\nTotal operating costs increased by 14% to USD 30.6bn (USD 26.8bn), impacted by higher bunker price and container handling costs from operational congestion and bottlenecks. Container handling costs increased by 4.5%, mainly due to higher container empty costs. Network costs excluding bunker costs increased by 4.5%, mainly due to increases on slot charter costs, partially offset by lower hub and transhipment costs. There was a positive impact from development in foreign exchange rates, and adjusting for this, the operating costs increased by 16.8%.\n\nBunker costs increased by 50% to USD 8.1bn (USD 5.4bn), with an increase in average bunker prices of 58% to 763 USD/tonne (484 USD/tonne), partially offset by a 4.6% decrease in bunker consumption. Bunker efficiency decreased by 1.2% to 41.9 g/TEU*NM (41.4 g/TEU*NM).\n\nUnit cost at fixed bunker increased by 16% to 2,444 USD/FFE (2,102 USD/FFE) driven by higher time-charter equivalent costs, terminal storage costs, transportation costs of empty containers and slot charter costs, while negatively impacted by lower volumes. Adjusting for the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, unit cost at fixed bunker increased by 19%.\n\nThe average operated capacity of 4,285k TEU increased by 2.7%. The newbuilding programme had replacements of eighteen vessels and one feeder vessel capable of running on green fuels at the end of 2022. The fleet consisted of 318 owned and 389 chartered vessels, of which 302k TEU or 7.2% of the fleet were idle (41 vessels), mainly due to repairs.\n\n## '000 TEU",

Despite a reduction in fuel consumption maintaining momentum on carbon intensity in 2022 proved challenging due to ongoing post-pandemic port congestion and capacity shortages which strained and slowed global supply chains.\n\nIn 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk continued investing in its green fuel transition, ordering six additional dual-fuel vessels that can sail on green methanol. In total, A.P. Moller - Maersk now has 19 vessels on order, including one feeder vessel of 2,100 TEU capacity to be launched in 2023, and 18 large ocean going vessels of 16,000-17,200 TEU capacity scheduled for delivery in 2024 and 2025.\n\nSecuring the availability of green fuels at scale is the largest challenge to A.P. Moller - Maersk's decarbonisation ambitions. In 2022, nine strategic partnerships were announced with Memorandums of Understanding that lay the groundwork to securing around 5 million tonnes of green methanol by 2030. Such partnerships are critical to scaling up new fuels in terms of production capacity, technology and business model innovation.\n\nSee the A.P.

Moller - Maersk's emissions from Ocean vessels under its financial control (Scope 1) and upstream and downstream emissions from ocean-related activities in its value chain (Scope 3) are the company's largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. There are two key levers to mitigating A.P. Moller - Maersk ocean-related emissions - improving fuel efficiency and transitioning to vessels operating on green fuels. Green is defined as fuels or energy that, compared to fossil fuels, have low (65-80% less) or very low (80-95% less) greenhouse gas emissions on a life cycle basis.\n\n## 2022 highlights\n\nTotal of 19 vessels on order capable of running on green methanol, first delivery in 2023\n\nOperational, machinery, and hydrodynamic retrofits in Maersk-owned vessels",

This will in turn free up vessel space and improve equipment availability. However, the market remains incredibly volatile and such volatility demands robust planning to make the supply chains as resilient and flexible as possible.\n\n## Keeping flexible operations\n\nDuring 2022, Ocean remained flexible in challenging environments, reflected by the response to record high waiting times at ports, when goods were successfully rerouted to other ports. Continuous improvements resulted in global reliability improving significantly compared to 2021 and is expected to improve further going forward.\n\n## Key initiatives 2022\n\nFocus in 2022 was to increase the quality of Ocean's products, improving the schedule reliability and preparing for a more stable operational environment. Steps were taken to remain agile with placing Ocean equipment, deploying the capacity in the most meaningful way, and offering more flexibility to Ocean customers where challenges would arise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Expanding the offering of Maersk ECO delivery\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk's low emission ECO Delivery product is an Ocean transport customer offering that uses green biofuels, which reduces CO 2 emissions by more than 80%. This product provides direct carbon savings with the use of biofuel. Since its introduction in 2019, customer demand for Maersk ECO Delivery has grown, with volumes that tripled year-on-year.\n\n## Contract products\n\nThe contract product offering has been developed for customers to alleviate volatility of rates and integrate further their supply chains with a relevant offering such as the Value-Added-Services. Companies can go beyond the usual 12-month agreements and secure contracts that last for up to two to five years and be certain that the rates they pay will follow a market index. Time usually spent on re-negotiating contracts every year can be freed up for developing business, taking it to the next level and adding a competitive advantage in com parison to their competitors.

The integration of LF Logistics added 198 warehouses (3,149k sqm) to the warehousing portfolio.\n\nFor the Transported by Maersk services , revenue was up by 38% to USD 8.2bn (USD 5.9bn), driven by an increase in intermodal volumes of 0.8% to 4,526k FFE (4,491k FFE), mainly due to higher volume coming from ocean cargo, higher penetration ratio into existing Ocean customers, and higher rates as well as the integration of Pilot. Further, revenue growth in air was mainly inorganic from Senator, partly offset by demand slowdown and decrease in rates in China post COVID-19 recovery. Overall, air volumes were 29% higher compared to 2021 for a total of 211k tonnes, of which Senator added 89k tonnes.\n\n## Logistics & Services highlights\n\nUSD million\n\n|                                                                                 | 2022    | 2021      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                                         | 14,423  | 9,830     |\n| Direct costs (third party cost)                                                 | 10,717  | 7,396     |\n| Gross profit                                                                    | 3,706   | 2,434     |\n| Direct operating expenses                                                       | 1,482   | 967       |\n| Selling, General & Administration (SG&A) costs                                  | 846     | 560       |\n| Profit before depreciation, amortisation and   impairment losses, etc. (EBITDA) | 1,378   | 907       |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                   | 9.6%    | 9.2%      |\n| Profit after depreciation and impairment losses,   before amortisations (EBITA) | 944     | 678       |\n| EBITA margin                                                                    | 6.5%    | 6.9%      |\n| Profit before financial items (EBIT)                                            | 814     | 623       |\n| EBIT margin                                                                     | 5.6%    | 6.3%      |\n| Invested capital                                                                | 9,858   | 3,130     |\n| Gross capital expenditure, excl. acquisitions   and divestments (CAPEX)         | 657     | 460       |\n| Operational and financial metrics                                               |         |           |\n| EBIT conversion (EBIT/gross profit - %)                                         | 22.0%   | 25.6%     |\n| Managed by Maersk revenue                                                       | 2,343   | 1,578     |\n| Fulfilled by Maersk revenue                                                     | 3,898   | 2,320     |\n| Transported by Maersk revenue                                                   | 8,182   | 5,932     |\n| Supply chain management volumes (kcbm)                                          | 110,264 | 98,394    |\n| Intermodal volumes (kFFE)                                                       | 4,526   | 4,491     |\n| Air freight volumes (tonne)                                                     | 211,484 | 163,838 1 |\n\nGross profit increased by USD 1.3bn to USD 3.7bn (USD 2.4bn) with a margin of 26% (25%), driven by an increase in volumes in Lead Logistics and in the number of declarations handled in Customs Services under Managed by Maersk.

Moller - Maersk worked closely with customers and partners to understand the technically and commercially most promising decarbonisation technologies for the Logistics & Services businesses, including deep dives on technical and energy standards, testing solutions, and how to scale them. Scaling Logistics & Services products requires regional solutions and relies on local policy, capacity and infrastructure.\n\nThe insights from this process helped define a Logistics & Services decarbonisation roadmap and 2030 targets, with several strategic pilots underway. In 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk was in the process of deploying 50 electric trucks in India as an agile solution for reducing logistics vehicle emissions in congested cities. In the USA, A.P. Moller - Maersk deployed 29 heavy-duty electric trucks with an additional 400+ trucks to be delivered by 2025.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk also defined a roadmap for logistics facilities, which especially depends on local availability of renewable energy sources and infrastructure, regulatory support, and supplier willingness to engage. All newbuilt warehouses will aim to achieve LEED Platinum or BREEAM Excellent certification.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has set the high ambition of using 30% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for customer air cargo by 2030. This is a challenging ambition, as SAF, the only practical air cargo decarbonisation option today, is very costly and limited in supply. The industry has a long product development cycle and is subject to extensive regulation. A.P. Moller - Maersk is relying on aviation industry leaders to continue working on breakthrough technologies, with appropriate regulatory support, to create new and commercially viable ways of decarbonising air cargo.\n\nSee the A.P. Moller - Maersk 2022 Sustainability Report for more details, targets and performance data on Logistics & Services decarbonisation progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Terminals demonstrated robust revenue growth, driven by tariff increases and higher storage revenue, despite a global market downturn in the latter part of the year.\n\nLike-for-like volume, adjusting for exits, grew 1.1% in an otherwise shrinking market. While volumes on the US West Coast showed a material decline in Q4, the rest of Terminals' business continued mostly unaffected by concerns of weakening demand. Global congestion, and the resulting storage revenue, had a significant positive effect on Terminals' financials for the first three quarters of the year. In Q4, however, a swift return towards normalisation has been observed with the terminal complex in Los Angeles, USA, being fully decongested while some congestion remains in Elizabeth, USA, keeping Q4 storage income slightly elevated compared to 2020 levels.\n\nRising inflation and high energy costs had a significant effect on both the overall economy and Terminals' costs, with like-for-like cost per move increasing by 10%. Results remained healthy as terminal tariffs increased per local CPI in most locations.\n\nInvestment levels increased as Terminals invested in its existing port folio with a focus on growth, efficiency and automation. This includes over 180 pieces of electric or hybrid equipment. The new greenfield projects in Rijeka, Croatia, and Suape, Brazil, are progressing but not requiring significant capital yet.

Cost per move increased by 8.7% to USD 263 (USD 242) mainly driven by inflationary labour costs, costs related to legal cases and future exits, higher selling, general and administration costs and higher energy prices.\n\nAdjusted for foreign exchange rates, volume mix effects and portfolio changes, revenue per move increased by 13% and cost per move increased by 10%.\n\nWith the increase in revenue per move being only partly offset by the increase in cost per move, EBITDA increased by USD 80m to USD 1.5bn (USD 1.5bn) with an EBITDA margin of 35.1% (36.4%).\n\n## Regional volume\n\nTerminals\n\n| Million moves                  |   2022 |   2021 |   Growth (%) |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------|\n| North America                  |    3.3 |    3.2 |          1.6 |\n| Latin America                  |    2.4 |    2.5 |         -5.4 |\n| Europe, Russia and the Baltics |    2.6 |    2.6 |         -0.5 |\n| Asia                           |    2.6 |    2.5 |          5.2 |\n| Africa and Middle East         |    1.9 |    2   |         -3.1 |\n| Total                          |   12.8 |   12.8 |          0.2 |\n\n## Terminals highlights\n\nUSD million\n\n|                                                                                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                                                        | 4,371  | 4,000  |\n| Concession fees                                                                | 362    | 339    |\n| Labour cost (blue collar)                                                      | 1,270  | 1,151  |\n| Other operational costs                                                        | 638    | 559    |\n| Selling, General & Administration (SG&A) and other costs, etc.                 | 566    | 496    |\n| Total operating costs                                                          | 2,836  | 2,545  |\n| Profit before depreciation, amortisation and  impairment losses, etc. (EBITDA) | 1,535  | 1,455  |\n| EBITDA margin                                                                  | 35.1%  | 36.4%  |\n| Profit before financial items (EBIT)                                           | 832    | 1,173  |\n| EBIT margin                                                                    | 19.0%  | 29.3%  |\n| Invested capital                                                               | 7,593  | 8,289  |\n| Gross capital expenditure, excl. acquisitions   and divestments (CAPEX)        | 516    | 304    |\n| Operational and financial metrics                                              |        |        |\n| Terminal volumes - financially consolidated (moves, m)                         | 12.8   | 12.8   |\n| Ocean segment                                                                  | 4.6    | 4.5    |\n| External customers                                                             | 8.2    | 8.3    |\n| Terminal revenue per move - financially consolidated (USD)                     | 341    | 312    |\n| Terminal cost per move - financially consolidated (USD)                        | 263    | 242    |\n| Result from joint ventures and associated companies (USDm)                     | -46    | 297    |\n\nEBIT decreased to USD 832m (USD 1.2bn) due to the impact of divesting GPI in Russia. EBIT adjusted for the divestment of GPI was USD 1.2bn, USD 62m higher than in 2021.\n\nCAPEX increased to USD 516m (USD 304m), mainly driven by investments into growing and modernising existing terminals, highlighted by the terminal modernisation project in Los Angeles, USA, where 62 additional automated hybrid straddle carriers have been ordered in 2022.\n\nROIC (LTM) declined to 7.6% (10.9%) driven by the divestment of GPI. ROIC adjusted for the GPI divestment was 12.3%.\n\nIn North America, revenue increased driven by volume growth of 1.6% and a 10% increase in revenue per move, partly due to higher congestion-related storage revenue and partly due to CPI-related tariff increases. Cost per move increased by 4.1%, well below inflation, as CPI-driven increases in labour costs, operational costs and higher energy prices were partly offset by scale efficiencies from the higher volumes.",

        "page_content": "## Terminals' investment cycle\n\nThe vast majority of terminals are governed by a time-limited concession agreement, with the current average remaining concession length being 18 years. When or if the concession expires, the facility is given back to the relevant authority or new concession holder. Investment levels often follow either a pre-agreed expansion plan in the concession agreement or a concession extension to ensure that there is a match between investment timeline and concession duration. Over the past four years, Terminals has been able to obtain 90% of the targeted long-term concession extensions (one unsuccessful).\n\n## Average remaining concession length in years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cost split %\n\n- Labour costs (blue collar)\n- Selling, general and administration (SG&A) and other costs, etc.\n- Other operational costs\n- Concession fees\n- Depreciation and amortisation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Latin America, volume decreased by 5.4%, mainly due to Itajai, Brazil, where services were gradually being phased out as the concession was scheduled to end in 2022 (a transition contract was recently awarded, extending the concession to mid-2023) and the divestment of a terminal in Cartagena, Colombia. However, overall revenue improved driven by an increase in revenue per move of 18%, supported by higher tariffs and cargo mix, offset by higher cost per move of 19% driven by future exit costs and higher labour costs.\n\nIn Asia, volume increased by 5.2% driven by Yokohama, Japan, and Pipavav, India, driving up overall revenue despite a drop in revenue per move of 3.1%. Cost per move decreased by 12% mainly due to the negative impact from a cyclone observed in 2021.\n\nIn Europe, volume decreased by 0.5% as strong growth across the region was offset by the temporary volume loss from a terminal operating system upgrade in Valencia, Spain.\n\nTotal revenue increased due to higher storage income and CPI-related tariff increases, driving up revenue per move by 4.1%. Cost per\n\nmove decreased by 0.5%, mainly driven by lower variable concession fees, lower operational cost offset by higher energy prices.\n\nIn Africa and Middle East, volume dropped by 3.1%, mainly due to lower volume in Onne, Nigeria, and Cotonou, Benin, due to increased competition, but overall revenue increased due to an 11% increase in revenue per move on the basis of higher storage income and CPI-related tariff increases. Cost per move increased by 21%, largely driven by exchange rate impacts in Luanda, Angola.\n\n## Results from joint ventures and associated companies\n\nThe share of profit in joint ventures and associated companies decreased to a loss of USD 46m (profit of USD 297m), mainly due to the divestment of GPI. Adjusted for the divestments, share of profit in joint ventures and associated companies was USD 304m, with the remaining part of the GPI impact reported under gains on sale of non-current assets, etc., net.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## BETTER\n\n## Exits\n\nThe portfolio is continuously being reviewed to make sure that Terminals is the best owner for each asset. As a result, Terminals has not pursued a long-term extension for the concession for Itajai, Brazil, and has divested the terminals in Cartagena, Colombia, and Wilhelmshaven, Germany, and Sogester in Angola. Finally, following the decision to exit Russia, GPI was also divested.\n\n## The Safer, Better and Bigger strategy translates into investments\n\nTerminals remains committed to ensuring that everyone returns home safe by preventing fatal and life-altering incidents. While having made good improvements on Safer it remains an ongoing and core task to become incident free.\n\nTerminals has undertaken a significant number of investments and divestments to become Better and Bigger. The actions range from upgrading and modernising existing terminals, constructing new greenfield terminals and divesting facilities which are no longer considered a strategic fit.\n\n## BETTER AND BIGGER\n\n## Upgrading or modernisation projects\n\nThe focus of investments for Terminals in 2022 has been growing and modernising existing terminals. These investments generally pay off faster than new terminal projects. In 2022 and 2023, significant investments and upgrades are being made into nine existing terminals, highlighted by Los Angeles, USA, where additional 62 automated hybrid straddle carriers were ordered in 2022.\n\nBIGGER\n\n## Portfolio Growth\n\nTerminals aim to grow the portfolio selectively, with a priority for locations offering synergies with Ocean. In 2022, a new terminal opened in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, while preparation for construction of a terminal in Rijeka, Croatia, is ongoing. In Suape, Brazil, an area of the port has been acquired with an intention of building a new terminal.\n\n## BETTER\n\n## Remaining gateway terminals\n\nOther terminals where investments are at a relatively smaller scale and typically focused on replacements and improving service levels are Monrovia, Liberia, or smaller-scale pilots for new equipment like in Aarhus, Denmark.",

        "page_content": "Terminals also purchased over 180 pieces of electric or hybrid container handling equipment in 2022. Although the business is taking a global approach to adopting electric equipment, this is challenging with almost 4,000 pieces of equipment in 40 different locations - each with different infrastructure, regulations and concession context. Therefore, local terminal end-to-end roadmaps are being developed, taking advantage of existing products where available and partnering with suppliers to pilot new solutions for locations with less mature options.\n\nTo avoid locking into carbon-based solutions by replacing diesel equipment with new diesel equipment, Terminals is also extending asset lifetimes whenever possible until electric alternatives are available - while prioritising safety and customer commitments.\n\nSee the A.P. Moller - Maersk 2022 Sustainability Report for greater details, targets and performance data on Terminals' decarbonisation progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## DECARBONISATION\n\n## The pathway to decarbonising Terminals\n\nTerminals' pathway to decarbonisation is based on the increased use of renewable energy in owned and operated terminals, including a commitment to reach net zero across all scopes by 2040. This includes a switch to renewable electricity, direct electrification, battery electric mobile equipment, and from fossil to green fuels whenever possible. As a significant share of Terminals' emissions come from purchased electricity, a near-term priority is switching to renewable electricity from on-site or offsite sources. In 2022, Terminals switched to purchasing renewable electricity from local utilities for seven terminals in Europe and one in the USA, and commissioned a 1MW onsite solar plant in Pipapav, India.\n\n## 2022 highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This confirms a strong focus on Brazil as one of the key Latin American markets, where the company has already made significant investments in the past years.\n\nFurther, APM Terminals Mobile signed an agreement with the Alabama State Port Authority, USA, to add 32 acres to the current 134-acre container terminal yard. The first stage of this significant investment is expected to be completed in 2023 and the final stage in 2025. This represents the third expansion in the last six years as USA importers expand to meet regional consumer demand and tap into rail services to the Midwest US market.\n\nIn Jordan, Terminals and the Aqaba Development Cooperation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding for a 15-year extension of their partnership in the Aqaba Container Terminal (ACT).\n\n## Divestments\n\nFollowing the announcement of A.P. Moller - Maersk's commitment to discontinue activities in Russia earlier in 2022, Terminals has divested its entire 30.75% shareholding in Global Ports Investments (GPI) to Terminals' long-standing joint venture partner Delo Group that already owned 30.75% of the shares. The transaction includes an ability for Terminals to re-enter the partnership with Delo in the future.\n\nFurther, Terminals closed the transaction with HapagLloyd which purchased Terminals' 30% shareholding of the Container Terminal Wilhelmshaven (CTW), Germany, in May, and a sale of a 51% stake in the Cartagena Container Terminal, Colombia, was executed in Q1 2022. A 51% share of Sociedade Gestora de Terminais, S.A. in Angola was divested by the end of Q4.\n\n## Key initiatives 2022\n\nTerminals has made significant progress towards becoming the best-in-class operator, upgrading the current portfolio and entering into new locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Automation, digitisation and IT\n\nAs a part of the automation and digitisation programmes almost 2,500 assets are now digitally connected, up from 2,000 by end 2021. This solution enables terminals to monitor and visualise asset performance in real time, detect operational exceptions as they occur, and provide standardised tools and processes to respond to these.\n\nFurther, a new IFS10 ERP system along with standardised working processes have been rolled out in 86% of eligible terminals, with the remaining expected to go live in 2023. As a part of the implementation, underlying finance, procurement, asset maintenance and inventory management are being aligned across operated terminals.\n\n## Major construction work\n\nThe new terminal in Abidjan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, opened in November 2022, after a successful test call in October. The terminal will have a capacity to handle 1.5m TEUs a year, and also features automated gates and an online truck appointment system.\n\nThe new terminal project in Rijeka, Croatia, is progressing as planned and in Onne, Nigeria, the last phase of the terminal upgrade is being finalised. In  Mumbai, India, work continues to upgrade the berth with equipment delivery planned for Q1 2023 increasing the capacity from 2.0m TEU to 2.2m TEU, enabling Terminals to better serve the growing Indian demand.",

Revenue for harbour towage increased by USD 31m driven by increased volumes of 6.1% across all regions and tariffs in Europe, Australia and Americas. Terminal towage revenue increased by USD 3m, primarily impacted by an increase in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region due to tariff adjustments and three additional tugs in Egypt.\n\nEBITDA increased to USD 229m (USD 220m), mainly due to increased revenue, partly offset by increased bunker costs and negative foreign exchange rate development. EBIT decreased to USD 116m (USD 121m), mainly driven by the withdrawal from operations in Russia in Q1 and lower gain on sale of vessels, partly offset by decreased depreciation.\n\nAs a consequence of industrial actions being organised by the employee unions in Australia, Svitzer Australia Pty Ltd gave notice of lockout to maritime unions and crew covered by the National Towage Enterprise Agreement (2016) during November.

EBITDA increased to USD 25m (USD 16m), mainly driven by improved time charter activity and project revenue. EBIT increased to positive USD 16m (negative USD 324m), mainly driven by improved EBITDA, while 2021 was impacted by impairment losses resulting from a strategic review of the fleet and the compatibility towards the green transition.\n\nFor Maersk Container Industry , revenue was USD 499m (USD 690m) with 37% related to third-party customers. EBITDA decreased to USD 54m (USD 69m), and EBIT was USD 22m (USD 78m), both driven by a lower market demand and impacted by the reclassification of Maersk Container Industry from assets held for sale.\n\n## Key initiatives in 2022\n\nMaersk Supply Service signed a newbuild contract for a pioneering wind installation vessel (WIV) with delivery expected in 2025 and was awarded a contract for the Empire Wind Park for installation of wind turbines and Preferred Supplier Agreement for the Beacon Wind Park in the USA.

Share price performance was broadly aligned with global peers, and the share price itself remains well above the historic average as a result of progress on the strategic transformation, the commitment to shareholder returns and a robust balance sheet.\n\nThe Maersk B share price decreased by 33% to DKK 15,620 from its closing price at the end of 2021 of DKK 23,450. Including reinvestment of the dividend paid in March 2022, the total shareholder return over the year was negative 26%. However, since the strategic review of 2016, the total shareholder return has been 168% or 16% annualised per year.\n\nThe Board of Directors pro poses a dividend to the shareholders of 4,300 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 2,500 per share of DKK 1,000).\n\nThe share price ended the year 33% lower than last year, implying a total shareholder return of negative 26% for 2022. The Board of Directors in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S proposes a dividend of DKK 4,300 per share based on a pay-out ratio of 37.5%, corresponding to a dividend yield of 27.5%, which in combination with the previously announced share buy-back programme of USD 3bn for 2023, will bring the total cash distribution to around USD 14bn for 2023 or around 35.5% of the market cap as per end of 2022.\n\nTotal shareholder return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Share price development\n\nThe Maersk B share price decreased by 33% to DKK 15,620 from its closing price at the end of 2021 of DKK 23,450. By comparison, the benchmark indices MSCI Europe Transportation and OMXC25 decreased by 30% and 13%, respectively. The Maersk B share price reached its highest price of DKK 24,800 on 13 January 2022, and its lowest price of DKK 13,250 on 29 September 2022. The total market value of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S was USD 39.1bn or DKK 273bn at the end of 2022. The correction of the share price followed the ongoing normalisation of the Ocean business in the second half of the year and the deterioration of the global economic outlook.\n\n## Share capital\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and are divided into two classes: A shares with voting rights and B shares without voting rights. Each DKK 1,000 A share entitles the holder to two votes.\n\nOn 25 May 2022, the cancellation of 133,779 A-shares and 535,076 B-shares was completed, corresponding to 3.45% of the total share capital in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S before the cancellation of shares.\n\nThe A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S share capital amounts to nominally DKK 18,707,161 divided between 10,334,436 A shares of nominally DKK 1,000 and 8,372,725 B shares of nominally DKK 1,000.\n\n## Share price development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nComparing the de v elopmen t in the t otal shar eholder r eturns sinc e the str a t e g ic r e vie w w as announc ed back in 2016 , the t otal shar eholder r eturn has been 168% or 16% annualised per y ear .",

        "page_content": "## Ownership\n\nThe total number of registered shareholders increased by 12,000 to around 89,000 during 2022. Shareholders with more than 5% of share capital or votes held 57.9% of the share capital, while the 20 largest institutional shareholders together owned around 13.6% of the total share capital and around 32.4% adjusted for the free-float. Danish retail investor holdings were on par with 2021 at around 10.3% of the total share capital.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S holding of treasury shares comprised 5.82% of the share capital at the end of 2022, cf. note 4.1 in the consolidated financial statements, a total of 201,717 A shares and 887,557 B shares.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe dividend policy is an annual pay-out ratio of 30-50% of underlying net result adjusted for gains, impairments and restructurings to be implemented from the financial year 2022.\n\nDistribution to shareholders of excess cash will take place through dividends potentially combined with share buy-backs, and the annual pay-out ratio and distribution will be decided from an evaluation of the outlook, cash flow, capital expenditures for organic CAPEX and merger & acquisition transactions, and target of having an investment grade rating.\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 4,300 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 2,500 per share of DKK 1,000). The proposed dividend payment represents a dividend yield of 27.5% (10.7%) and 37.5% of the net underlying profit, based on the Maersk B share's closing price of DKK 15,620 as of 30 December 2022. Payment is expected to take place on 31 March 2023.\n\n## Capital allocation\n\nThe capital allocation strategy ensures that A.P. Moller - Maersk has sufficient financial flexibility to meet the strategic growth objectives while maximising return to A.P.

Moller - Maersk's focus is on long-term debt in order to minimise the ongoing refinancing risk and secure a solid capital structure over the business cycle. A.P. Moller - Maersk aims at having a diversified debt portfolio, based on funding from debt capital markets, commercial bank debt, export credit agencies and from multilateral agencies.\n\nThe target is to have an average maturity of the debt portfolio (excluding the impact of leases) between four to five years, and that the total amount of debt maturing (excluding the impact of leases) in a single 12-month rolling period should not exceed USD 3bn within the next three years.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nBased on the strong financial performance, in August 2022, the Board of Directors decided to raise the existing share buy-back programme by DKK 7.3bn from DKK 32bn to DKK 39.3bn (or around USD 5bn to USD 6bn). In addition, for the years 2024-2025, the Board of Directors decided to raise the share buy-back programme by USD 500m annually from around USD 2.5bn to USD 3.0bn.\n\nThis increased the total share buy-back programme from USD 10bn to USD 12bn to be carried out in several phases during 2022 to 2025.\n\nOf the planned share buy-back of DKK 39.3bn (around USD 6bn) for the years 2022-2023, A.P. Moller - Maersk has bought back DKK 22.5bn (USD 3.2bn) as of the year-end 2022.\n\nThe decision to increase the share buy-back programme was supported by the strong earnings and free cash flow generation seen in 2022.\n\nThe share buy-back is carried out with the purpose to adjust the capital structure of A.P. Moller - Maersk. At the Annual General Meeting in 2023, it will be proposed that shares which are not used for hedging purposes for the long-term incentive programmes are to be cancelled.\n\nNo shares may be bought back at a price exceeding the higher of i) share price of latest independent trade and ii) the highest current independent bid at NASDAQ Copenhagen at the time of trading.\n\nThe maximum number of A and B shares that may be purchased on each trading day may not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of A and B shares, respectively, on NASDAQ Copenhagen or other regulated markets, on which the purchase is carried out, over the last 20 trading days prior to the date of purchase.\n\nA and B shares will be acquired in a 20/80 split reflecting the current trading volumes of the two share classes.\n\nThe company will fulfil its reporting obligations by announcing no later than every seventh trading day the purchases made under the share buy-back programme.\n\nThe company is entitled to suspend or stop the programme at any time subject to an announcement to NASDAQ Copenhagen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial calendar\n\n| 28 MARCH    | Annual General Meeting   |\n|-------------|--------------------------|\n| 04 MAY      | Interim Report Q1 2023   |\n| 04 AUGUST   | Interim Report Q2 2023   |\n| 03 NOVEMBER | Interim Report Q3 2023   |\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting will be held on 28 March 2023 as a virtual event.\n\n## Investor Relations\n\nInvestor Relations works to ensure that both domestic and international investors are kept updated on the latest corporate developments.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the Executive Board members for the financial year 2022 reflects a year in which A.P. Moller - Maersk delivered record-breaking financial results and made a strong progress towards its strategic transformation. The remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors reflects changes to the composition of the Board of Directors.\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has made the choice to take an active part in enabling the global shipping industry to deliver on the Paris Agreement and for A.P. Moller - Maersk to achieve its 2040 net zero target. Underlining the importance of delivering on this commitment, the company is from 2023 introducing an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) measure in the long-term incentive plan. The company will ensure to fully align and integrate the right ESG targets to deliver on its commitments.\n\nThe following sections set out key elements of the Remuneration Policy ('Policy'), and the total remuneration awarded to the members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board for 2022.\n\n## Remuneration policy at a glance\n\nThe Policy supports the business needs by enabling an appropriate total remuneration package that has a clear link to business strategy and aligns with shareholder interests.\n\n## The objectives of the Policy are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure appropriate total remuneration : The remuneration design and decisions are guided by market practice, reflected in the remuneration components offered and the total remuneration value provided.\n- \u00b7 Link to business strategy : The Policy supports the business plan and the need for executive leaders to focus on delivering an ongoing progress to achieve the company's strategic goals, reflected in a combination of shortand long-term incentive components.\n- \u00b7 Align with shareholder interest : The Policy is designed to support the delivery of strong financial and operational results over time, which ultimately grow shareholder value.\n\nThe current Policy applies to members of the Executive Board and the Board of Directors and was adopted at the company's Annual General Meeting in 2022.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors receive a fixed annual fee which is differentiated based on the role:\n\n- \u00b7 Ordinary Board members receive a fixed amount, and the Chair and Vice Chair receives fixed multiples thereof.\n\nBoard of Directors members serving on the Board committees or performing ad hoc work beyond the normal responsibilities receive an additional fee. This does not apply to the Chair where the fixed annual fee is all inclusive.\n\n## Executive Board\n\n## Total remuneration 2022\n\nThe remuneration of the Executive Board members consists of a fixed base salary, which is inclusive of company pension contribution and car, shortterm incentive as well as long-term incentive components.\n\nThe remuneration structure is intended to drive a 'reward for performance' culture by aligning individual reward to company performance and shareholder value creation. The individual remuneration level is set and reviewed based on peer companies of similar size and complexity to ensure they remain comparable and fit for the business.\n\nThe table shows the total remuneration awarded to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board in aggregate from 2018 to 2022, as set out in note 2.2 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nFurther information regarding the sharebased payments is detailed in note 5.2 of the consolidated financial statements as calculated under IFRS 2.\n\nThis is different in both reporting and methodology in the company's Remuneration Report 2022, which is available at the company's website on: investor.maersk.com/remuneration\n\n## 2018-2022 Remuneration\n\n| Remuneration awarded (USD million)                                                       | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Board of Directors                                                                       |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Fixed annual fee                                                                         | 2      | 3      | 3      | 3      | 3      |\n| Total                                                                                    | 2      | 3      | 3      | 3      | 3      |\n| Executive Board                                                                          |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Fixed base salary                                                                        | 8      | 9      | 8      | 10     | 10     |\n| Short-term cash incentive                                                                | 6      | 8      | 6      | 5      | 5      |\n| Long-term share-based incentives 1                                                       | 8      | 3      | 2      | 1      | 1      |\n| Remuneration in connection with redundancy,   resignations and release from duty to work | 8      | -      | -      | 6      | 4      |\n| Total                                                                                    | 30     | 20     | 16     | 22     | 20     |\n\n- 1  During 2022, it was announced that Morten H. Engelstoft would leave A.P. Moller - Maersk effective end June 2022 and S\u00f8ren Skou effective end December 2022. In accordance with the terms and conditions of the restricted share plan and the stock option plan, any remaining expenses related to previous years' plans are accelerated and recognised in 2022 for plans that are kept, and previously recognised expenses are reversed for cancelled plans. This has resulted in an increase in the long-term share-based incentives remuneration in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Basis of preparation\n\nThis section sets out general accounting policies for the Group that relate to the financial statements as a whole. Where an accounting policy is generally applicable to a specific note to the financial statements, the policy is described within that note. In addition, this section describes the significant accounting estimates and judgements that management has identified as having a potentially material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. Reference is made to the specific note in the financial statements which is impacted by the significant accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nFurther, details are provided on the new accounting pronouncements that the Group will adopt in future years and the Group's current view of the impact such pronouncements will have on the financial reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.1\n\nGeneral accounting policies  .................................................................................\n\n85\n\n## Note 1.1 General accounting policies\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for 2022 for A.P. Moller - Maersk have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of A.P. Moller - Maersk are included in the consolidated financial statements of A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2021, except for the changes to accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2022 and were endorsed by the EU. The changes have not had a material impact on the financial statements.\n\n## ESEF/iXBRL reporting\n\nA.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S is required to prepare and file the annual report in the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF), and the annual report for 2022 is therefore prepared in the XHTML format that can be displayed in a standard browser. The primary statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements are tagged using inline eXtensible Business Reporting Language (iXBRL). The iXBRL tags comply with the ESEF taxonomy, which is included in the ESEF Regulation and developed based on the IFRS taxonomy published by the IFRS Foundation. Where a financial statement line item or note is not defined in the ESEF taxonomy, an extension to the taxonomy has been created. Extensions are anchored to elements in the ESEF taxonomy, except for extensions which are subtotals.\n\nThe Annual Report submitted to the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority consists of the XHTML document together with certain technical files, all included in a file named APMM-2022-12-31-en.zip.\n\n## Change in reportable segments\n\nAs part of the refinement of A.P. Moller - Maersk's segment structure, changes to the segment structure were made with effect from 1 January 2022. The changes involve moving the Svitzer activity from Terminals & Towage to Manufacturing & Others. In addition, the Manufacturing & Others segment has been renamed\n\nTowage & Maritime Services, while the Terminals & Towage segment has been renamed Terminals. Comparison figures for Note 2.1 Segment information have been restated as if the change had been implemented in 2021. The reportable segments are disclosed below.\n\nThe allocation of business activities into segments reflects A.P. Moller - Maersk's character as an integrated container logistics business and is in line with the internal management reporting.\n\nThe reportable segments are as follows:\n\n## Ocean\n\n## Logistics & Services\n\nTerminals\n\nGateway terminal activities\n\nTowage & Maritime Services\n\nTowage and related marine activities, production of reefer containers, providing offshore supply service and trading and other businesses\n\n## Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the parent company A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S, its subsidiaries and proportionate shares in joint arrangements classified as joint operations.\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S. Control is based on the power to direct the relevant activities of an entity and the exposure, or right, to variable returns arising from it. In that connection, relevant activities are those that significantly affect the investee's returns. Control is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or in other ways controlling more than 50% of the voting rights or by other rights, such as agreements on management control. Joint arrangements are entities in which\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk, according to contractual agreements with one or more other parties, has joint control.\n\nGlobal container shipping activities, including strategic transhipment hubs and sale of bunker oil\n\nIntegrated transportation, fulfilment and management solutions, including landside and air transportation as well as warehousing and supply chain management offerings",

        "page_content": "## Note 1.1 General accounting policies - continued\n\nThe arrangements are classified as joint ventures, if the contracting parties' rights are limited to net assets in the separate legal entities, and as joint operations, if the parties have direct and unlimited rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nEntities in which A.P. Moller - Maersk exercises a significant but non-controlling influence are considered associated companies. A significant influence is usually achieved by directly or indirectly owning or controlling 20-50% of the voting rights. Agreements and other circumstances are considered when assessing the degree of influence.\n\nConsolidation is performed by summarising the financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries in accordance with A.P. Moller - Maersk's accounting policies. Intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, intra-group balances and gains on intra-group transactions are eliminated. Unrealised gains on transactions with associated companies and joint arrangements are eliminated in proportion to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ownership share. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way unless they indicate impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests' share of profit/loss for the year and of equity in subsidiaries is included as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's profit and equity respectively but shown as separate items.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, the functional currency of the parent company and the Group. In the translation to the presentation currency for subsidiaries, associates, or joint arrangements with functional currencies other than USD, the total comprehensive income is translated into USD at average exchange rates, and the balance sheet is translated at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Exchange rate differences arising from such translations are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and in a separate reserve of equity.\n\nThe functional currency varies from business area to business area. For A.P. Moller - Maersk's principal shipping activities, the functional currency is typically USD. This means, among other things, that the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment\n\nand intangible assets and, hence, depreciation and amortisation, are maintained in USD from the date of acquisition. For other activities, including container terminal activities and land-based logistics activities, the functional currency is generally the local currency of the country in which such activities are performed, unless circumstances suggest a different currency is appropriate.\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items in foreign currencies not settled at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate as at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the income statement as financial income or expenses.\n\nShare of profit/loss in associated companies and joint ventures is recognised net of tax and corrected for the share of unrealised intra-group gains and losses. The item also comprises any impairment losses for such investments and their reversal.\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income\n\nOther comprehensive income consists of gains and losses not recognised in the income statement, including exchange rate adjustments arising from the translation from functional currency to presentation currency, fair value adjustments of other equity investments (at FVOCI), cash flow hedges, forward points and currency basis spread as well as actuarial gains/losses on defined benefit plans, etc. A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of other comprehensive income in associated companies and joint ventures is also included.\n\nOn disposal or discontinuation of an entity, A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the accumulated exchange rate adjustment relating to the relevant entity with a functional currency other than USD, is reclassified to the income statement. Accumulated value adjustments of equity instruments classified as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income will remain in equity upon disposal.\n\nOther comprehensive income includes current and deferred income tax to the extent that the items recognised in other comprehensive income are taxable or deductible.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures are recognised as A.P. Moller - Maersk's share of the equity value inclusive of goodwill less any impairment losses. Goodwill is an integral part of the value of associated companies and joint ventures and is therefore subject to an impairment test together with the investment. Impairment losses are reversed to the extent the original value is considered recoverable.\n\nEquity instruments, etc., including shares, bonds and similar securities, are recognised on the trading date at fair value, and subsequently measured at the quoted market price for listed securities and at estimated fair value for non-listed securities. Fair value adjustments from equity investments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) remain in equity upon disposal. Dividends are recognised in the income statement.\n\nInventories mainly consist of bunker, spare parts not qualifying for property, plant and equipment, and other consumables. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value, primarily according to the FIFO method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress includes direct and indirect production costs.\n\nLoans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus any direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For loans and other receivables, writedowns are made for expected losses based on specific individual or group assessments. For trade receivables, the loss allowance is measured by the simplified approach according to IFRS 9, applying a provision matrix to calculate the expected lifetime losses. The provision matrix includes an impairment for non-due receivables.\n\n## Climate-related risks\n\nWhen preparing the consolidated financial statements, management considers climate-related risks, where these could potentially impact reported amounts materially. The areas in which A.P. Moller - Maersk has assessed climate-related risks at the end of 2022 are included within the individual notes outlined below:\n\nNote 3.2 - Property, plant and equipment\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk has not yet adopted the following accounting standards and requirements:\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance contracts: An analysis of the impact has been made and it has been assessed that the standard will not have a significant impact on recognition and measurement of the Group.\n\nOther changes to IFRS are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.",

        "page_content": "## Note 1.2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis and to form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its estimates and judgements based on historical experience, independent advice, external data points as well as on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nIn its assumption setting, management deals with various aspects of uncertainty. One aspect of uncertainty is the assessment of control over investments classified as associates, joint ventures and subsidiaries, where the assessment forms the basis for classification. Another aspect is measurement uncertainty, where management makes assumptions that derive the value of recognised assets and liabilities. These assumptions\n\nconcern the timing and amount of future cash flows as well as the risks inherent in these.\n\nIn certain areas, the outcome of business plans, including ongoing negotiations with external parties to execute those plans or the outcome of negotiations to settle claims that are raised against A.P.

Moller - Maersk's character as an integrated container logistics business and is in line with the internal management reporting. The reportable segments are as follows:\n\n## Ocean\n\nGlobal container shipping activities, including strategic transhipment hubs and sale of bunker oil\n\n## Logistics & Services\n\nIntegrated transportation, fulfilment and management solutions, including landside and air transportation as well as warehousing and supply chain management offerings\n\nTerminals\n\nGateway terminal activities\n\nTowage & Maritime Services\n\nTowage and related marine activities, production of reefer containers, providing offshore supply service and trading and other businesses\n\nOperating segments have not been aggregated. The reportable segments comprise:\n\n## Ocean\n\nOcean activities\n\nActivities under Maersk Line, Hamburg S\u00fcd, Sealand - A Maersk company, and Alian\u00e7a with ocean container freight being the main revenue stream. Ocean container freight is defined as the cost-per-weight measure of transporting goods on board a container vessel across the ocean, including demurrage and detention, terminal handling, documentation services, container services as well as container storage.\n\n## Hub activities\n\nActivities under the APM Terminals brand-generating revenue by providing port services only in major transhipment ports such as Maasvlakte-II, Algeciras, Tangier,\n\nTangier-Med II, Port Said, and joint ventures in Salalah and Tanjung Pelepas. The respective terminals are included under the Ocean segment, as the primary purpose of those ports is to provide transhipment services to A.P. Moller - Maersk's Ocean business, whereas thirdparty volumes sold in those locations are considered secondary.\n\n## Maersk Oil Trading\n\nSourcing marine fuels for A.P. Moller - Maersk's fleet and third-party customers, in addition to operating a fuel infrastructure in key bunker ports.\n\n## Logistics & Services\n\nManaged by Maersk\n\nService the supply chain with Lead Logistics (Supply Chain Management and 4PL), Cold Chain logistics and Custom Services, enabling customers to control or outsource part of or all their supply chain.\n\n## Fulfilled by Maersk\n\nActivities such as Contract Logistics (Warehousing, Distribution and Depot) and e-commerce supporting integrated fulfilment solutions, to improve customer consolidation.\n\n## Transported by Maersk\n\nIntegrated transportation solutions supported by Landside Transportation (Intermodal and Intercontinental Rail), Value Protect, Air & Less Than Container Load (LCL), Full Container Load (FCL) and Maersk Air Cargo, to facilitate supply chain control across A.P. Moller - Maersk.\n\n## Terminals\n\nTerminals activities\n\nActivities in ports fully or partially controlled by the APM Terminals brand, with the main revenue stream being port activities not considered a hub activity as described above.\n\n## Towage & Maritime Services\n\nTowage activities\n\nActivities under the Svitzer brand, a provider of offshore towage, salvage and marine services.\n\nMaersk Container Industry\n\nManufacturer that produces reefer containers.\n\n## Maersk Supply Service\n\nProvides marine services and integrated solutions to the energy sector worldwide with a large fleet of anchor handling tug supply vessels and subsea support vessels.\n\n## Other businesses\n\nConsists of Maersk Growth, Maersk Training and other services to the maritime industry.\n\n## Unallocated items\n\nThe reportable segments do not comprise Group- related costs in A.P. Moller - Maersk's corporate functions. These functions are reported as unallocated items.\n\nRevenue between segments is limited, except for the Terminals segment, where a large part of the services is delivered to the Ocean segment as well as the sale of containers from Maersk Container Industry to the Ocean segment.\n\n## Income statement\n\nRevenue for all businesses is recognised when the performance obligation has been satisfied, which happens upon the transfer of control to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the goods and services.\n\nRevenue from shipping activities is recognised over time as the performance obligation is satisfied, including a share of revenue from incomplete voyages at the balance sheet date. Invoiced revenue related to an estimated proportion of remaining voyage time and activities at the destination port is deferred. Percentage of completion is calculated as the number of days of a voyage as a percentage of the total number of days a voyage is estimated to last. Detention and demurrage fees are recognised over time up until the time of the customer's late return or pick-up of containers.\n\nRevenue from terminal operations and towing activities is recognised upon completion of the service. In container terminals operated under certain restrictive terms of pricing and service, etc., the value of tangible\n\nassets constructed on behalf of the concession grantor is recognised as revenue during the construction. Revenue from most freight forwarding activities is recognised over time.\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of control to the buyer.\n\nNo significant element of financing is deemed present as sales are made with a credit term of 20-45 days, which is consistent with market practice. Revenue from sales is recognised based on the price specified in the contract, net of the estimated volume discounts. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts, using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.",

Moller - Maersk mainly consist of financial due diligence and transaction advice, accounting advisory services, tax advice, and other advisory accounting and tax services.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Vessel-sharing agreements (cost-sharing arrangements)\n\nVessel-sharing agreements in shipping require that some vessels are committed towards specific service routes. The committed vessel's capacity is then shared with one or more container shipping providers in proportion to each party's contribution to the joint service. In practice, it is not always possible to provide tonnage precisely as\n\nagreed in the sharing arrangements, therefore financial settlement often takes place on basis of relative capacity over/under-utilised on a monthly or other mutually agreed cycle. At A.P. Moller - Maersk, these capacity adjustments are settled as close to actual costs incurred as possible based on market rates applicable at that time.\n\n## Note 2.3  Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses, net\n\n|                                                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total depreciation                                    | 5,595  | 4,315  |\n| Total amortisation                                    | 365    | 277    |\n| Total impairment, net                                 | 226    | 352    |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses, net | 6,186  | 4,944  |\n\nDepreciation is primarily related to property, plant, and equipment of USD 2.5bn (USD 2.3bn) and to right-of-use assets of USD 3.1bn (USD 2.0bn).

Losses in 2022 are primarily related to the sale of containers of USD 25m (USD 20m) and the wind down of operations in Russia. For more information on the Russia/Ukraine impact, refer to note 2.5 Russia/Ukraine impact.\n\n## Note 2.5  Russia/Ukraine impact\n\nDue to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk decided to withdraw from doing business in Russia. Since the decision was made in Q1 2022, A.P. Moller - Maersk has continued the process of winding down operations in Russia with the intent to ultimately leave the country.\n\nAs a result, the recoverable amounts of assets in Russia and Ukraine were reassessed, impairment losses were recognised, and provisions were made to cover costs relating to the withdrawal from operations. The income statement in 2022 was negatively impacted by USD 511m.\n\nIn Terminals, A.P. Moller - Maersk divested its minority stake of 30.75% of Global Ports Investments (GPI). The divestment led to a total impairment loss of USD 403m, including the related recycling of translation reserve loss and other related impairments. Of this, USD 350m is recognised as share of profit/loss from joint ventures and associated companies in the income statement and USD 53m is recognised as gains on sale of non-current assets, etc., net. In Ocean, A.P. Moller - Maersk terminated all cargo operations in Russian ports. This negatively impacted the income statement by USD 41m, mainly due to impairments of containers and receivables. In Logistics & Services, two warehouses have been fully impaired, and all services to and from Russia and Belarus have been suspended. The total negative impact in Logistics & Services was USD 49m. Svitzer has a single operation in Russia providing towage services. Svitzer has taken steps to divest its operations including four tugs. All assets have been impaired with a negative impact to the income statement of USD 18m.\n\nExcept for the divestment of GPI, the impacts have been classified as non-cash items in the cash flow statement.\n\nThe details of the income statement impact are as follows:\n\n|                               |                                                                                                  |   12M |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Operating segment             | Impacted area                                                                                    |  2022 |\n| Ocean                         | Net impairments of containers, net write-down of receivables, provisions                         |   -41 |\n| Logistics & Services          | Net impairments of warehouses, net write-down of receivables, provisions                         |   -49 |\n| Terminals                     | Net impairments of investment in joint venture, including recycling of translation  reserve loss |  -403 |\n| Towage & Maritime  Services   | Impairments of tugboats                                                                          |   -18 |\n| Total income statement impact | Total income statement impact                                                                    |  -511 |\n\n## 3. Invested capital\n\nInvested capital is primarily made up of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. The intangible assets mainly consist of goodwill, terminal and concession rights and customer relationships. Goodwill arises when the Group acquires a business and pays a higher amount than the fair value of its net assets, primarily due to the synergies the Group expect to create. Goodwill is not amortised, but is subject to annual impairment reviews.\n\nFor further details refer to 'Significant accounting estimates and judgements' within note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   3.1 | Intangible assets  ....................................................................................................           | 93   |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n|   3.2 | Property, plant and equipment  ...........................................................................                        | 95   |\n|   3.3 | Right-of-use assets  ...............................................................................................              | 97   |\n|   3.4 | Acquisition/sale of subsidiaries and activities  ..................................................                               | 98   |\n|   3.5 | Term deposits  .........................................................................................................  100     |      |\n|   3.6 | Assets held for sale or distribution  .....................................................................  100                  |      |\n|   3.7 | Provisions  ................................................................................................................  101 |      |",

Ocean operates its fleet of container vessels and hub terminals in an integrated network. Consequently, the Ocean activities are tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit.\n\nLogistics & Services, including intermodal activities, is considered one cash-generating unit as a result of the continued integration within the business. Management views the Logistics & Services products as an integrated network, with the activities tested for impairment as a single cash-generating unit.\n\nIn Terminals, each terminal is considered an individual cash-generating unit for impairment tests, except when the capacity is managed as a portfolio.\n\nTowage & Maritime Services includes towage activities made up of two separate cash-generating units as well as several individual businesses which are each considered one cash-generating unit.\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\nImpairment - assessment inputs\n\nThe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its value in use or fair value less costs to sell. The estimated value in use is calculated using certain key assumptions for the expected future cash flows and applied discount factor. Current market values for vessels, etc., are estimated using acknowledged brokers.\n\nProjected cash flow models are used when fair value is not obtainable or when fair value is deemed lower than value in use.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and business plans approved by management. In nature, these projections are subject to judgement and estimates that are uncertain, though based on\n\nTerminals under APM Terminals located in oil-producing countries, e.g., Nigeria and Brazil, are indirectly impacted by the development in oil prices and the consequences for the respective countries' economies, which not only affects volumes handled in the terminals, but also foreign exchange rates. Continued economic deterioration and a lack of cash repatriation opportunities in certain oil-producing countries could also put pressure on the carrying amounts of individual terminals.\n\nThe key sensitivities impacting Terminals include container moves, revenue and cost per move, and local port rates, all of which are impacted by the local economic outlook and competition, as well as concession right extensions and the discount rate applied.\n\nInflation is also expected to have a higher impact across of A.P. Moller - Maersk in 2023 than in 2022 and in prior years.\n\n## Impairment - results of impairment assessments\n\nIn Ocean, the cash flow projection is based on forecasts as per Q3 2022, covering five-year business plans for 2023-27. Management has applied an assumption of growth in volumes based on a calculated terminal value with growth equal to the expected economic growth of 2.5% (2.0%) p.a., based on pressure on freight rates, and continued cost efficiency. A pre-tax discount rate of 9.2% (7.2%) p.a. has been applied. The impairment test showed headroom between the value in use and the carrying amount. Management is of the opinion that the assumptions applied are sustainable.\n\nThe most significant goodwill amount relates to the Logistics & Services segment, where the impairment test is based on the estimated value in use from fiveyear business plans for 2022-27, where the volume and margin growth assumptions, which are regionally specific, reflect the current market expectations for the relevant period. The applied terminal growth is 2% (2%). A discount rate of 8.4% (6.8%) p.a. pre-tax or 8.2% (6.6%) p.a. after tax has been applied. The impairment test showed headroom from the value in use to the carrying amount.\n\nIn Terminals, management assesses indicators of impairment including decreasing volumes and based on these indicators, estimates the recoverable amounts of the individual terminals whereby impairment indicators\n\nexist. Management also tests for impairment of the CGUs to which goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets are allocated.\n\nThe cash flow projections for each terminal cover the concession period and extension options deemed likely to be exercised. The growth rates assumed reflect current market expectations for the relevant period, and the discount rates applied are between 7.2% and 13.0% (5.9% and 10.6%) p.a. after tax.\n\nIn addition, during Q1 2022, as a result of A.P. Moller - Maersk's decision to withdraw from doing business in Russia, Terminals recognised impairment of USD 485m on its minority stake in Global Ports Investments (GPI). During Q3 2022, APM Terminals sold its holding in GPI, resulting in the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses of USD 135m. Net impairment losses recognised on GPI during 2022 are USD 350m. For further details, reference is made to note 2.5 Russia/Ukraine impact.\n\nThe impairment tests considered fair value less cost of disposal compared to the carrying amount, and resulted in net impairment of USD 350m on GPI as well as impairment losses on assets of an immaterial amount in two terminals in 2022 (impairment losses of an immaterial amount in three terminals were recognised in 2021).\n\nexperience and external sources where available. Centralised processes and involvement of corporate functions ensure that indices and data sources are selected consistently while observing differences in risks and other circumstances.\n\nThe discount rates applied reflect the time value of money as well as the specific risks related to the underlying cash flows, i.e., project and/or country- specific risk premium. The discount rate also takes into consideration development in sustainable technologies. Further, any uncertainties reflecting past performance and possible variations in the amount or timing of the projected cash flows are generally reflected in the discount rates.\n\n## Impairment - key assumptions applied\n\nThe outcome of impairment tests is subject to estimates of the future development of freight rates and volumes, oil prices and the discount rates applied.\n\nManagement determines the key assumptions for each impairment test by considering past experience as well as market analysis and future expectations based on supply and demand trends. The future development in freight rates is an uncertain and significant factor impacting the Ocean segment in particular, whose financial results are directly affected by fluctuations in container freight rates. Freight rates are expected to be influenced by regional and global economic environments, trade patterns, and by industry- specific trends in respect of capacity supply and demand.\n\nAs the market has started on its path to normalisation, shipment and contract rates have begun to see a decline in 2022 and are expected to continue to decline, until part way through 2023. The overall volume growth outlook is flat in 2023 and is expected to increase from 2024 onwards.\n\nThe future development in the oil price is also an uncertain and significant factor impacting accounting estimates across A.P. Moller - Maersk, either directly or indirectly. Ocean is directly impacted by the bunker oil price, where the competitive landscape determines the extent to which the development is reflected in the freight rates charged to the customer. Bunker consumption is expected to reduce compared to 2022, driven by fleet outsourcing and efficiency improvements.",

Amortisation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life. For container terminals operated under certain restrictive price and service conditions, etc., concessional rights to collect usage charges are included under intangible assets. The cost includes the present value of minimum payments under concession agreements and the cost of property, plant, and equipment constructed on behalf of the grantor of a concession. The rights are amortised from the commencement of operations over the concession period. The concession period ranges from 10 to 34 years, with an average of 17 years.\n\nIntangible assets regarding acquired customer relationships and technology are amortised over a useful life of 10-22 years and 5-10 years, respectively. Internally developed IT software is amortised over a useful life of 5 years.\n\n## Note 3.2  Property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                              | Ships,   aircraft,  con tainers,  etc.   | Production  facilities and   equipment,  etc.   | Construction  work in   progress and  payment on  account   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Cost                                         |                                          |                                                 |                                                             |         |\n| 1 January 2022                               | 47,804                                   | 7,946                                           | 1,177                                                       | 56,927  |\n| Additions from acquired companies            | 1                                        | 200                                             | 9                                                           | 210     |\n| Additions                                    | 1,507                                    | 169                                             | 1,965                                                       | 3,641   |\n| Disposals                                    | 1,075                                    | 124                                             | -

When there is an indication of a change in an asset's useful life, management revises the estimates for individual assets or groups of assets with similar characteristics due to factors such as quality of maintenance and repair, technical development, or environmental requirements. Management has also considered the impact of decarbonisation and climate-related risks on useful lives of existing assets. Such risks include new climate-related legislation restricting the use of certain assets, new technology demanded by climate-related\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProperty, plant, and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the useful life at an estimated residual value. The useful lives of new assets are typically as follows:\n\n| Ships, etc.                                               | 20-25 years                                     |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Containers, etc.                                          | 15 years                                        |\n| Buildings                                                 | 10-50 years                                     |\n| Terminal infrastructure                                   | 10-30 years or con-  cession period, if shorter |\n| Warehouses and related   infrastructure                   | 5-25 years, or lease term,  if shorter          |\n| Aircraft and related   components                         | 3-30 years                                      |\n| Plant and machinery, cranes  and other terminal equipment | 5-25 years                                      |\n| Other operating equipment,  fixtures, etc.                | 3-7 years                                       |\n\nlegislation, and the increase in restoration costs for terminal sites due to new and/or more comprehensive policies.\n\nResidual values of vessels are difficult to estimate given their long useful lives, the uncertainty of future economic conditions, and the uncertainty of future steel prices, which is considered the main determinant of the residual value. Generally, the residual values of vessels are initially estimated at 10% of the purchase price excluding dry-docking costs. The long-term view is prioritised in order to disregard to the extent possible, temporary market fluctuations which may be significant.\n\nEstimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed on a regular basis.\n\nThe cost of an asset is divided into separate components, which are depreciated separately if the useful life of the individual component differs. Dry-docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of ships when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry-docking.\n\nThe cost of assets constructed by A.P. Moller - Maersk includes directly attributable expenses. For assets with a long construction period, borrowing costs during the construction period from specific as well as general borrowings are attributed to cost. In addition, the cost includes the net present value of estimated costs of removal and restoration.",

In some cases, the leasing agreements comprise purchase options exercisable by the Group and options for extending the lease term. The Group also enters into arrangements that provide the right-to-use some existing infrastructure or land as required to carry out the terminal business.\n\nTo optimise lease costs during the contract period, the Group sometimes provides residual value guarantees in relation to equipment leases. At the end of 2022, the expected residual values were reviewed if these reflect the actual residual values achieved on comparable assets and expectations about future prices. At 31 December 2022, USD 226m (USD 226m) is expected to be payable and is included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nLeases to which A.P. Moller - Maersk is committed but for which lease term has not yet commenced have an undiscounted value of USD 1.6bn (USD 2.7bn). They comprise approx. 31 contracts commencing in 2023 to 2024. Certain terminal concession agreements contain variable payment terms that are linked to future performance, i.e., number of containers handled. Such payments are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\nLease liabilities are disclosed in notes 4.2 and 4.5.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRight-of-use assets are mainly leased vessels, containers, concessions arrangements and real estate property. Lease contracts for vessels and containers are typically made for fixed periods of about five years, but may have extension options as described together with lease liabilities. Concession arrangements and real estate contracts are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of terms and conditions.\n\nLeases are recognised as a right-of-use asset with a corresponding lease liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.",

Identifiable intangible assets are rec ognised if they arise from a contractual right or can other wise be separately identified. The difference between the fair value of the acquisition cost and the fair value of acquired identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value and any subsequent changes to contingent consideration are recognised as financial income or financial expense in the income statement. If contingent consideration is settled by issuing a predetermined number\n\nof shares, the contingent consideration is classified as equity and is subsequently not remeasured at fair value. Transaction costs are recognised as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nWhen A.P. Moller - Maersk ceases to have control of a subsidiary, the value of any retained investment is re-measured at fair value, and the value adjustment is recognised in the income statement as a gain/loss on the sale of non-current assets. The difference between sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the subsidiary is recognised in the income statement including fair value of contingent consideration at the time of sale. Contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value with changes recognised in the income statement. The effect of the purchase and sale of non-controlling interests without changes in control is included directly in equity.\n\n## Note 3.5  Term deposits\n\nLoan receivables, current, amount to USD 17.7bn (USD 5.1bn) and consist primarily of term deposits with a maturity of more than three months, amounting to USD 17.6bn (USD 5.0bn).

Assets are classified as held for sale when activities to carry out a sale have been initiated, when the activities are available for immediate sale in their present condition, and when the activities are expected to be disposed of within 12 months. Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities.\n\nAssets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount immediately before classification as held for sale and fair value less costs to sell. Impairment tests are performed immediately before classification as\n\nheld for sale. Non-current assets are not depreciated or amortised while classified as held for sale. Measurement of deferred tax and financial assets and liabilities is unchanged.\n\nWhen an asset or a disposal group has been classified as held for sale or distribution, but the requirements are no longer met, the assets and related liabilities ceases to be classified as held for sale. The cessation of the classification as held for sale will be reflected in the period in which the change of circumstances has occurred. Comparative figures are not restated, and any adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale are recognised in the period in which the circumstances have changed.",

Diluted earnings per share are adjusted for the dilutive effect of the average number of share options outstanding issued by the parent company.\n\nEquity includes total comprehensive income for the year comprising the profit for the year and other comprehensive income. Proceeds on the purchase and sale of treasury shares and dividend from such shares are recognised in equity.\n\n|                                       | Net debt as at   31 December   | Cash   flows   | Non-cash changes   | Non-cash changes   | Non-cash changes                   | Non-cash changes                 | Non-cash changes   | Net debt as at   31 December   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                       | 2021                           |                | Addi-  tions       | Disposals          | Transfers,  assets  held for  sale | Foreign   exchange  move-  ments | Other 1            | 2022                           |\n| Bank and other  credit institutions 2 | 1,443                          | -999           | 612                | -

Moller - Maersk will exercise the options. These terms are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing contracts. In determining the lease term, management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended or not terminated. Most of the extension and termination options held are exercisable only by A.P. Moller - Maersk and not by the respective lessor. This assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs, which affects this assessment, and which is within the control of the lessee. Where A.P. Moller - Maersk will probably exercise specific purchase options, those options are included in the measurement of the lease liability with corresponding right-of-use asset depreciated over the asset's useful life rather than lease term.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs. Subsequently, the financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, whereby transaction costs and any premium or discount are recognised as financial expenses over the term of the liabilities. Fixed interest loans subject to fair value hedge accounting are measured at amortised cost with an adjustment for the fair value of the hedged interest component.\n\nLease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term, at the interest rate implicit in the lease, or at A.P. Moller - Maersk's incremental borrowing rate (IBR). A.P. Moller - Maersk's IBR reflects the Group's credit risk, leased amount, and contract duration, as well as the nature and quality of the asset's security and economic environment in which the leased assets operate. To determine the IBR, where possible, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, with adjustments to reflect changes in financing conditions since that financing was received. Where such financing is not available, A.P. Moller - Maersk uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk- free interest rate adjusted by credit risk and specific risks faced by the lessee such as asset type, geographical risks, etc.\n\nSubsequently, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost with each lease payment allocated between the repayment of the liability and financing cost. The finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period, using the IBR that was used to discount the lease payments.",

Generally, the pension plans within the Group are defined contribution plans, where contributions are recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis. A number of entities have defined benefit plans, in which retirement benefits are based on length of service and salary level. To a limited extent, these defined benefit plans also include payment of medical expenses, etc.\n\nIn 2023, the Group expects to pay contributions totalling USD 25m (USD 36m) to funded defined benefit plans.\n\nThe majority of the Group's defined benefit liabilities are 74% in the UK and 13% in the USA. All of the plans in the UK and the majority of the plans in the USA are funded. Although all of the UK plans are now closed to new entrants, active members in the two largest plans continue to accrue new benefits. The smaller UK plans are all closed to new accruals, although a salary link remains in some of the plans.\n\nOverall, the plans have an average duration of 12 years, and approximately 62% of the obligation is in respect of pensioner members.\n\nAs well as being subject to the risks of falling interest rates, which would increase the obligation, poor asset returns and pensioners living longer than anticipated, the Group is also subject to the risk of higher-than- expected inflation. This is because many pension benefits, particularly in the UK plans, increase in line with inflation although some minimum and maximum limits apply.\n\n|                              |   31 December |   31 December |   31 December |   31 December |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Life expectancy              |        2022   |        2042   |        2021   |        2041   |\n| 65-year-old male in the UK   |          22   |          23.5 |          21.9 |          23.3 |\n| 65-year-old female in the UK |          24.3 |          25.8 |          24.2 |          25.5 |\n\nThe sensitivity of the liabilities and pension costs to the key assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Sensitivities for key assumptions in the UK Factors   | 'Change in liability'                  |   Increase 2022 |   Decrease 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Discount rate                                         | Increase/(decrease) by 25 basis points |             -43 |              45 |\n| Inflation rate                                        | Increase/(decrease) by 25 basis points |              24 |             -20 |\n| Life expectancy                                       | Increase/(decrease) by one year        |              63 |             -62 |\n\n| Specification of plan assets   | UK 2022   |   Other 2022 | Total 2022   | UK 2021   |   Other 2021 | Total 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Insurance contracts            | 1,172     |           54 | 1,226        | 1,829     |           68 | 1,897        |\n| Shares                         | 52        |           15 | 67           | 81        |          100 | 181          |\n| Government bonds               | 130       |           37 | 167          | 203       |          117 | 320          |\n| Corporate bonds                | 53        |          176 | 229          | 199       |          100 | 299          |\n| Real estate                    | 8         |            6 | 14           | 9         |            7 | 16           |\n| Other assets                   | 168       |           13 | 181          | 131       |           14 | 145          |\n| Fair value 31 December         | 1,583     |          301 | 1,884        | 2,452     |          406 | 2,858        |\n\nRates of life expectancy reflect the most recent mortality investigations, and in line with market practice an allowance is made for future improvements in life expectancy. The Group assumes that future improvements will be in line with the latest projections of 1.25% for all UK plans.\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using assumptions that are the Group's best estimate of future experience bearing in mind the requirements of IAS 19.\n\nThe Group's plans are funded in accordance with applicable local legislation. In the UK, each plan has a Trustee Board that is required to act in the best interests of plan members. Every three years, a formal valuation of the plan's liabilities is carried out using a prudent basis, and if the plan is in deficit, the Trustees agree with the Group or the sponsoring employer on a plan for recovering that deficit.\n\nAround 85% of the UK liabilities are now covered by insurance policies. Therefore, movement in the liabilities due to change in assumptions would equally impact the assets value related to the buy-in policies, resulting in a reduced movement in the overall balance sheet position.",

In most of the UK plans, any surplus remaining after the last member dies may be returned to the Group. However, the Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund (MNRPF), and the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund (MNOPF) contributions paid by the Group are not refundable in any circumstance and the balance sheet liability reflects an adjustment for any agreed deficit recovery contributions in excess of deficit determined using the Group's assumptions. In 2022 an adjustment of USD 3m (USD 3m) was applied in this respect.\n\nOther than the insurance contracts and a small proportion of other holdings, the plan assets held by the Group are quoted investments.\n\n| Change in net liability                                  | Present   value of   obligations   | Fair value   of plan   assets   | Adjust- ments   | Net   liability   | Of which: UK   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| 1 January 2022                                           | 2,843                              | 2,858                           | 82              | 67                | -138           |\n| Current service cost, administration cost etc.           | 23                                 | -11                             | -

In general, the contributions to the schemes are based on man hours worked or cargo tonnage handled, or a combination hereof.\n\nFor the defined benefit pension plans, the Group has joint and several liabilities to fund total obligations. While the welfare/medical plans are by nature contribution plans funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. In 2022, the Group's contributions to the pension and welfare/medical plans are estimated at USD 124m (USD 97m) and USD 371m (USD 320m), respectively. The contributions to be paid in 2023 are estimated at USD 125m (USD 97m) for the pension plans and USD 374m (USD 335m) for the welfare/medical plans.\n\nNo reliable basis exists for allocation of the schemes' obligations and plan assets to individual employer participants. For the pension plans where the Group has an interest and there is a deficit, the net obligations for all employer's amount to USD 19m (USD 97m). This net obligation is based on the most recent available financial data from the plan's trustees, calculated in accordance with the rules for such actuarial calculation in US GAAP. The deficit in some of the schemes may necessitate increased contributions in the future. Welfare/medical plans are pay-as-you-go and form a part of the Group's US collective bargaining agreements. They cover a limited part of employees' medical costs as occurred.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPension obligations are the net liabilities of defined benefit obligations and the dedicated assets adjusted for the effect of minimum funding and asset ceiling requirements. Plans with a funding surplus are presented as net assets on the balance sheet. The defined benefit obligations are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the balance sheet date. Plan assets are measured at fair value. The pension cost charged to the income statement consists of calculated amounts for vested benefits and interest in addition to\n\n## Note 4.4  Financial income and expenses\n\n|                                                                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest expenses on liabilities 1,4                                  | 815    | 813    |\n| Borrowing costs capitalised on assets 2                               | 49     | 5      |\n| Interest income on loans and receivables                              | 436    | 52     |\n| Fair value adjustment transferred from equity hedge reserve (loss)    | 33     | 37     |\n| Net interest expenses                                                 | 363    | 793    |\n| Exchange rate gains on bank balances, borrowings and working capital  | 596    | 385    |\n| Exchange rate losses on bank balances, borrowings and working capital | 586    | 374    |\n| Net foreign exchange gains/losses                                     | 10     | 11     |\n| Fair value gains from derivatives                                     | 54     | 102    |\n| Fair value losses from derivatives                                    | 319    | 251    |\n| Net fair value gains/losses                                           | -265   | -149   |\n| Dividends received from securities 3                                  | -      | 1      |\n| Gains on payable contingent consideration                             | -      | 3      |\n| Impairment losses on financial assets                                 | 13     | 26     |\n| Reversal of impairment losses on financial assets                     | 2      | 9      |\n| Financial expenses, net                                               | 629    | 944    |\n| Of which:                                                             |        |        |\n| Financial income                                                      | 1,088  | 552    |\n| Financial expenses                                                    | 1,717  | 1,496  |\n\n- 1  Of which USD 518m (USD 459m) relates to interest expense on lease liabilities.\n- 2  The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation is 4.6% (3.3%).\n- 3  Of which USD 0m (USD 1m) pertains to shares held at the end of the year and USD 0m (USD 0m) pertains to shares sold during the year.\n- 4  Of which USD 0m (USD 37m) relates to expense from prepayment of issued bonds.\n\nFor an analysis of gains and losses from derivatives, reference is made to note 4.5.\n\nsettlement of gains or losses, etc. Interest on plan assets is calculated with the same rates as used for discounting the obligations.

The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's entities.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2022. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.\n\nHedges comprise primarily currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives, which are further described in the following sections.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group's currency risk relates to the fact that while income from Ocean activities is denominated mainly in USD, the related expenses are incurred in both USD and a wide range of other currencies such as EUR, DKK, HKD, SGD, and CAD. As the net income is in USD, this is also the primary financing currency. Income and expenses from other activities, are mainly denominated in local currencies, thus reducing the Group's exposure to these currencies.\n\nThe main purpose of hedging the Group's currency risk is to hedge the USD value of the Group's net cash flow and reduce fluctuations in the Group's profit. The Group uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\nCurrency derivatives hedge future revenue, operating costs and investments/divestments, and are recognised on an ongoing basis in the income statement and the cost of property, plant and equipment, respectively. There is not any proxy hedging for the currency risk hedging, and therefore the economic relationship between the hedged exposure and the hedge is high. Effectiveness is assessed using the critical terms match approach according to IFRS 9.\n\nHedges of future revenue and operating costs matures within a year (matures within a year). Hedges of investments matures within a year (matures within a year).\n\nFor hedges related to operating cash flows and investments, a gain of USD 94m in 2022 (loss of USD 150m) is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the cash flow hedge reserve amounts to a gain of USD 53m at 31 December (loss of USD 41m). For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the forward points are recognised in other comprehensive income and transferred with the effective hedge when the hedged transaction occurs. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to USD 0m (USD 0m). There was no ineffectiveness in 2022 (no ineffectiveness).\n\nBesides the designated cash flow hedges in the table, the Group uses derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss. The average FX hedge rates for swaps in cash flow hedge were EUR/USD 1.18 (1.18), GBP/USD 1.52 (1.52), USD/NOK 8.25 (8.25) and USD/SEK 8.88 (8.88). The average FX hedge rates for swaps in combined fair value hedge were EUR/USD 1.24 (1.24), GBP/USD 1.52 (1.52), USD/NOK 8.25 (8.25), and USD/JPY 119.39 (119.39).",

The Group strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nThe hedging of interest rate risk is governed by a range of gross debt paying fixed interest. The level at 31 December is 43% (41%) excluding IFRS 16 leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, positively by approx. USD 215m (positively by USD 152m) and positively by approx. USD 199m (positively by USD 146m), respectively.\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 15m (gain of USD 6m).",

quantities and stored for processing and re-sale. The oil price risk arising from these oil price exposures is mitigated by entering into commodity derivative agreements. The overall exposure limit is set in the Group's risk policy, defining a maximum net open position for the Group. On 31 December 2022, the Group has entered into oil derivative positions shown in the table.",

To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing the expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. In accordance with IFRS 9, non-due trade receivables have also been considered for impairment.\n\nApproximately 31% (44%) of the provision for bad debt is related to trade receivables overdue by more than one year.\n\n## Other financial assets at amortised cost\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost comprise loans receivable, finance lease receivables and other receivables. These financial assets are considered to have low credit risk, and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have a low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\n## Financial institutions\n\nDeposits and bank balances are primarily held in relationship banks with a credit rating of at least A-. No individual counter-party exposure is above 10%. A.P. Moller - Maersk has ISDA agreements for trading of derivatives, under which the Group has a right to net settlement in the event of certain credit events. This results in the credit risk being limited to the net position per counterparty.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\n| Net interest-bearing debt and liquidity reserve      | 2022    | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Borrowings                                           | 15,643  | 15,335 |\n| Net interest-bearing debt (net cash position)        | -12,632 | -1,530 |\n| Cash and bank balances                               | 10,057  | 11,832 |\n| Restricted cash                                      | -1,358  | -1,319 |\n| Term deposits not included in cash and cash balances | 17,615  | 5,025  |\n| Securities                                           | 942     | 3      |\n| Undrawn revolving credit facilities > 12 months      | 6,000   | 6,000  |\n| Liquidity reserve 1                                  | 33,256  | 21,541 |\n\nFor information about cash and bank balances in countries with exchange control or other restrictions, please see text to the consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nBased on the liquidity reserve, loans for the financing of specific assets, the maturity of outstanding loans, and the current investment profile, the Group's financial resources are deemed satisfactory.\n\nThe average term to maturity of loan facilities in the Group was about five years (about six years) at 31 December 2022.",

 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\n- Level 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices) and\n\nLevel 3 -  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nFair value of listed securities is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities are within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives is mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on observable market data as of the end of the reporting period. A minor amount of crude oil price derivatives is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the Group's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated based on discounted future cash flows.\n\n## Other equity investments (FVOCI)\n\nThe Group has investments in equity shares of both listed and non-listed companies. The Group holds non-controlling interests (between 0.1% and 15%) in these companies. These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature.",

Moller - Maersk's activities and result in a stable annual tax liability.\n\nGiven that the liability to tonnage tax is not impacted by financial profits, and is payable even in loss-making years, the effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly.\n\nFurther, disclosures are given on other statutory information not directly related to the operating activities of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   5.1 | Tax and deferred tax  ..............................................................................................  115     |\n|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   5.2 | Share-based payments  .........................................................................................  117          |\n|   5.3 | Commitments   .........................................................................................................  118  |\n|   5.4 | Contingent liabilities  ..............................................................................................  119   |\n|   5.5 | Cash flow specifications  .......................................................................................  119        |\n|   5.6 | Related parties  .......................................................................................................  120 |\n|   5.7 | Subsequent events  ................................................................................................  120      |\n\n## Note 5.1  Tax and deferred tax\n\n|                                                                  | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Tax recognised in the income statement                           |         |         |\n| Current tax on profits for the year                              | 782     | 582     |\n| Adjustment for current tax of prior periods                      | 44      | 93      |\n| Utilisation of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets       | -23     | -6      |\n| Total current tax                                                | 803     | 669     |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences                | -143    | -58     |\n| Adjustment for deferred tax of prior periods                     | 49      | 10      |\n| Adjustment attributable to changes in tax rates and laws         | -       | -5      |\n| Recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets       | -       | -79     |\n| Reassessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets, net       | 1       | 22      |\n| Total deferred tax                                               | -93     | -110    |\n| Total income tax                                                 | 710     | 559     |\n| Tonnage and freight tax                                          | 200     | 138     |\n| Total tax expense                                                | 910     | 697     |\n| Tax reconciliation                                               |         |         |\n| Profit/loss before tax                                           | 30,231  | 18,730  |\n| Profit/loss subject to Danish and foreign tonnage taxation, etc. | -28,999 | -17,578 |\n| Share of profit/loss in joint ventures                           | 192     | -162    |\n| Share of profit/loss in associated companies                     | -324    | -324    |\n| Profit/loss before tax, adjusted                                 | 1,100   | 666     |\n| Tax using the Danish corporation tax rate (22%)                  | 242     | 147     |\n| Tax rate deviations in foreign jurisdictions                     | 31      | 55      |\n| Non-taxable income                                               | -21     | -41     |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                          | 171     | 153     |\n| Adjustment to previous years' taxes                              | 94      | 103     |\n| Effect of changed tax rate                                       | -       | -5      |\n| Change in recoverability of deferred tax assets                  | -22     | -63     |\n| Deferred tax asset not recognised                                | 29      | 42      |\n| Other differences, net                                           | 186     | 168     |\n| Total income tax                                                 | 710     | 559     |\n| Effective tax rate                                               | 3.0%    | 3.7%    |\n| Tax recognised in other comprehensive income and equity          | -20     | -       |\n| Of which: Current tax                                            | -26     | 9       |\n| Deferred tax                                                     | 6       | -9      |",

There are no substantial unrecognised tax liabilities on investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures.\n\n## Taxation of activities\n\nAs a global integrator of container logistics, A.P. Moller - Maersk generates profits from ocean, air or land-based activities. The land-based activities, which are subject to normal corporate income tax, include terminals, logistics, services and shipping agencies through which the Group operate one of the world's most comprehensive port and integrated\n\nlogistics service networks. The logistics products include transportation, warehousing and distribution including cold storage, customs services and supply chain management services. This expanding land-based activity has prompted the establishment and acquisition of entities in numerous countries.\n\nOn the ocean, A.P. Moller - Maersk moves over 26m TEUs every year and operates 700+ vessels delivering cargo to every corner of the globe, including dry cargo commodities, refrigerated cargo and dangerous cargo. This ocean activity, which represents the vast majority of the Group's current revenues, may be subject to special shipping tax rules, including tonnage and freight taxes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Significant accounting estimates\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nJudgement has been applied with respect to A.P. Moller - Maersk's ability to utilise deferred tax assets. Management considers the likelihood of utilisation based on the latest business plans and the recent financial performances of the individual entities. Net deferred tax assets recognised in entities having recognised an accounting loss in either the current or preceding period amount to USD 163m (USD 124m). These assets mainly relate to the tax value of the difference between the accounting value and the fair market value of the bond debt as well as to unused tax losses or deductible temporary differences generated during the construction of terminals, where taxable profits have been generated either in the current period or are expected to be generated within the foreseeable future.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax comprises an estimate of current and deferred income tax as well as adjustments to previous years taxes. Income tax is tax on taxable profits, and consists of corporation tax, withholding tax of dividends, etc. In addition, tax comprises tonnage tax. Tonnage tax is classified as tax when creditable in, or paid in lieu of, income tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement to the extent that it arises from items recognised in the income statement, including tax on gains on intra-group transactions that have been eliminated in the consolidation.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax is not recognised for differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, where at the time of the transaction neither accounting nor taxable profit/loss is affected, unless the differences arise in a business combination. In addition, no deferred tax is recognised for undistributed earnings in subsidiaries, when A.P. Moller - Maersk controls the timing of dividends. No taxable dividends are currently expected. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that it can be utilised within a foreseeable future.\n\n## Uncertain tax positions\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk is engaged in a number of disputes with tax authorities of varying scope. Appropriate provisions and recognition of uncertain tax positions have been made where the probability of the tax position being upheld in individual cases is considered less than 50%. Claims for which the probability of A.P. Moller - Maersk's tax position being upheld is assessed by management to be at least 50%, are not provided for. Such risks are instead evaluated on a portfolio basis by geographical area and country risk. Provisions and uncertain tax liabilities are recognised when the aggregated probability of the tax position being upheld is considered less than 50%.",

Moller - Maersk has a share option plan for members of the Executive Board and other key employees. Each share option granted is a call option to buy an existing B share of nominal DKK 1,000 in A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\nThe share options are granted at an exercise price corresponding to 110% of the average of the market price on the first five trading days following the release of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' most recent Annual Report. Exercise of the share options is contingent upon the option holder still being employed at the time of vesting, which takes place when three years have passed from the date of grant. The share options can then be exercised when at least three years and no more than six years (seven years for share options granted to employees not members of the Executive Board) have passed from the date of grant. Special conditions apply regarding illness, death, and resignation as well as changes in the company's capital structure, etc.\n\nThe share options can only be settled in shares. A part of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S' holding of treasury B shares will be used to meet the company's obligations in respect of the share option plan.\n\nThe recognised remuneration expense related to the share option plan is USD 11m (USD 8m).\n\nThe average remaining contractual life for the outstanding stock options as per 31 December 2022 is 4.6 years (4.8 years), and the range of exercise prices for the outstanding stock options as per 31 December 2022 is DKK 7,605 to DKK 25,096 (DKK 7,605 to DKK 13,754).",

Moller - Maersk as part of A.P. Moller - Maersk's longterm incentive programme are recognised as remuneration expense over the vesting period as per the estimated fair value at the grant date and result in a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, A.P. Moller - Maersk revises its estimated number of awards that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions and service conditions. Any impact of the revision is recognised in the income statement with a corresponding adjustment to equity.\n\n## Note 5.3  Commitments\n\n## The future charter and operating lease payments are:\n\n| Lease commitments   | Ocean   | Logistics   & Services   | Terminals   | Towage   & Maritime  Services   | Total   |\n|---------------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| 2022                |         |                          |             |                                 |         |\n| Within one year     | 53      | 41                       | 12          | 2                               | 108     |\n| Total               | 53      | 41                       | 12          | 2                               | 108     |\n| 2021                |         |                          |             |                                 |         |\n| Within one year     | 101     | 4                        | 13          | 4                               | 122     |\n| Total               | 101     | 4                        | 13          | 4                               | 122     |\n\n| Capital commitments                                                    | Ocean   | Logistics   & Services   | Terminals   | Towage   & Maritime  Services   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| 2022                                                                   |         |                          |             |                                 |         |\n| Capital commitments relating to the  acquisition of non-current assets | 3,036   | 140                      | 414         | 505                             | 4,095   |\n| Commitments towards concession  grantors                               | -       | -                        | 930         | -                               | 930     |\n| Total capital commitments                                              | 3,036   | 140                      | 1,344       | 505                             | 5,025   |\n| 2021                                                                   |         |                          |             |                                 |         |\n| Capital commitments relating to the  acquisition of non-current assets | 1,753   | 89                       | 183         | 87                              | 2,112   |\n| Commitments towards concession  grantors                               | 208     | -                        | 963         | -                               | 1,171   |\n| Total capital commitments                                              | 1,961   | 89                       | 1,146       | 87                              | 3,283   |\n\n## Short-term and low-value leases\n\nAs part of the Group's activities, customary agreements are entered into regarding charter and operating leases of ships, containers, port facilities, etc.\n\nThe increase in capital commitments is primarily related to new vessel contracts entered into during 2022.

Maersk Line and APM Terminals have entered into agreements with terminals and port authorities, etc.,\n\ncontaining volume commitments, including an extra payment in case minimum volumes are not met.\n\nThe Group is involved in several legal cases, tax and other disputes. Some of these involve significant amounts and are subject to considerable uncertainty. Management continuously assesses the risks associated with the cases and disputes, and their likely outcome. It is the opinion of management that, apart from items recognised in the financial statements, the outcome of these cases and disputes are not probable or cannot be reliably estimated in terms of amount or timing. The Group does not expect these to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nTax may crystallise on repatriation of dividends. Through participation in a joint taxation scheme with A.P. M\u00f8ller Holding A/S, the Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for taxes payable, etc., in Denmark.\n\nAs part of the divestment of M\u00e6rsk Olie & Gas A/S (MOGAS) to Total S.A. in 2018, A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S has assumed a secondary liability related to the decommissioning of the offshore facilities in Denmark by issuance of a declaration. A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S assesses the risk of economic outflows because of this secondary liability as very remote.\n\n## Note 5.5  Cash flow specifications\n\n|                                                                    | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Change in working capital                                          |        |        |\n| Trade receivables                                                  | -1,018 | -1,909 |\n| Other working capital movements                                    | -731   | 346    |\n| Exchange rate adjustment of working capital                        | -59    | -47    |\n| Total                                                              | -1,808 | -1,610 |\n| Purchase of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment    |        |        |\n| Additions 1                                                        | -8,205 | -8,240 |\n| Of which right-of-use assets                                       | 4,210  | 4,722  |\n| Of which borrowing costs capitalised on assets                     | 49     | 5      |\n| Change in payables to suppliers regarding purchase of assets, etc. | -217   | 537    |\n| Total                                                              | -4,163 | -2,976 |\n\n- 1  Additions to intangible assets of USD 349m (USD 224m), property, plant and equipment of USD 3.6bn (USD 3.3bn), right-of-use assets of USD 4.2bn (USD 4.7bn) and assets held for sale of USD 5m (USD 10m).\n\n## Significant accounting judgements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operations in countries with limited access to repatriating surplus cash\n\nA.P.

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for listed companies.\n\nThe accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for 2022, except for the changes to accounting standards that were effective from 1 January 2022 and were endorsed by the EU. These changes have not had a material impact on the financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies are furthermore consistent with the accounting policies for the Group's financial statements with the following exceptions:\n\n- \u00b7 Shares in subsidiaries and associated companies are measured at cost or a lower recoverable amount\n- \u00b7 Dividends from subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised as income at the time of declaration unless considered a return of capital in subsidiary\n- \u00b7 No segment information is disclosed\n- \u00b7 Value of granted share options, restricted shares, and performance shares to employees in subsidiaries is expensed directly in the relevant subsidiary. At the time of the grant, the subsidiary settles the amount with A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S and the counter posting is made in equity. At the time of exercising, the proceeds are included in the company's equity.\n\n## New financial reporting requirements\n\nA.P. Moller - Maersk A/S has not yet adopted the following accounting standards and requirements:\n\nIFRS 17 - Insurance contracts: An analysis of the impact has been made and it has been assessed that the standard will not have a significant impact on recognition and measurement of the Group.\n\nOther changes to IFRS are not expected to have any significant impact on recognition and measurement.\n\n## Note 1.2 Significant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of the parent company financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements on an ongoing basis, and to form assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Management forms its estimates and judgements based on historical experience, independent advice, external data points, as well as on in-house specialists and on other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nEstimates that are material to the company's financial reporting are made on the determination of impairment of financial non-current assets, including subsidiaries and associated companies. Reference is made to notes 3.1 and 4.3.\n\nManagement assesses impairment indicators for invest ments in subsidiaries and associated companies and in general determines the recoverable amounts consistent with the assumptions described in note 3.2 of the consolidated financial statements.",

M\u00f8ller og Hustru Chastine Mc-Kinney M\u00f8llers Familiefond holds 9.30% of the share capital of the company.\n\nNote 4.1 in the consolidated financial statements includes all additional share capital disclosures including the development in the number of shares and in the holding of treasury shares.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe dividend of DKK 2,500 per share of DKK 1,000 was paid on 18 March 2022 - a total of DKK 46.3bn equivalent to USD 6.9bn, excluding treasury shares (dividend of DKK 330 per share of DKK 1,000 paid - total of DKK 6.4bn, equivalent to USD 1.0bn). The Board of Directors proposes a dividend to the shareholders of DKK 4,300 per share of DKK 1,000 (DKK 2,000 in ordinary dividend and DKK 2,300 in extraordinary dividend per share of DKK 1,000) - a total of around DKK 75.2bn, equivalent to around USD 10.9bn (2021: DKK 2,500 per share of DKK 1,000 - total of DKK 46.3bn equivalent to USD 6.9bn). Payment of dividends is expected to take place on 31 March 2023. Payment of dividends to shareholders does not trigger taxes to A.P. Moller - Maersk. As of 8 February 2023, there are sufficient free reserves in the Parent company to cover the proposed dividend following extraordinary dividends received from subsidiaries after the balance sheet date.\n\n## Note 4.2  Borrowings and net debt reconciliation\n\n|                                      | Net debt   as at   31 December   | Cash flow   | Other changes                 | Other changes   | Net debt   as at   31 December   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                      | 2021                             |             | Foreign   exchange  movements | Other 1         | 2022                             |\n| Bank and other credit institutions   | 1,137                            | -362        |                               |                 | 775                              |\n| Issued bonds                         | 3,341                            | -           | -177                          | -188            | 2,976                            |\n| Subsidiaries, etc., net              | 7,889                            | 25,628      | -63                           | 2,606           | 36,060                           |\n| Total borrowings, net                | 12,367                           | 25,266 2    | -240                          | 2,418           | 39,811                           |\n| Derivatives hedge of borrowings, net | 154                              | -           | 178                           | 200             | 532                              |\n| Borrowings classification:           |                                  |             |                               |                 |                                  |\n| Classified as non-current            | 4,165                            |             |                               |                 | 3,635                            |\n| Classified as current                | 13,052                           |             |                               |                 | 40,808                           |\n\n- 1  Non-cash dividends, capital increases, fair value adjustments, etc.\n- 2  Total cash flow from borrowings amounts to USD 25bn (USD 13bn), cash overdrafts to USD 264m (USD 262m) and cash flow from related hedges to USD 0m (USD 0m).\n\n|                                      | Net debt   as at   31 December   | Cash flow   | Other changes                 | Other changes   | Net debt   as at   31 December   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                      | 2020                             |             | Foreign   exchange  movements | Other 1         | 2021                             |\n| Bank and other credit institutions   | 2,401                            | -1,264      |                               |                 | 1,137                            |\n| Issued bonds                         | 3,824                            | -298        | -95                           | -90             | 3,341                            |\n| Subsidiaries, etc., net              | -8,075                           | 15,095      | 77                            | 792             | 7,889                            |\n| Total borrowings, net                | -1,846                           | 13,529 2    | -18                           | 702             | 12,367                           |\n| Derivatives hedge of borrowings, net | -36                              | 4           | 95                            | 91              | 154                              |\n| Borrowings classification:           |                                  |             |                               |                 |                                  |\n| Classified as non-current            | 5,644                            |             |                               |                 | 4,165                            |\n| Classified as current                | 9,676                            |             |                               |                 | 13,052                           |",

The company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nRisk management is carried out by a central finance department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the company's entities.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the company's profit or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The sensitivity analyses in the currency risk and interest rate risk sections relate to the position of financial instruments at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses for currency risk and interest rate risk have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from hedge designations in place at 31 December 2022. Furthermore, it is assumed that the exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have a symmetric impact, i.e. an increase in rates results in the same absolute movement as a decrease in rates.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses show the effect on profit and equity of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates and interest rates.",

The company uses various financial derivatives, including forwards, option contracts and cross-currency swaps, to hedge these risks. The key aspects of the currency hedging policy are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Net cash flows in other significant currencies than USD are hedged using a layered model with a 12-months horizon\n- \u00b7 Significant capital commitments or divestments in other currencies than USD are hedged\n- \u00b7 Most non-USD debt is hedged, however, depending on the asset-liability match and the currency of the generated cash flow.\n\n|                  |   Profit before tax |   Profit before tax |   Equity before tax |   Equity before tax |\n|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                  |                2022 |                2021 |                2022 |                2021 |\n| DKK              |                -233 |                 -65 |                -233 |                 -65 |\n| EUR              |                  91 |                 -15 |                  91 |                 -15 |\n| Other currencies |                  18 |                 -25 |                  18 |                 -25 |\n| Total            |                -124 |                -105 |                -124 |                -105 |\n\nThe company enters into derivatives to hedge currency exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\nAn increase in the USD exchange rate of 10% against all other significant currencies to which the company is exposed is presented in the table.",

The company strives to maintain a combination of fixed and floating interest rates on its net debt, reflecting expectations and risks.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is governed by a range of gross debt paying fixed interest. The level at 31 December is 43% (42%) excluding IFRS 16 leases.\n\nA general increase in interest rates by one percentage point is estimated, all thing else being equal, to affect profit before tax and equity, excluding tax effect, negatively by approx. USD 163m and negatively by approx. USD 185m, respectively (positively by approx. USD 91m and positively by approx. USD 48m, respectively).\n\nThis analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.\n\nThe hedging of the interest rate risk is done by cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. The hedging is a mix of fair value hedging, combined fair value hedging and cash flow hedging.\n\nThe hedges are expected to be highly effective due to the nature of the economic relationship between the exposure and the hedge. The source of ineffectiveness is the credit risk of the hedging instruments. For hedges where the cost of hedging is applied, the change in basis spread is recognised in other comprehensive income and is a time effect during the lifetime of the swap and at maturity amounts to 0. If the hedged transaction is prepaid, the change in basis spread will be recognised in profit or loss as ineffectiveness. The cost of hedging reserve amounts to a gain of USD 15m (USD 6m).\n\n| Borrowings and interest-bearing debt  to subsidiaries by interest rate levels   | Carrying   amount   | Next interest rate fixing   | Next interest rate fixing   | Next interest rate fixing   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| inclusive of interest rate swaps                                                |                     | 0-1 year                    | 2-4 years                   | 5- years                    |\n| 2022                                                                            |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| 0-3%                                                                            | 2,790               | 2,264                       | -                           | 526                         |\n| 3-6%                                                                            | 39,932              | 39,033                      | 659                         | 240                         |\n| 6%-                                                                             | 1,721               | 1,721                       | -                           | -                           |\n| Total                                                                           | 44,443              | 43,018                      | 659                         | 766                         |\n| Of which:                                                                       |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing fixed interest                                                          | 1,637               |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing floating interest                                                       | 42,806              |                             |                             |                             |\n| 2021                                                                            |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| 0-3%                                                                            | 15,668              | 15,071                      | -170                        | 767                         |\n| 3-6%                                                                            | 1,549               | 8                           | 1,166                       | 375                         |\n| Total                                                                           | 17,217              | 15,079                      | 996                         | 1,142                       |\n| Of which:                                                                       |                     |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing fixed interest                                                          | 2,138               |                             |                             |                             |\n| Bearing floating interest                                                       | 15,079              |                             |                             |                             |",

To minimise the credit risk, financial vetting is undertaken for all major customers and financial institutions, adequate security is required for commercial counterparties, and credit limits are set for financial institutions and key commercial counterparties.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nFinancial assets at amortised cost comprise loan receivables, lease receivables, and other receivables. These are all considered to have low credit risk and thus the impairment provision calculated based on 12 months of expected losses is considered immaterial. The financial assets are considered to be low risk when they have low risk of default, and the issuer has a strong capacity to meet its contractual cash flow obligations in the near term.\n\nOther financial assets at amortised cost include loans to subsidiaries. As of 31 December 2022, the loans amount to USD 4.6bn (USD 4.9bn) and are considered to have a low credit risk, thus the impairment provision to be recognised during the period is limited to 12 months of expected losses. The credit risk has not increased significantly since the initial recognition and is considered low based on the investment grade credit rating for the Group and consequently the financial strength of the major subsidiaries within the Group.\n\n## Financial institutions\n\nDeposits and bank balances are primarily held in relationship banks with a credit rating of at least A-. No individual exposure is above 10%. A.P. Moller - Maersk has ISDA agreements for trading of derivatives, under which the Group has a right to net settlement in the event of certain credit events. This results in the credit risk being limited to the net position per counterparty.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIt is of great importance for the company to maintain a financial reserve to cover the company's obligations and investment opportunities and to provide the capital necessary to offset changes in the company's liquidity due to changes in the cash flow from operating activities.\n\nThe flexibility of the financial reserve is subject to on going prioritisation and optimisation, among other things by focusing on the release of capital and following up on the development in working capital.\n\n| Net interest-bearing debt and liquidity              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Borrowings                                           | 44,443 | 17,217 |\n| Net interest-bearing debt                            | 13,691 | -2,621 |\n| Cash and bank balances                               | 8,082  | 10,154 |\n| Term deposits not included in cash and cash balances | 17,615 | 5,025  |\n| Securities                                           | 942    | -

 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n\nLevel 2 -  Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices)\n\nLevel 3 -  Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\nFair value of listed shares falls within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Non-listed shares and other securities fall within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of derivatives falls mainly within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of observable market data as of the end of the reporting period.\n\nFair value of level 3 assets and liabilities is primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A reasonably possible change in the discount rate is not estimated to affect the company's profit or equity significantly.\n\n## Financial instruments carried at amortised cost\n\nFair value of the short-term financial assets and other financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is not materially different from the carrying amount. In general, fair value is determined primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows. Where a market price was available, however, this was deemed to be the fair value.\n\nFair value of listed issued bonds is within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair value of the remaining borrowing items is within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and is calculated on the basis of discounted interests and instalments.",

M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S.\n\n## Report on the audit of the financial statements\n\n## Our opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements (pages 79 to 136) give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position at 31 December 2022 and of the results of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our Auditor's Long-form Report to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.\n\n## What we have audited\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and Parent Company Financial Statements of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2022 comprise income statement and statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement, statement of changes in equity and notes, including summary of significant accounting policies for the Group as well as for the Parent Company. Collectively referred to as the 'Financial Statements'.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA\n\nCode) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled\n\nour other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in\n\nArticle 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe were first appointed auditors of A.P. M\u00f8ller - M\u00e6rsk A/S on 12 April 2012 for the financial year 2012. We have been reelected annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 11 years including the financial year 2022. We were re appointed following a tendering procedure at the General Meeting on 15 March 2022.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most sig nificance in our audit of the Financial Statements for 2022. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\n## Key audit matter\n\nRecognition of revenue is complex due to the volume of transactions and the variety of different revenue streams within the segments.\n\nWe focused on this area due to the significance of amounts involved and because recognition of revenue involves accounting policy decisions, and judgements made by Management originating from different customer behavior, market conditions, terms and nature of services in the various segments.\n\nFurther, the volume of transactions and extent of different revenue streams involves internal controls, various IT applications and Management's monitoring hereof, to ensure correct revenue recognition, which are complex and introduce an inherent risk to the revenue recognition process. Reference is made to note 2.1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOur audit procedures included considering the appropriateness of the revenue recognition accounting policies and assessing compliance with applicable accounting standards.\n\nWe tested relevant IT applications and IT dependen cies supporting revenue recognition as well as relevant internal controls and Management's monitoring hereof. For the relevant internal controls, we updated our under standing and assessed whether they were designed and implemented to effectively address the risk of errors in the revenue recognised in the Financial Statements.\n\nWe applied data analytics on selected revenue streams in order to identify and test transactions outside the ordinary transaction flow and performed substantive procedures over invoicing and relevant contracts in order to assess the accounting treatment and principles applied, and tested journal entries on revenue. Further, we tested timing to ensure that the revenue is recognised in the correct financial year. Finally, we assessed the adequacy of disclosures provided by Management in the Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## Statement on the Management review\n\nManagement is responsible for Management Review (pages 5 to 77 and 142).\n\nOur opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Management Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read Management Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nMoreover, we considered whether Management Review includes the disclosures required by the Danish Financial Statements Act.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, in our view, Management Review is in accordance with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Parent Company Financial Statements and has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement in Management Review.\n\n## Management's responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.\n\n## Report on compliance with the ESEF Regulation\n\nAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the annual report of A.P.

The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing whether the annual report is prepared in XHTML format;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining an understanding of the company's iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements including notes;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the company's use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and\n- \u00b7 Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements including notes.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual report of A.P.
