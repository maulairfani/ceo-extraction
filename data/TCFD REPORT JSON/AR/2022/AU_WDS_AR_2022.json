        "page_content": "## About Woodside\n\n## We are a global energy company, founded in Australia with a spirit of innovation and determination.\n\nThe world needs energy that is a/ffordable, reliable and lower carbon to support a successful energy transition. We provide energy to heat and cool homes, keep lights on and support industry.\n\nWe aim to thrive through the global energy transition with a low cost, lower carbon, profitable, resilient and diversified portfolio. 1\n\nThe merger with BHP's petroleum business has increased the scale and diversification of our global portfolio, which includes oil and gas assets and interests in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, Senegal and Timor-Leste. We also have a focused exploration program.\n\nOur focus in operations remains on safety, reliability, e/fficiency and environmental performance, leveraging more than 35 years of operating experience.\n\nWe have growth opportunities across gas, oil and new energy.\n\nWoodside has several projects currently in execution phase. The Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 projects in Australia achieved a positive final investment decision (FID) in November 2021 and are targeting first LNG cargo in 2026. In Senegal, the Sangomar Field Development Phase 1 is targeting first oil in late 2023. In the US Gulf of Mexico, Shenzi North, a brownfield expansion of the Shenzi oil project, is targeting first oil in 2024 and Mad Dog Phase 2, a development of the southern flank of the Mad Dog field, is targeting start up in 2023. Woodside completed front-end engineering design (FEED) for the Trion oil project in 2022 and is aiming to be FID-ready in 2023.\n\nOur marketing, trading and shipping activities enable us to supply a diverse range of customers from our recently expanded global portfolio.\n\nOur climate strategy has two key elements: reducing our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions; and investing in the products and services to help our customers secure their energy needs and reduce their emissions. We have targets to reduce our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2025 and 30% by 2030, towards our aspiration to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner. 2,3\n\nWe also have a target to invest $5 billion in new energy products and lower carbon services by 2030. 4\n\nOur new energy opportunities include the proposed hydrogen and ammonia projects H2Perth and H2TAS in Australia, and the proposed hydrogen projects H2OK in the US and Southern Green Hydrogen in New Zealand.\n\nWe take a disciplined and prudent approach to investment through our capital allocation framework, with the goal to manage financial risks and maintain a resilient financial position to allow us to optimise the value delivered from our portfolio of opportunities.\n\nIntegrity, accountability and transparency drive our environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspirations and guide decision making at all levels of our business.\n\nWe strive to operate responsibly across our business activities. Enduring and meaningful relationships with communities are fundamental to our social performance.\n\nWe recognise that our success is driven by our people and our culture. We value diversity and we strive to keep each other safe.\n\n- 1. For Woodside, a lower carbon portfolio is one from which the net equity scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, which includes the use of o/ffsets, are being reduced towards targets, and into which new energy products and lower carbon services are planned to be introduced as a complement to existing and new investments in oil and gas. Our Climate Policy sets out the principles that we believe will assist us achieve this aim.\n- 2.  Target is for net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, relative to a starting base representative of the gross annual average equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over 2016-2020 and may be adjusted (up or down) for potential equity changes in producing or sanctioned assets with an FID prior to 2021.\n- 3.  Net equity greenhouse gas emissions are equal to Woodside's equity share of gross greenhouse gas emissions reduced by the number of retired carbon credits.\n- 4.  Individual investment decisions are subject to Woodside's investment targets. Not guidance. Potentially includes both organic and inorganic investment.",

        "page_content": "## Chair's report\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to report that 2022 was an historic year for Woodside. We successfully completed the merger with BHP's petroleum business, delivered record profit and became an even more significant supplier of energy to a world that needs it.\n\nThe combination of sustained high oil and gas prices coupled with strong operational performance from our enlarged portfolio contributed to a record reported annual net profit after tax of $6,498 million. We are well positioned for major capital investment through 2023 and 2024 and to return value to shareholders. The Board has determined a fully-franked final dividend of 144 US cents per share, resulting in a total full-year dividend of 253 US cents per share.\n\nOur merger with BHP's petroleum business was completed in June 2022, after gaining the approval of 98.7% of the shareholders who voted on the transaction. The merger was a momentous point in Woodside's history. It brought together the best of both organisations to create the largest energy company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and we subsequently commenced trading with secondary listings on the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. As a global independent energy company, we have the scale, diversity and resilience to provide value to shareholders and thrive through the energy transition.\n\nThe past year was marked by turmoil in global energy markets, with the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine highlighting the importance of energy security and a/ffordability as the world transitions to a lower carbon energy mix. An orderly energy transition requires solutions that balance these three elements.\n\nForecasts indicate that the energy transition is unlikely to be smooth and linear. An enormous amount of investment is required in the coming decades to meet growing global demand, particularly in developing economies with populations who are aspiring for an improved quality of life and access to reliable energy. The global energy transition could take a range of di/fferent pathways, and many pathways modelled include strong demand for natural gas. In order to embed new forms of energy into the mix, the world will need to build almost entirely new supply chains, whilst striving to maintain uninterrupted supply.\n\nWoodside's strategy in response to this challenge is unchanged. We are focused on delivering reliable, a/ffordable and lower carbon energy today and into the future.\n\nWe intend to do this from our low cost, resilient, diversified and profitable portfolio that enables us to adapt to the choices our customers make as they also navigate the energy transition.\n\nWe will continue to work cooperatively with governments and regulators as we deliver this energy, noting the importance of stable policy settings to encourage investment in new supply and reduce market volatility during this transition.\n\nDelivering energy safely remains Woodside's top priority. Our personal safety outcomes in 2022 failed to improve against the disappointing result in 2021. It is imperative we improve this in 2023.\n\nWe maintained high operational and process safety performance both in Australia and globally as we integrated new assets and personnel following the merger.\n\nGood progress has also been made on our key growth projects in 2022. Our Scarborough project in Australia is on track for first LNG cargo in 2026 and the Sangomar development o/ffshore Senegal is expected to deliver first oil late 2023.\n\nThe completion of the merger also brought an expanded development opportunity portfolio across oil, gas and new energy. We have never had so many opportunities competing for capital, and we are focused on high grading those opportunities that will deliver the most value in accordance with our capital allocation framework.\n\nOpportunities in the oil portfolio that we are looking to unlock include Trion, one of Mexico's first deepwater developments, and infill and tieback opportunities to Atlantis, Shenzi and Mad Dog in the US Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn gas, our opportunities include Calypso in Trinidad and Tobago, Browse o/ff the west coast of Australia, and Greater Sunrise in the Timor Sea between Australia and Timor-Leste.\n\nWoodside is also progressing opportunities in new energy products, such as hydrogen and ammonia, and technologies our customers need as they reduce their own emissions. We are leveraging nearly four decades of experience as a safe and reliable producer as we pursue these new energy opportunities.",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive O/fficer's report\n\nThe past year has been truly transformative for Woodside. The merged company has delivered record profit driven by our larger, geographically diverse portfolio of highquality assets, and made significant progress on our growth projects.\n\nIn 2022 Woodside reported net profit after tax of $6,498 million, driven by higher oil and gas prices and strong operational performance from our global assets. Operating cash flow increased by 132% to $8,811 million, strengthening Woodside's ability to fund our growth projects over the coming years and supporting returns to shareholders.\n\nWe completed the merger with BHP's petroleum business in June 2022, increasing Woodside's scale, diversity and financial resilience and positioning us to implement our strategy to thrive through the energy transition.\n\nWoodside's subsequent secondary listings on the London and New York stock exchanges provided a greater global presence and improved access to deep capital markets.\n\nWoodside has implemented initiatives to deliver greater than US$400 million annual synergies ahead of target. 1\n\nThe global energy security and a/ffordability crises that unfolded in 2022 resulted in unprecedented market volatility and shone a spotlight on the challenge we all face as we strive to maintain and improve global standards of living while reducing our emissions. But what we can be confident of is that global energy demand will continue to grow as the more than one billion people who don't currently have access to reliable and a/ffordable energy pursue aspirations for the same quality of life that we enjoy.\n\nThat demand, and the role gas can play as a lower carbon source of the energy the world needs, underpins our confidence in the strategy we have set out and are pursuing. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is making a significant contribution to both global energy security and decarbonisation. LNG is an important enabler for increased renewables build-out, providing the baseload and firming capacity required to address the intermittency of solar and wind power.\n\nThe world's demand for oil is also forecast to remain strong for the next two decades in applications such as power generation, transportation, manufacturing and other hard-to-abate sectors. Post-merger, Woodside's increased exposure to oil, which now contributes approximately 30% of our production, is expected to generate significant cash flow that will help fund our investments in both conventional and new energy.\n\nDelivering energy safely remains Woodside's top priority and in 2022 we disappointingly recognised a total recordable injury rate\n\n(TRIR) higher than target. Improving the safety performance of our workforce will be a key focus area in 2023.\n\nWe continued to achieve high reliability across Woodside's operated assets in 2022.\n\nWhen a supply crunch hit the eastern Australian energy market in mid-year due to coal-fired power outages and a drop o/ff in renewables, Woodside played its part by delivering as many molecules of its Bass Strait gas as possible to customers who needed it.\n\nIn Western Australia, the successful start-up of the PlutoKarratha Gas Plant (KGP) Interconnector pipeline enabled the accelerated production of 9.4 MMboe of Pluto gas using emerging spare capacity at KGP.\n\nOur international portfolio across the US Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean now includes interests in Shenzi, Atlantis, Mad Dog, Angostura and Ruby. These low cost producing assets have significant expansion potential in close proximity to infrastructure and attractive markets.\n\nWe are investing in projects that will deliver production and revenue for decades to come, providing a bright future for Woodside.\n\nAt the Sangomar field in Senegal, the subsea installation campaign got underway and development drilling progressed, with seven of the planned 23 wells now complete. Work to complete and commission Sangomar's floating production storage and o/ffloading facility is currently underway in Singapore ahead of targeted first oil towards the end of 2023.\n\nOur Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 projects combined were 25% complete at year-end and remain on track for targeted first LNG cargo in 2026. In 2022, fabrication of the floating production unit topsides commenced, subsea trees were delivered, pipeline manufacturing commenced, and we also completed the first stage of the Pluto Train 2 construction accommodation village in Karratha.\n\nMeanwhile, Woodside's pipeline of unsanctioned conventional energy developments continued to be matured. These include the Trion field o/ffshore Mexico, where we have completed front-end engineering design activities, issued tender packages for competitive bids and are working on regulatory approval submissions. We are aiming to be ready for a final investment decision on Trion in 2023.",

At Sunrise in the Timor Sea, the joint venture has agreed to undertake concept select studies while negotiations continue between the governments of Timor-Leste and Australia and the project proponents to agree a new production sharing contract. At Calypso in the Caribbean, we are focused on identifying the development concept and required commercial alignment.\n\nWoodside is managing our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and investing in the products and services our customers need to decarbonise.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved an 11% reduction in net equity Scope 1 and 2 emissions against our 2016-2020 starting base. 2 Our heritage Woodside-operated assets developed decarbonisation plans to identify and implement opportunities to reduce emissions, and similar plans are expected to be developed this year for the heritage BHP operated assets. 3\n\nWe have made progress on our hydrogen and ammonia opportunities. At our most advanced, H2OK in Oklahoma in the United States, we are aiming to be ready for a final investment decision in 2023.\n\nWe are investing in projects that will deliver production and revenue for decades to come, providing a bright future for Woodside.\n\nOur record profit in 2022 also means we are delivering strong returns through our payments to governments in Australia. Our total Australian tax and royalty payments of A$2.7 billion in 2022 demonstrates that when Woodside and our industry performs well, our contribution to government revenue is significant.\n\nI am proud to reflect on an incredible year for Woodside, in which our people achieved outstanding results while adapting to significant change.\n\nWoodside's roots remain in Australia, but in 2022 we have become a truly global business. I look forward in 2023 to the new Woodside continuing to deliver what we have promised for our shareholders, employees, partners and communities as we execute our strategy to thrive through the energy transition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Meg O'Neill\n\nChief Executive O/fficer and Managing Director 27 February 2023\n\nWoodside is developing a suite of carbon initiatives that could be used as services to customers or to reduce and o/ffset our own emissions. In 2022 we were awarded multiple o/ffshore greenhouse gas assessment permits for future carbon capture and storage opportunities. We also developed multiple relationships to collaborate on technologies which convert carbon to useful products.\n\n- 1. Pre-tax 100% basis. Excluding transition and separation costs.

The value of the final dividend payment is $2,734 million which represents approximately 80% of underlying NPAT for the second half of 2022, reflecting Woodside's strong operational performance and the contribution of BHP's petroleum business following completion of the merger on 1 June 2022. 1\n\nThe dividend reinvestment plan (DRP) has been suspended.\n\n## Liquidity and debt service\n\nDuring the year, Woodside generated $8,811 million of cash flow from operating activities and delivered positive free cash flow of $6,546 million. 2,3\n\nWoodside increased its standby debt facilities from $3,100 million to $4,050 million and repaid $283 million of maturing debt. At the end of the period, drawn debt was $5,138 million and liquidity was $10,239 million.\n\nWoodside's primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, net cash provided by operating activities, unused\n\nborrowing capacity under its bilateral facilities and syndicated facilities, issuances of debt or equity securities, and other sources, such as sales of non-strategic assets. Details of Woodside's credit facilities, including total commitments, maturity and interest, and amount outstanding at 31 December 2022, can be found in section 5 - Financial Statements.\n\nWoodside's principal ongoing uses of cash are to meet working capital requirements, fund debt obligations and to finance Woodside's capital expenditure and acquisitions. In our opinion, working capital is su/fficient for our present requirements.\n\nWoodside's capital expenditure for 2023 is expected to be between $6,000 million and $6,500 million primarily due to Sangomar and Scarborough project expenditure. This excludes the impact of any subsequent asset sell-downs or other changes in equity. We expect the execution of Sangomar and Scarborough to continue safely, targeting first oil in late 2023 and first LNG cargo in 2026 respectively.\n\nWoodside has no o/ff-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material e/ffect on the Woodside's financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n\n- 2.  Free cash flow is a non-IFRS measure. Refer to section 6.7 - Alternative performance measures for a reconciliation of these measures to Woodside's Financial Statements.",

Woodside's credit ratings of BBB+ and Baa1 were both rea/ffirmed in 2022 by S&P Global and Moody's respectively. 1\n\nWoodside's gearing at the end of 2022 was 1.6%, below our target range of 10% to 20%. Had the 2022 final dividend been paid on 31 December 2022, our gearing would increase to 9.0%. A low level of net debt positions Woodside's balance sheet for its expected future capital expenditure. As a result, Woodside's gearing may at times fall outside the target range of 10% to 20% as the balance sheet is managed through the investment cycle. 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nWoodside hedges to protect the balance sheet against downside commodity price risk, particularly during periods of high capital expenditure.\n\nWoodside hedged approximately 17 MMboe of 2022 volumes. The realised value of these oil price hedges was a pre-tax expense of approximately $475 million.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, Woodside has placed oil price hedges for approximately 22 MMboe of 2023 production at an average price of $75 per barrel.\n\nWoodside has also placed hedges for Corpus Christi LNG volumes to protect against downside pricing risk. These hedges are Henry Hub and Title Transfer Facility (TTF) commodity swaps. Approximately 49% of Corpus Christi volumes included in stock in transit for 2022, approximately 82% of 2023 volumes and approximately 29% of 2024 volumes have reduced pricing risk as a result of hedging activities.",

        "page_content": "## Energy markets\n\nThe world is grappling with a global energy crisis as surging energy prices impact economic conditions and disrupt customers' expectations for reliable and a/ffordable energy. Heightened geopolitical tension, rerouting of energy flows and an uncertain energy transition are contributing to a period of volatile energy prices.\n\n## Macroeconomic\n\nThe global economic rebound from the COVID-19 induced lows of 2020 is facing a weakened outlook as central banks in advanced economies tighten monetary conditions in response to elevated inflation levels. A broad-based global economic slowdown is widely expected to continue through 2023. The International Monetary Fund estimates in its World Economic Outlook report released in January 2023 that global gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow from 3.4% in 2022 to 2.9% in 2023. 1\n\n## Oil\n\nOil markets oscillated through 2022 as the rebound in post COVID-19 demand and sanctioned Russian supply put upward pressure on prices, whilst weakening global macroeconomic conditions and China's ongoing management of COVID-19 weighed against demand. The Dated Brent price averaged $101/bbl in 2022, a 43% increase from 2021. 2 Geopolitical tensions have highlighted the importance of energy security and further investment in low cost, lower emission developments to meet medium-term global demand.\n\n## Liquefied natural gas\n\nGlobal gas markets remain tight, as available LNG capacity is unable to meet immediate demand requirements from the unprecedented supply shock of reduced Russian supplies to Europe. In 2022, North Asian LNG prices averaged $34/MMBtu, more than doubling from 2021. 2\n\nWoodside expects natural gas to play a critical role in the energy transition across a range of sectors. Currently, less than half of global natural gas supply is used in power generation. On a lifecycle basis, natural gas emits approximately half the carbon dioxide of coal to generate power. It also has the potential to provide grid stability where needed, and may contribute to improved local air quality.\n\nAccording to Wood Mackenzie, global LNG demand is expected to grow by more than 60% in volume between 2021 and 2040. 3 This growth is driven across Asian and European nations, phasing out Russian natural gas supply. Woodside expects more LNG projects will be required to ensure adequate supply from the late-2020s, requiring a su/fficient price to bring new liquefaction capacity to the market.\n\n- 1. Source: World Economic Outlook update (January 2023) - Inflation Peaking amid Low Growth.\n- 2.  Source: S&P Global\n- 3.  Source: Wood Mackenzie\n\nWoodside's competitive cost of supply, experienced operatorship, balance sheet strength, and geographical proximity to major buyers makes us well placed to meet customers' demand for reliable and secure LNG supply.\n\n## New energy products\n\nAction to address climate change continues to strengthen against the backdrop of ensuring reliable, secure and a/ffordable energy. Targets to accelerate a hydrogen economy are building, for example the European Commission's REPowerEU plan and the pivotal United States' Inflation Reduction Act incentivises the production of lower carbon intensity energy. While the pace in growth of new energy products demand is uncertain, Woodside expects these to become a larger part of the future energy mix.\n\n## Australian domestic gas market\n\nSupply and price challenges experienced during 2022 highlighted the central role of gas in Australia's energy mix and reinforced the importance of stable policy settings to support new investment in gas supply and infrastructure.\n\nIn mid-2022, the east coast Australian gas market experienced a price spike which was driven primarily by the market being unable to respond to a sharp increase in gas demand caused by a colder than average winter, intermittent renewables generation and increased unreliability of coal generation. This price spike led to the Australian Government passing legislation imposing a 12 month price cap of A$12 per gigajoule in 2023 on new contract sales of gas sold by east coast and Northern Territory gas producers to customers and their a/ffiliates to wholesale customers in Australia.\n\nThe Western Australian gas market, with di/fferent infrastructure constraints, demand profiles and regulatory frameworks has not experienced the same supply and pricing issues. However, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) has forecast a small supply deficit for several years from 2023, until Woodside's Scarborough project is brought online.\n\nAs Australia rapidly reduces its reliance on coal for power generation and develops large-scale renewable generation and transmission infrastructure, Woodside expects gas to play a critical role in ensuring reliable and a/ffordable energy. With further supply challenges forecast in coming years, any longerterm solution to current pricing issues will require investment in new gas infrastructure and supply.",

        "page_content": "## Australian operations\n\nWoodside's Australian portfolio consists of operated and non-operated oil and gas projects across Australia. On completion of the merger with BHP's petroleum business, Woodside doubled its interest in the North West Shelf Project and acquired interests in Bass Strait, Pyrenees and Macedon. Woodside's share of production from Australian operations was 136.6 MMboe in 2022, a 50% increase compared to 2021. 1\n\n## Pluto LNG\n\nPluto LNG is a gas processing facility in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, comprising an o/ffshore platform and one onshore LNG processing train.\n\nWoodside's share of Pluto production was 52.4 MMboe in 2022, an 18% increase compared to 2021. This increase was driven by sustained high reliability of 98.3% for 2022, the start up of the Pluto-KGP Interconnector ahead of schedule and the commencement of operations on the first phase of the Pyxis Hub.\n\nProcessing of Pluto gas at KGP commenced in March 2022, resulting in the production of 13 additional LNG cargoes in 2022.\n\nThe Pyxis and Pluto North subsea tiebacks achieved steady state operations in January 2022, followed by the successful completion of the Xena-2 tieback in November 2022.\n\nWe continued to undertake safe and reliable operations at Pluto LNG with no Tier 1 or 2 process safety events in 2022, and strong safety performance while completing a high level of maintenance work.\n\nWoodside is pursuing the opportunity to reduce Scope 1 emissions at Pluto LNG by utilising solar energy from the proposed Woodside Solar project.\n\nWoodside celebrated in May 2022, the tenth anniversary of the first LNG produced at Pluto and in November 2022, the delivery of the asset's 700th LNG cargo. In December 2022, Pluto achieved the milestone of 50 million tonnes of LNG produced since start up in 2012.\n\nIn 2023, a major turnaround is planned for Pluto LNG.\n\nWoodside is operator and holds a 90% participating interest.\n\n## North West Shelf Project\n\nThe NWS Project consists of three o/ffshore platforms and the onshore Karratha Gas Plant (KGP) which includes five onshore LNG processing trains. It produces LNG, condensate, pipeline gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).\n\nWoodside's share of NWS Project production was 36.7 MMboe in 2022, a 49% increase compared to 2021. This was driven by the increase of Woodside's equity share from 16.67% to 33.33% following completion of the merger. In 2022, NWS also sustained high LNG reliability of 98.5% and successfully completed a major turnaround on KGP LNG Train 3 in May 2022.\n\nThe Greater Western Flank Phase 3 and Lambert Deep infill projects started up ahead of schedule and under budget. The successful delivery of the projects contributed to KGP continuing to operate at near full production rates in 2022.\n\nIn September 2022, the NWS Project celebrated the delivery of the 6,000th LNG cargo from KGP.\n\nThe NWS Project commenced tolling operations in March 2022 with the processing of gas delivered from Pluto through the Pluto-KGP Interconnector. During the year, 9.4 MMboe of production was delivered through the Interconnector. This is the first example of KGP processing third-party gas by utilising spare capacity.\n\nWoodside and NWS Project participants signed non-binding agreements with Western Gas for processing 2-3 Mtpa of Equus gas from 2027, initially through KGP and then later through Pluto LNG. Discussions continue with other resource owners for processing of additional third-party gas.\n\nThe NWS Project remains on track to accept Waitsia gas for processing at KGP in the second half of 2023.\n\nState and Commonwealth regulatory approval processes continue for the North West Shelf Project Extension, which supports long-term operations and processing of future third-party gas resources at KGP.\n\nWoodside is operator and holds a 33.33% participating interest.",

It processes gas from several o/ffshore gas fields including Julimar and Brunello.\n\nWoodside's share of Wheatstone production was 12.2 MMboe in 2022, a decrease from 13.5 MMboe in 2021 primarily due to the major facility turnaround in 2022.\n\nThe Julimar-Brunello Phase 2 project, which included the tieback of the Julimar field to the Wheatstone platform, achieved steadystate operations in Q1 2022.\n\nWheatstone safely completed the second phase of the multiyear, major turnaround in May 2022. High-rate production trials commenced in September 2022 to assess the feasibility of increased domestic gas production capacity. Trials are expected to conclude in Q2 2023.\n\nWoodside completed concept select for Julimar-Brunello Phase 3 and is maturing the project. The third phase of the Julimar-Brunello project will involve the tieback of additional production wells to the Wheatstone platform.\n\nIn 2023, Woodside is targeting FID readiness for Julimar-Brunello Phase 3.\n\nWoodside is operator and holds a 65% participating interest in the Julimar-Brunello fields. Woodside holds a 13% non-operated interest in the Wheatstone project.\n\n## Bass Strait\n\nThe Bass Strait is located in the south-east of Australia and produces oil and gas through a network of o/ffshore platforms, pipelines and onshore processing facilities.\n\nThe Bass Strait assets include the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV) and Kipper Unit Joint Venture (KUJV), which were added to Woodside's portfolio on 1 June 2022.\n\nWoodside's share of production from the Bass Strait was 19.6 MMboe in 2022, driven by strong plant reliability and gas demand.\n\nThe Bass Strait remains an important source of gas supply to the Australian east coast. The GBJV continues to invest in gas supply for the domestic market including taking a FID to develop additional gas from the Gippsland Basin Kipper field in March 2022.\n\nThe GBJV is progressing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions reduction opportunities which include executing long-term carbon dioxide supply contracts and progressing early frontend engineering design (pre-FEED) studies to determine the potential for carbon capture and storage in the Gippsland Basin.\n\nThe focus in 2023 is progressing execution of the Kipper Compression project, facility optimisation with reducing production rates and ongoing o/ffshore decommissioning obligations.\n\nWoodside holds a 50% non-operating interest in the GBJV and a 32.5% non-operating interest in the KUJV.\n\n## Other oil and gas assets\n\nWoodside operates three floating production storage and o/ffloading (FPSO) facilities o/ff the north-west coast of Western Australia. These are the Okha FPSO (Woodside interest: 50%), Ngujima-Yin FPSO (Woodside interest: 60%) and Pyrenees FPSO (Woodside interest: 40% in WA-43-L and 71.4% in WA-42-L).\n\nMacedon (Woodside interest: 71.4%), also operated by Woodside, is a gas project located near Onslow, Western Australia which produces pipeline gas for the Western Australian domestic gas market.\n\nThe Pyrenees FPSO and Macedon were added to Woodside's portfolio on 1 June 2022.\n\nWoodside's share of production from the FPSO assets was 10.6 MMboe, up from 8.6 MMboe in 2021.\n\nWoodside's share of production from Macedon was 5.1 MMboe since 1 June 2022. The Macedon facility delivered approximately 18% of the Western Australian domestic gas market supply in 2022.\n\nPermanent plugging and abandonment of four wells in the Balnaves field was successfully completed in November 2022. The well decommissioning activity was undertaken in preparation for the removal of remaining subsea infrastructure.\n\nBumi Armada's application to the High Court for special leave to appeal a judgement of the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in respect to its claim against Woodside following termination of FPSO services in 2016 was dismissed in November 2022.\n\nIn 2023, a major dry-dock turnaround is planned on the NgujimaYin FPSO.",

It has two key elements: reducing our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and investing in the products and services that our customers need as they secure their energy needs and reduce their emissions.\n\nOur Climate Report 2022 includes a detailed description of Woodside's approach to climate change. Woodside considers that the Climate Report contains disclosures consistent with the four recommendations and 11 recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), noting its Guidance for all Sectors and Guidance for NonFinancial Groups. We set out our TCFD-aligned disclosures in this separate report to enable us to provide information for interested stakeholders in a readily accessible way, alongside Woodside's climate-related plans, activities progress and data. This Annual Report should therefore be read in conjunction with Woodside's Climate Report 2022.\n\nWoodside has targets to reduce our net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 15% by 2025 and 30% by 2030, towards our aspiration to achieve net zero by 2050 or sooner. 2,3 In 2022, Woodside's net equity Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions totalled 4,615 kt CO 2 -e in 2022, which was 11% below the starting base. To achieve this, 754 kt CO 2 -e of carbon credits were retired.\n\nWoodside plans to achieve these targets by avoiding greenhouse gas emissions through the way we design our assets; reducing greenhouse gas emissions through the way we operate our assets; and originating and acquiring carbon credits to use as o/ffsets for the remainder.\n\nHow we operate our facilities has a direct impact on our progress towards our emission reduction targets. In 2022, asset decarbonisation plans were developed for the heritage Woodside assets, with the intention to extend these to the heritage BHP operated assets. 4 These plans identify opportunities to reduce emissions, such as energy e/fficiency projects, equipment modifications and lower carbon power.\n\nIn 2022, Woodside signed the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions\n\nInitiative, becoming the first Australasian company to do so. The signatories to the Initiative state that they believe virtually all methane emissions from the industry can and should be avoided.\n\nWoodside has a target to invest $5 billion in new energy products and lower carbon services by 2030, as part of our Scope 3 emissions plan. 5 At the end of 2022, Woodside has spent more than $100 million towards its $5 billion target. This spend includes electrolysers and liquefaction equipment for the proposed H2OK hydrogen project, the Heliogen pilot project, as well as the investment in String Bio.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe apply an ESG mindset to guide decision making at all levels of the business. Our activities and reporting continue to evolve in response to the increasing focus on sustainability priorities.\n\nWe conduct a broad-based materiality assessment process each year to inform our understanding of which sustainability topics are relevant to our business activities and stakeholders. This includes consideration of potential risks, opportunities and impacts.\n\nWoodside is an active member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights Initiative. It is underpinned by risk assessments, training, management of arrangements with private security providers and where applicable arrangements with public security.\n\nWoodside has been a member of Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) since 2005 and became an EITI Supporting Company in 2008. We are also an active member in Senegal, Timor-Leste and Trinidad and Tobago multistakeholder groups.\n\nOur Sustainable Development Report 2022 outlines our comprehensive approach to ESG performance and sustainability and features our 2022 ESG topics.

The objective of our risk management framework is to provide a single consolidated view of risks across the company to understand our full risk exposure and prioritise risk management and governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our risk management process, refer to our Risk Management Policy, which can be found on our website at woodside.com\n\nWoodside's risk management process is presented as a set of iterative steps that we undertake in a coordinated manner. The process helps us implement risk management to e/ffectively identify, assess, and control risks, thereby enhancing the likelihood of achieving our business objectives. The process involves:\n\n- \u00b7  communication and consultation with key stakeholders\n- \u00b7  define risk scope, context and criteria\n- \u00b7  risk assessment\n- \u00b7  risk treatment\n- \u00b7  monitor and review risk management process\n- \u00b7  record and report risks.\n\nThe process is defined in our risk management procedure which is designed to provide a consistent process for the recognition and management of risks that have the potential to materially impact the achievement of Woodside's business objectives.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee plays a crucial role in assisting the Board meet its oversight responsibility in relation to Woodside's risk management procedures. Refer to section 4.1.3 - Board committees for more information on the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nWe categorise risks into three categories:\n\nStrategic risks - Risks that could a/ffect our organisation's ability to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nEntity risks - Risks that could a/ffect our organisation's ability to achieve our business objectives. They can be positive, negative, or both and can address, create, or result in opportunities and threats.\n\nEmerging risks - Risks defined as an external threat or opportunity that has a high degree of uncertainty due to rapid or non-linear evolution. They have the potential to materially impact the achievement of strategic objectives.\n\nWoodside's risk appetite statement is a vital element of our risk framework. The statement communicates the type and amount of risk we are willing to take and accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives.

        "page_content": "## Overview of our strategic and material risk factors\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe global response to climate change is changing the way the world produces and consumes energy. The complex and pervasive nature of climate change means transition risks are interconnected with and may amplify other risks. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty of potential societal responses to climate change may create a systemic risk to the global economy. Climate change may also create significant physical risks, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, wildfires, floods and other climatic events, as well as chronic shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns.\n\n## How is this factor relevant to Woodside?\n\nWoodside's risks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy include possible impacts to demand (and pricing) for oil, gas and its substitutes, the policy and legal environment for its production, and Woodside's reputation and the operating environment. We may also face risks related to climate change's potential to cause physical damage or disruptions to our assets or our supply chains.\n\nWoodside is an energy company and in order for us to meet the needs of our current and future customers and the communities in which we operate, we must forecast and manage several critical risks to evolve and prosper through this transition.\n\nThese elements include:\n\n- \u00b7  the demand and pricing of oil and gas\n- \u00b7  the regulation of oil and gas production and consumption\n- \u00b7  the timing and rate of the global transition to a lower carbon economy\n- \u00b7  public perception of Woodside and the broader oil and gas industry\n- \u00b7  access to carbon credits or emission allowances\n- \u00b7  uncertainties associated with changing weather patterns.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  Physical impacts on our assets or those of our suppliers or customers caused by increased frequency or intensity of severe weather events.\n- \u00b7  Over or under investing in oil and gas reserves leading to an imbalance between our supply and global demand.\n- \u00b7  Failure to transition to new energy at a pace that serves the global demand.\n- \u00b7  Climate-driven changes to legislation or climate-related litigation resulting in additional costs and adversely impacting Woodside's reputation.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nWoodside is actively engaged in reducing our emissions and improving our energy e/fficiency, while providing opportunities for our customers and value chain participants to decarbonise, by supplying LNG and developing innovative lower carbon solutions and markets with a goal of growing a longer-term resilient portfolio.\n\n- \u00b7  Low availability and high cost of emission allowances or carbon credits impacting Woodside's ability to meet its 2025 and 2030 net emissions reduction targets. 1\n- \u00b7  Reputational risks with respect to Woodside or the oil and gas industry in general.\n- \u00b7  Financial risks, including limits on availability of funding or changes in financing terms for oil and gas projects.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\nWe have near and mid-term emissions reduction targets with plans to meet them. 1 We engage and advocate with key industry and governance stakeholders.

Our employees, host communities, Traditional Owners, government authorities, investors and other groups form significant relationships with our organisation. These relationships are built on the trust that Woodside will meet our stakeholders' expectations. We must also consider the role our commercial agreements play in relation to human rights around the world, we have a responsibility to ensure the rights of all humans aren't negatively a/ffected by our organisation.\n\nSome of the most significant risks to our relationships with stakeholders include:\n\n- \u00b7  engaging in activities that have real or perceived adverse impacts on the environment, biodiversity, human rights or cultural heritage\n- \u00b7  failing to meet our climate reduction targets or investment targets in new energy\n- \u00b7  inadequately responding to quickly evolving expectations of Woodside (including expectations that may significantly di/ffer in the various jurisdictions in which we operate).\n\nAdditionally, third-party risks that are outside of our control could negatively impact our reputation and licence to operate, such as oil spills or other disasters or scandals that cause collateral damage to Woodside's licence to operate via reputational damage to the oil and gas industry at large.\n\nFailure to maintain healthy relationships with our various stakeholders may result in violation of local or national laws or regulations, significant reputational damage, delayed approvals, civil suits and ultimately the deterioration of our licence to operate.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  Limited, delayed or failed approvals from local and national government bodies.\n- \u00b7  Lost or limited stakeholder support for our current business and future opportunities.\n- \u00b7  Risks related to class action lawsuits, litigation and activism, including allegations of greenwashing.\n- \u00b7  Reductions in the availability, or less favourable terms, of financing.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nWoodside proactively maintains and builds our social licence to operate through the application of our values, e/ffective stakeholder engagement strategies, our regulatory compliance framework and our anti-fraud and corruption program.\n\nOur regulatory compliance framework assists Woodside to proactively maintain relationships with governments and regulators within countries that support base business and future growth opportunities.\n\n- \u00b7  Decreased ability to attract and retain a talented workforce, and other operational concerns.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\nOur business conduct is informed by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), which set a global standard of conduct for all businesses wherever they operate. These principles exist over and above compliance with national laws and regulations protecting human rights.\n\nWoodside maintains meaningful relationships with stakeholders, seeking proactive engagement to inform decisions and gain support for changes.\n\nOur fraud and corruption framework aims to prevent, detect and respond to unethical behaviour. It incorporates policies, standards, guidelines and training, which will enable us to conduct our activities ethically and to a high standard.",

In order to maintain a stable pipeline of future projects and realise the full value of growth opportunities, Woodside will need to compete with major oil companies, national oil companies (NOCs), independent oil and gas companies, individual producers and new energy companies. Failure to e/ffectively compete with these companies may result in the inability to continue to expand Woodside's current operations and deliver shareholder value.\n\nWoodside must continue to e/ffectively manage relationships with industry partners, for example, at times we enter joint ventures with organisations which may also be a competing oil and gas supplier. It is essential that our voice is heard both within our industry and more broadly. In order for us to e/ffectively communicate, we may at times align with industry bodies to advocate what we believe is right.\n\nIn addition, our current and planned projects involve many unknown uncertainties and operating risks that could prevent us from realising profits or result in the total or partial loss of our investment. For example our Scarborough project is more than 12 months in to execution phase, however, we may face third-party opposition to environmental approvals, potentially impacting our project delivery schedule.\n\nNew energy: We have targeted to invest $5 billion in new energy products and lower carbon services by 2030. 1 However, there is uncertainty around the pace of required technological innovation and the reliability of technologies that will be needed to transition to a lower carbon environment. In addition, new sources of energy, such as hydrogen or ammonia, may be more di/fficult to commercialise than expected or may not be able to be commercialised safely or as e/fficiently as expected at scale. Woodside may also face unforeseen obstacles in the commercialisation of a future carbon capture business and in the implementation of other lower carbon services and emission reduction e/fforts.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  An unbalanced portfolio of traditional and new energy which may not meet the market's needs.\n- \u00b7  Limited or reduced market share resulting in a loss of shareholder value.\n- \u00b7  Our competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects, including operatorships and licences, than our financial or human resources permit.\n- \u00b7  Our projects could experience project implementation schedule slippage, permitting delays, shortages of or delays in the delivery of equipment or purpose-built components from suppliers, escalation in capital cost estimates, possible shortages of construction or other personnel, other labour shortages, environmental occurrences during construction that result in a failure to comply with environmental regulations or conditions on development, or delays and higherthan-expected costs due to the remote location of the projects, the impact of COVID-19 on the relevant workforce or supply chain, other unanticipated natural disasters, accidents, miscalculations, political or other opposition, litigation, acts of terrorism, operational di/fficulties, climate change related risks or other events associated with that construction that may result in the delay, suspension or termination of our projects.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nOur opportunity management framework is flexible and adaptable with the primary objective to realise the value of an opportunity while mitigating the risk of a suboptimal outcome.\n\nWe aim to identify and progress a suite of commercially attractive and sustainable opportunities that complement our existing assets, enable portfolio diversity and optimise our commercial position.\n\n- \u00b7  An inability to obtain financing at acceptable costs, or at all, for the development of new energy projects.\n- \u00b7  Failure to implement our new energy plans within our anticipated time frame, or at all.\n- \u00b7  Higher than expected competition in the markets for new energy products and lower carbon services in which Woodside expects to participate.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Operations\n\nDue to the nature of our operations, Woodside and our communities are potentially exposed to a broad range of risks. This is a result of factors such as the geographical range, operational diversity and technical complexity of our assets.\n\nHealth and safety: Our operations are subject to risks related to safety or major hazard events in connection with our activities or facilities, and may also include unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events which impact our ability to respond, manage and recover from such events.\n\nCommercial: We manage commercial risks within our operations, including third-party relationships such as joint venture partners, contract counterparties and our supply chain.\n\nRegulation: Woodside is subject to extensive governmental oversight and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and such regulations may change in ways that adversely a/ffect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are required to comply with securities regulations in Australia, the US and the UK.\n\nReserves and resources estimates: We manage the estimation of proved oil and gas reserves by using judgment and the application of complex rules, and subsequent downward adjustments of Woodside's reported reserves estimates are possible.\n\n## How is this factor relevant to Woodside?\n\nGeneral operational risks: Our operating assets are subject to a range of operating risks associated with process safety incidents, breaches of cybersecurity, extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions. Disruptions to our supply chain, or failure of our contractual counterparties to fulfill their obligations, could adversely impact our production, operations and our financial performance, result in litigation or class actions and cause long-term damage to our reputation.\n\nHealth and safety: At Woodside, one of our competitive advantages is our record of operating safely. Failure to continue to do so could result in sustained production interruptions leading to an inability to meet production forecasts, as well as potential reputational damage with customers, employees, commercial partners and other stakeholders.\n\nCommercial: The majority of our major projects and operations are conducted in joint ventures, which may limit our control over, and our ability to e/ffectively manage risks associated with, such projects. Joint venture participants may have economic or business interests or objectives that are inconsistent with or opposed to our interests and objectives. For projects in which we are not the operator, we may be unable to control the behaviour, performance and cost of operations of joint ventures in which we participate. In these cases, we will be dependent on joint venture participants acting as operators and their ability to direct operations or manage the timing and performance of any activity or the costs or risks involved may be reduced.\n\nRegulation: We are subject, in each of the countries in which we operate, to various national and local laws, regulations and approvals relating to the exploration, development, production, marketing, pricing, transportation and storage of our products, as well as the management, decommissioning, clean up and restoration of our properties, and management and disclosure of our operations and impacts. The exploration, production, and transportation of oil and gas involves risk that releases to the environment may occur, which could cause substantial harm to the environment, natural resources, or human health and safety.\n\nThese laws and regulations could change, and any such changes could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business and financial condition. Because such laws and regulations are subject to amendment and reinterpretation over time, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. Moreover, we cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate the oil and gas industries might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted and what e/ffect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that result in the imposition of more stringent standards for greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas industry could restrict the areas in which this sector may operate, and could result in increased compliance costs and changes in product pricing, which could impact consumer demand for our products.\n\nAdditionally, the conduct of Woodside, our employees and our third-party partners could result in actual or alleged breaches of laws, regulations and approvals, including fraud, corruption, anti-competitive behaviour, money laundering, breaching trade or financial sanctions, market manipulation, privacy breaches, ethical misconduct and wider organisational cultural failings. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with applicable laws, regulations and approvals.\n\nReserves and resources estimates: Estimating proved oil and gas reserves involves subjective judgements and determinations based on available geological, technical, contractual and economic information. New information from production or drilling activities, changes in economic factors, such as oil and gas prices, alterations in the regulatory policies of host governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or other events may cause estimates to change over time. Additionally, estimates may change to reflect acquisitions, divestments, new discoveries, extensions of existing fields and improved recovery techniques.",

We may also be required to maintain financial assurance through bonds or insurance.\n- \u00b7  A failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and approvals may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures, the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of current or proposed projects, and issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\n- \u00b7  Safe operation is fundamentally embedded through an extensive framework of controls that deliver strong operational performance in our base business. We have a track record of operating discipline and excellence.\n- \u00b7  The framework includes production processes, drilling and completions and well integrity management processes, inspection and maintenance procedures and performance standards. The framework is supported and inspected on an ongoing basis by our regulators.\n- \u00b7  The suspension, revocation, failure to renew or alteration of, or challenges to, the terms of the licences, permits, government contracts or approvals required for our operations.\n- \u00b7  Sanctions for non-compliance with laws and regulations may include administrative, civil and criminal penalties, demand for reimbursement for government or regulatory actions, government orders, suspension or revocation of licences, permits, government contracts or approvals, and corrective action orders.\n- \u00b7  Government policy objectives in the countries in which we do business, now or in the future, could take the form of increased governmental regulations (including in respect of restoration, protection of the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, natural resources, and worker health and safety), redirection of product distribution (such as domestic gas reservation policies), changes in taxation regulation or enforcement (including, for example, changes in tax rates or increased focus on audits), taxation subsidies or royalties, nationalisation of resource assets or restrictions or moratoriums on our operations on government leases, limitations on periods of lease retention, interference with the confidentiality and availability of information, forced renegotiation of contracts, changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies, trade sanctions, currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other governmental steps.\n- \u00b7  Actual or alleged violations of the securities laws that we are subject to could result in private or governmental litigation, civil penalties and regulatory action.\n- \u00b7  Downward adjustments of our reported reserves estimates could indicate lower future production volumes or the impairment of assets.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\n- \u00b7  Decommissioning is integrated into project planning. We work with our partners and technical experts to identify sustainable and beneficial post-closure options that minimise financial, social and environmental impacts.\n- \u00b7  The framework is adaptable to enable us to maintain and improve our operating model and performance, target reliability, cost discipline, emissions reductions and strong safety and environmental performance for both our existing business and future growth opportunities.",

Several factors can a/ffect our position, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Market and commodity price: Woodside's revenues are primarily derived from the sale of hydrocarbons. The prices Woodside receives for these products are variable and are impacted by global economic factors beyond Woodside's control. We seek to forecast changes in the economic factors to enable us to maintain a strong market position during challenging economic times. Refer to section 6.3 - Additional disclosures and section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n- \u00b7 Capital management: For Woodside to continue to operate sustainably we must make risk informed decisions related to allocation of capital. We seek to apply a disciplined and balanced approach to capital management through the commodity price cycle. Refer to section 2.2 - Strategy and capital management for further information.\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange risk: Woodside is exposed to foreign currency risk from future commitments, financial assets and financial liabilities that are not denominated in US dollars. Refer to section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk: This is the risk that Woodside's financial position will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. Woodside's risk relates primarily to financial instruments with floating interest rates including long-term debt obligations, cash and short-term deposits. Refer to section C in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n- \u00b7 Integration of BHP Petroleum: While Woodside continues to integrate BHP's petroleum business with its own, there is a risk that integration may take longer than expected or that integration may cost more than anticipated. If integration is not achieved in a timely and e/ffective manner, the full benefits of the combination of the two businesses, including the anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits that Woodside expects to achieve from the merger, may be delayed or achieved only in part or not at all. This could adversely impact the merged group's business, results of operations and financial condition and the prospects of the merged group. Woodside's financial results could also be adversely a/ffected by impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets, the application of future accounting policies or interpretations of existing accounting policies including by regulatory direction, and changes in estimates of decommissioning costs.\n\n## Examples of how this factor may impact Woodside\n\n- \u00b7  A reduced ability to fund our strategy including our projects.\n- \u00b7  An imbalance in supply and demand can impact commodity prices and our ability to forecast market conditions determines whether we are impacted positively or negatively.\n- \u00b7  Woodside may become a less attractive joint venture partner.\n- \u00b7  Reduced shareholder returns due to lower commodity prices.\n- \u00b7  If we inaccurately forecast the global demand for our LNG products we may face di/fficulties obtaining longer term sales contracts with desirable commercial terms.\n- \u00b7  If counterparties to our derivative instruments are unable to fulfill their obligations, a larger percentage of our future oil and gas production could be subject to price changes.\n- \u00b7  Inability to achieve anticipated synergies and cost savings on expected timeline or at all.\n\n## How is Woodside managing these risks?\n\nThe delivery of our strategic portfolio objectives requires significant capital expenditure, supported by strong underlying cashflows.\n\nUncertainty associated with product demand is mitigated by selling LNG in a portfolio manner and under long-term take or pay sale agreements, in addition to the spot market. Our low cost of production and prudent approach to balance sheet risk management further mitigates this exposure. Refer to section 6.3 - Additional disclosures and section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n\n- \u00b7  A flexible approach to capital management enables this overall level of investment in the di/fferent areas of our business and the mix to be adjusted to reflect the external environment. Our capital management strategy focuses on capital allocation, capital discipline and e/fficiency, and active balance sheet management including commodity and foreign exchange hedging.\n- \u00b7  We maintain insurance in line with industry practice and su/fficient to cover normal operational risks. However, Woodside is not insured against all potential risks because not all risks can be insured and\n- \u00b7  Unforeseen costs relating to the integration of development, extraction and production operational systems, IT systems and financial and accounting systems of both businesses.\n- \u00b7  Higher than anticipated costs and liabilities for P&A and decommissioning requirements for assets following the merger.\n- \u00b7  Impairments of assets, goodwill or other intangible assets could have a significant negative e/ffect on our reported net income and our ability to pay dividends in one or more accounting periods if the level of impairment were to exceed profits available for distribution.\n\nThese impacts may lead to a loss in shareholder value, loss of market share to competitors, delays or stoppages in our operations, reduced capacity to fund capital projects, delayed or suspended regulatory approvals, legal liabilities and adverse impacts on Woodside's reputation, social licence to operate and on the delivery of our strategy.\n\nbecause of constraints on the availability of commercial insurance in global markets. Insurance coverage is determined by the availability of commercial options and cost/benefit analysis, taking into account Woodside's risk management program. Losses that are not insured could impact Woodside's financial performance. For example, Woodside does not purchase insurance for the loss of revenue arising from an operational interruption. Our extensive framework of financial controls, including monitoring of counterparties, enables the management of these risks.\n\n- \u00b7  The US dollar reflects the majority of Woodside's underlying cashflows and is used in our financial reporting, reducing our exposure to currency fluctuations. Refer to section A in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information.\n- \u00b7  Refer to section C in the Notes to the Financial Statements for further information on interest rate risk management.\n- \u00b7  Woodside has commenced implementing controls and procedures to satisfy the requirements of Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) in 2023.",

An additional 14.9 MMboe of production was consumed primarily as fuel in operations in the year ended 31 December 2022 (FY2022) resulting in a total production of 171.7 MMboe for 2022. 1 At 31 December 2022, Woodside's remaining Proved (1P) Reserves are 2,385.2 MMboe. Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves remaining are 3,640.3 MMboe, while the Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources remaining are 8,661.9 MMboe (Table 1).\n\nWoodside is an Australian company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, and the London Stock Exchange. Woodside reports its Proved (1P) Reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. These guidelines are also compliant with 2018 Society of Petroleum Engineers/ World Petroleum Council/American Association of Petroleum Geologists/Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers Petroleum Resources Management System (SPE-PRMS). Woodside prepares and reports its Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves and Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines.\n\nThe acquisition of the Acquired Assets on 1 June 2022 resulted in net increases of 922.8 MMboe for 1P Reserves, 1,472.3 MMboe for 2P Reserves and 1,816.3 MMboe for 2C Contingent Resources. Woodside's decision to withdraw from its interest in Myanmar, announced on 27 January 2022, resulted in 2C Contingent Resources divestiture of 109.5 MMboe. These changes are further described in the Woodside Half-Year Report released 30 August 2022 (Half-Year Report).\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the following apply to this Reserves and Resources Statement: The e/ffective date for Reserves and\n\nResources estimates is 31 December 2022. Proved Reserves are calculated using SEC-compliant economic assumptions and pricing. Production is reported for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. Reserves, Resources and Production stated are Woodside's net share and inclusive of fuel consumed in operations.\n\nFY2022 changes included revisions of previous estimates and transfers of 41.8 MMboe for 1P Reserves, 48.0 MMboe for 2P Reserves, and 286.1 MMboe for 2C Contingent Resources. Key drivers for the revisions include:\n\n- \u00b7  completion of an Atlantis full-field integrated subsurface study that resulted in 46.3 MMboe and 13.2 MMboe increases in 1P Reserves and 2P Reserves respectively\n- \u00b7  inclusion of o/ffshore fuel gas reserves and favourable commodity prices resulting in a net increase of 51.7 MMboe to Proved Undeveloped Reserves and 44.5 MMboe 2P Undeveloped Reserves at Scarborough\n- \u00b7  inclusion of fuel gas reserves and incorporation of drilling results at Sangomar resulting in a Proved Undeveloped Reserves increase of 24.7 MMboe\n- \u00b7  alignment of Proved Reserves to the SEC reporting basis and conversion to products-based reporting (-160.7 MMboe) as described in Methodology below\n- \u00b7  improved overall field performance at Pluto, North West Shelf, and Julimar-Brunello led to 1P Reserves increases of 31.7 MMboe, 17.6 MMboe, and 25.7 MMboe, respectively. Inclusion of fuel gas volumes at Liard Basin, Canada resulted in a net increase of 285.4 MMboe 2C Contingent Resources.\n\nProved Undeveloped to Proved Developed reclassifications are further discussed in the Proved Undeveloped Reserves section of this Reserves and Resources Statement.\n\nTable 1: Woodside's Reserves 2,3,4,5 and Contingent Resources 6 overview (net Woodside share, as at 31 December 2022)\n\n|                                                    | Natural gas 7 Bcf 10   |   NGLs 8 MMbbl 11 | Oil &  condensate   MMbbl   | Total 9 MMboe 12   |   Fuel included  in total  MMboe |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Proved 13  Developed 14  and Undeveloped 15        | 10,783.6               |              26.3 | 467.0                       | 2,385.2            |                            251.6 |\n| Proved Developed                                   | 2,925.1                |              22.5 | 234.3                       | 770.0              |                             81.1 |\n| Proved Undeveloped                                 | 7,858.5                |               3.8 | 232.8                       | 1,615.2            |                            170.5 |\n| Proved plus Probable 16  Developed and Undeveloped | 16,425.9               |              48   | 710.6                       | 3,640.3            |                            358.2 |\n| Proved plus Probable Developed                     | 4,137.5                |              40   | 349.9                       | 1,115.8            |                            102.4 |\n| Proved plus Probable Undeveloped                   | 12,288.4               |               8   | 360.7                       | 2,524.5            |                            255.8 |\n| Contingent Resources                               | 41,589.1               |              88.8 | 1,276.7                     | 8,661.9            |                            497.7 |\n\nSmall di/fferences are due to rounding",

        "page_content": "## Methodology\n\nReserves and Contingent Resources estimates have not been adjusted for risk. Proved (1P) Reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis, excluding royalties owned by others, in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. As defined by the SEC, Proved (1P) Reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts, and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that renewal of existing operating contracts is reasonably certain, estimates of economically producible Reserves reflect only the period before the contracts expire. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence within a reasonable time.\n\nProved Reserves are estimated by reference to available well and reservoir information, including but not limited to well logs, well test data, core data, production and pressure data, geologic data, seismic data and, in some cases, similar data from analogous, producing reservoirs. A wide range of engineering and geoscience methods, including performance analysis, numerical simulation, well analogues and geologic studies, have been used to develop high confidence in estimated quantities. Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves and Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources are estimated in accordance with the SPEPRMS guidelines. SPE-PRMS guidelines allow (amongst other things) escalations to prices and costs and, as such, volumes estimates in accordance with those guidelines would be on a di/fferent basis than volumes estimated as prescribed by the SEC. Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves and Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources estimates are inherently more uncertain than Proved (1P) Reserves estimates.\n\nChanges in the estimates of Reserves and Contingent Resources from those reported by Woodside in the reserves statement in Woodside's 2021 Annual Report released in February 2022 include changes due to the matters noted below, including changes in the basis used to define the volumes reported and the inclusion of volumes added as a result of the merger with BHP Petroleum.\n\n## Specifically:\n\n- \u00b7  Prior to the Half-Year Report 2022, Woodside reported Proved Reserves based on the SPE-PRMS guidelines. Woodside now reports its Proved Reserves in accordance with SEC regulations. The use of SEC-compliant methods for estimating and reporting Proved Reserves in the reserves update in the Half-Year Report 2022 resulted in reductions in the estimates of Proved Reserves for some assets. SEC-compliant Proved Reserves estimates use a more restrictive rules-based approach and are generally lower than estimates prepared solely in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines due to certain di/fferences, including because the SEC-compliant Proved\n\n- Reserves use specified commodity price assumptions, exclude probabilistic aggregation, and use a narrower interpretation around unpenetrated sand bodies and fault blocks.\n- \u00b7  Woodside's Reserves and Contingent Resources are now reported inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Prior to the Half-Year Report 2022, Woodside's Reserves and Contingent Resources were reported net of the fuel consumed in operations up to the outlet of the floating production storage and o/ffloading facility (FPSO) or platform (for o/ffshore oil projects) or the inlet to the downstream (onshore) processing facility (for onshore gas projects).\n- \u00b7  To achieve consistency between Woodside's reporting of production and reserves volumes, Woodside now uses 'natural gas', 'natural gas liquids' and 'oil/condensate' volumes categories e/ffective 1 June 2022, which are defined based on products. Prior to the Half-Year Report 2022, Woodside used 'dry gas' and 'condensate' volumes categories, which were defined based on composition.\n- \u00b7  The barrel of oil equivalent (boe) conversion factor for natural gas remains unchanged at 5.7 Bcf per MMboe, the same conversion factor used previously for dry gas. The Acquired Assets are now reported on this basis. Historically, the BHP Petroleum business used a boe conversion factor of 6.0 Bcf per MMboe.\n\n## Governance and Assurance\n\nWoodside has several processes to provide assurance for Reserves and Contingent Resources reporting, including the Woodside Reserves Policy, the Woodside Petroleum Resources Management Procedure, the Woodside Petroleum Resource Management Guideline, sta/ff training, and minimum competency levels and external audits. Woodside policy requires external audits of all projects with material Reserves at least once every four years. The Reserves and Contingent Resources reported for the Acquired Assets were assured by Woodside in accordance with the processes previously applied by the BHP Petroleum business. Reserves and Contingent Resources assessments are reviewed to ensure technical quality and compliance with SEC and SPE-PRMS reporting requirements (as applicable). Unless otherwise stated, all petroleum reserves and resources estimates are quoted at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 pounds per square inch (psi) (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n\n## Qualified petroleum reserves and resources evaluator statement\n\nThe estimates of petroleum reserves and contingent resources are based on and fairly represent information and supporting documentation prepared by, or under the supervision of, Mr Ben Stephens, Woodside's Vice President Reserves and Subsurface, who is a full-time employee of the company and a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The reserves and resources statement as a whole has been approved by Mr Stephens. Mr Stephen's qualifications include a Bachelor of Engineering (Petroleum Engineering) from the University of New South Wales, Australia, and 19 years of relevant experience.",

This represents an increase in Proved Undeveloped Reserves of 429.0 MMboe from the 1,186.2 MMboe as at 31 December 2021. The largest element of this increase was a 529.7 MMboe increase as a result of the acquisition of the Acquired Assets. Adjustment to the SEC reporting basis and implementation of product reporting reduced Proved Undeveloped Reserves by 110.9 MMboe.\n\nDuring FY2022, a total of 54.0 MMboe Proved Undeveloped Reserves were converted to Proved Developed Reserves through development activities primarily in the following projects: Greater Western Flank Phase 3 and Lambert Deep\n\ndevelopments at North West Shelf in Australia (20.5 MMboe), infill well (XNA02) to support ongoing production from the Pluto LNG Project in Australia (15.8 MMboe), multiple development opportunities at Shenzi in the US Gulf of Mexico including installation and commissioning of subsea multiphase pumping and well completions (17.1 MMboe).\n\nDevelopment plan changes in Sangomar and Julimar-Brunello Phase 3 resulted in 24.7 MMboe and 4.1 MMboe increases to Proved Undeveloped Reserves. Favourable commodity prices resulted in an increase of 15.5 MMboe in Proved Undeveloped Reserves. Additionally, a net increase of 19.9 MMboe in Proved Undeveloped Reserves occurred due to positive revisions in Scarborough and Bass Strait partially o/ffset by negative revisions due to technical studies and performance at Pluto and JulimarBrunello and the reclassification of Julimar-Brunello Phase 4 to Contingent Resources.",

The incremental projects are included in the company business plan, demonstrating the intent to proceed with the developments. Material concentrations of Undeveloped Reserves in the US Gulf of Mexico are under active development and are converted to Developed Reserves as wells are drilled and completed. The Mad Dog Phase 2 development is expected to come online in 2023.\n\nThe changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves in FY2022 are summarised by category in Table 7.\n\nTable 7: Proved Undeveloped (PUD) Reserves Reconciliation (net Woodside share, as at 31 December 2022)\n\n|                                               | Total  MMboe   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Reserves as at 31 December 2021 32            | 1,186.2        |\n| Acquisitions and Divestments                  | 529.7          |\n| Revision of Previous Estimates                | -100.7         |\n| Adjustment to SEC and product reporting basis | -110.9         |\n| Reclassifications to Developed                | -54.0          |\n| Performance, Technical Studies, and Other     | 19.9           |\n| Development Plan Changes                      | 28.8           |\n| Price                                         | 15.5           |\n| Extensions and Discoveries                    | -              |\n| Reserves as at 31 December 2022 33            | 1,615.2        |\n\nSmall di/fferences are due to rounding\n\nDuring FY2022, Woodside spent $3.8 billion on development activities worldwide. Of this amount:\n\n- \u00b7  $3.5 billion was spent progressing the conversion of Proved Undeveloped Reserves for projects where development status was achieved in FY2022 or will be achieved when development is completed in the future\n- \u00b7  $0.3 billion represented other development expenditures, including compliance and infrastructure improvement.\n\n## Additional information for US investors\n\nThe SEC prohibits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, from disclosing estimates of oil or gas resources other than 'reserves' (as that term is defined by the SEC). In this report, Woodside includes estimates of quantities of oil and gas using certain terms, such as 'Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves,' 'Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources,' 'Reserves and Contingent Resources,' 'Proved plus Probable,' 'Developed and Undeveloped,' 'Probable Developed,' 'Probable Undeveloped,' 'Contingent Resources' or other descriptions of volumes of reserves, which terms include quantities of oil and gas that may not meet the SEC's definitions of proved, probable and possible reserves, and which the SEC's guidelines strictly\n\nprohibit Woodside from including in filings with the SEC. These estimates are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and would require substantial capital spending over a significant number of years to implement recovery, and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being recovered by Woodside. In addition, actual locations drilled and quantities that may be ultimately recovered from Woodside's properties may di/ffer substantially. Woodside has made no commitment to drill, and likely will not drill, all drilling locations that have been attributable to these quantities. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosures in Woodside's filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov.\n\n## Notes to the Reserves and Resources Statement\n\n- 1. 'Production' is the volume of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and oil produced during the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 and converted to 'MMboe' for the specific purpose of reserves reconciliation. The production volume figures in this Reserves and Resources Statement di/ffer from the production volume figures reported in Woodside's annual and quarterly reports, because the production volume figures reported in this Reserves and Resources Statement include all fuel consumed in operations but exclude 0.9 MMboe in excess of Reserves and Resources working interest percentage primarily from Pluto non-operating participants processed via the Pluto-KGP Interconnector.\n- 2.  For o/ffshore oil projects, the reference point is defined as the outlet of the floating production storage and o/ffloading facility (FPSO) or platform, while for the onshore gas projects the reference point is defined as the outlet of the downstream (onshore) gas processing facility.\n- 3.  'Reserves' are estimated quantities of petroleum that have been demonstrated to be producible from known accumulations in which the company has a material interest from a given date forward, at commercial rates, under presently anticipated production methods, operating conditions, prices, and costs. Woodside reports Reserves inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Proved (1P) Reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SEC regulations which are also compliant with SPE-PRMS guidelines. SEC-compliant Proved (1P) Reserves estimates use a more restrictive, rules-based approach and are generally lower than estimates prepared solely in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines due to, among other things, the requirement to use commodity prices based on the average of first of month prices during the 12-month period in the reporting company's fiscal year. Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and are not compliant with SEC regulations.\n- 4.  Assessment of the economic value in support of an SPE PRMS (2018) reserves and resources classification, uses Woodside Portfolio Economic Assumptions (Woodside PEAs). The Woodside PEAs are reviewed on an annual basis or more often if required. The review is based on historical data and forecast estimates for economic variables such as product prices and exchange rates. The Woodside PEAs are approved by the Woodside Board. Specific contractual arrangements for individual projects are also taken into account.\n- 5.  Woodside uses both deterministic and probabilistic methods for the estimation of Reserves and Contingent Resources at the field and project levels. All Proved (1P) Reserves estimates have been estimated using deterministic methodology and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations, and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X. Unless otherwise stated, all petroleum estimates reported at the company or region level are aggregated by arithmetic summation",

        "page_content": "- by category. The aggregated Proved (1P) Reserves may be a conservative estimate due to the portfolio e/ffects of arithmetic summation.\n- 6.  'Contingent Resources' are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied project(s) are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to one or more contingencies. Contingent Resources are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and may include, for example, projects for which there are currently no viable markets, or where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development, or where evaluation of the accumulation is insu/fficient to clearly assess commerciality. Woodside reports Contingent Resources inclusive of all fuel consumed in operations. Contingent Resources are di/fferent from, and should not be construed as, Reserves. Contingent Resources estimates may not always mature to Reserves and do not necessarily represent future Reserves bookings. Contingent Resources volumes are reported at the 'Best Estimate' (P50) confidence level. Best Estimate (2C) Contingent Resources are not compliant with SEC regulations. The SEC prohibits disclosure of oil and gas resources, including Contingent Resources, in SEC filings. However, Australian securities regulatory authorities allow disclosure of oil and gas resources, including Contingent Resources.\n- 7. 'Natural gas' is defined as the gas product associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas. Liquid volumes of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are reported separately.\n- 8.  'Natural gas liquids' or 'NGL' is defined as the product associated with liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and consists of propane, butane, and ethane - individually or as a mixture.\n- 9.  'Total' includes fuel consumed in operations.\n- 10. 'Bcf' means Billions (10 9 ) of cubic feet of gas at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n- 11.  'MMbbl' means millions (10 6 ) of barrels of NGL, oil and condensate at standard oilfield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsius).\n- 12.  'MMboe' means millions (10 6 ) of barrels of oil equivalent. Natural Gas volumes are converted to oil equivalent volumes via a constant conversion factor, which for Woodside is 5.7 Bcf of dry gas per 1 MMboe. Volumes of NGL, oil and condensate are converted from MMbbl to MMboe on a 1:1 ratio.\n- 13.  'Proved Reserves' are those quantities of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGLs that, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating contracts, and government regulations. Proved Reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest basis in accordance with the SEC regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10(a) of Regulation S-X.\n- 14.  'Developed Reserves' are those Reserves that are producible through currently existing completions and installed facilities for treatment, compression, transportation and delivery, using existing operating methods and standards.\n- 15.   'Undeveloped Reserves' are those Reserves for which wells and facilities have not been installed or executed but are expected to be recovered through significant future investments.\n- 16.  'Probable Reserves' are those Reserves which analysis of geological and engineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverable. Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves represent the best\n\n- estimate of recoverable quantities. Where probabilistic methods are used, there is at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves. Proved plus Probable (2P) Reserves are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines and are not compliant with SEC regulations.\n- 17.  Proved Reserves as at 31 December 2021 as estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines.\n- 18.  'Acquisitions and Divestments' are revisions that represent changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of Reserves or Contingent Resources, which result from either purchase or sale of interests and/or execution of contracts conveying entitlement, and, in this Reserves and Resources Statement, includes volumes added as a result of the merger with BHP Petroleum.\n- 19.  'Revision of Previous Estimates' are changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of Reserves or Contingent Resources, which, for the purposes of this Reserves and Resources Statement, includes changes to previous estimates of Proved Reserves which reflect the changes in the basis used to define the volumes reported as Proved Reserves as described in the introduction to this Reserves and Resources Statement, including adjustments (i) to convert Proved (1P) Reserves to SEC-compliant methods; (ii) to include all fuel consumed in operations; and (iii) to revise reporting categories to achieve consistency between Woodside's reporting of production and reserves volumes.\n- 20. 'Transfer to/from Reserves' are revisions that represent changes (either upward or downward) in previous estimates of Reserves or Contingent Resources, which are a result of re-classification of petroleum resources estimates (i.e. from Reserves to Contingent Resources or vice versa) associated with one or more project(s).\n- 21.  'Extensions and Discoveries' represent additions to Reserves or Contingent Resources that result from increased areal extensions of previously discovered fields demonstrated to exist subsequent to the original discovery and/or discovery of Reserves or Contingent Resources in new fields or new reservoirs in old fields.\n- 22. Proved Reserves at 31 December 2022 are estimated and reported in accordance with SEC regulations. Proved plus Probable Reserves and Contingent Resources at 31 December 2022 are estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines.\n- 23. 'Greater Pluto' consists of Pluto, Xena, Pyxis, Larsen, Martell, Martin, Noblige, and Remy fields.\n- 24. 'North West Shelf' (NWS) consists of all oil and gas fields within the North West Shelf Project Area.\n- 25. 'Exmouth' consists of Pyrenees, Macedon, Julimar-Brunello, and Ngujima-Yin fields.\n- 26. 'Scarborough' consists of Scarborough, Thebe, and Jupiter fields.\n- 27. 'GoM' consists of Shenzi, Shenzi North, Atlantis, and Mad Dog fields.\n- 28. 'International' consists of Angostura, Ruby, T&T Deep Water, Trion, and Sangomar fields which are under Production/Revenue Sharingtype agreements. These fields represent approximately 5% of 1P and 2P Reserves and 13% of 2C Contingent Resources. Woodside net economic interest volumes are reported.\n- 29. 'Browse' consists of Brecknock, Calliance, and Torosa fields.\n- 30. 'Sunrise' consists of Sunrise and Troubadour fields.\n- 31.  'Liard' comprises Unconventional Contingent Resources in the Liard Basin which require a sanctioned project for development.\n- 32. Proved Undeveloped Reserves as at 31 December 2021 as estimated and reported in accordance with SPE-PRMS guidelines.\n- 33.

Includes BHP Petroleum from 1 June 2022 to 31 December 2022.\n- 2.  International is primarily US.\n\nAs set out in this section, the number of wells drilled refers to the number of wells completed at any time during the respective year, regardless of when drilling was initiated. Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.\n\nAn exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir. A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.\n\nA productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well. Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation. A dry well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in su/fficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.\n\nDuring 2022, productive development wells included the XNA02 Xena well in Australia and wells at Shenzi and Atlantis in the US GoM. Dry exploratory wells included the Hoodoo test in Western GoM, Wildling, which was a potential Shenzi tie back, and the non-operated Starman test in the central GoM. In Senegal, Woodside drilled a productive exploratory well to appraise a nearfield tieback opportunity near to the under construction Sangomar FPSO facility.\n\n## Present development activities continuing as of 31 December 2022\n\nThe number of wells in the process of drilling and/or completion as of 31 December 2022 was as follows:\n\n|                 | Exploratory wells   | Exploratory wells   | Development wells   | Development wells   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n| /uni00A0        | Gross               | Net                 | Gross               | Net                 | Gross   | Net     |\n| Australia       | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -       | -       |\n| International 1 | -                   | -                   | 30                  | 13.0                | 30      | 13.0    |\n| Total           | -                   | -                   | 30                  | 13.0                | 30      | 13.0    |\n\nDevelopment wells in progress include Sangomar wells in Senegal, Mad Dog Phase 2 wells, Atlantis wells, Shenzi North wells and a Mad Dog A spar well in the US GoM. The Sangomar development is installing a waterflood recovery scheme as part of the ongoing project, and in the Gulf of Mexico a waterflood recovery scheme is included in the Mad Dog Phase 2 project.",

A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one.\n\nProductive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production. Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well. Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves.\n\nThe number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which Woodside held an interest at 31 December 2022 was as follows:\n\n| /uni00A0      | Crude oil wells   | Crude oil wells   | Natural gas wells   | Natural gas wells   | Total   | Total   |\n|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|---------|\n|               | Gross             | Net               | Gross               | Net                 | Gross   | Net     |\n| Australia     | 323               | 167.8             | 183                 | 94.1                | 506     | 262.0   |\n| International | 77                | 38.3              | 10                  | 4.7                 | 87      | 43.1    |\n| Total         | 400               | 206.2             | 193                 | 98.9                | 593     | 305.0   |\n\nOf the productive crude oil and natural gas wells, 140 (net: 66) wells had multiple completions. The number of wells with multiple completions refers to wells that have downhole equipment installed that allows zonal isolation or controlled commingling of production as permitted and approved by the applicable regulator.\n\nDeveloped and undeveloped acreage (including both leases and concessions) held at 31 December 2022 was as follows:\n\n| /uni00A0           | Developed acreage   | Developed acreage   | Undeveloped acreage   | Undeveloped acreage   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Thousands of acres | Gross               | Net                 | Gross                 | Net                   |\n| Australia          | 2,417               | 1,212               | 3,406                 | 3,116                 |\n| International 1,2  | 147                 | 74                  | 23,736                | 11,466                |\n| Total              | 2,564               | 1,286               | 27,142                | 14,582                |\n\nWoodside has initiated exits from our Myanmar, Republic of Korea, Peru, Ireland and o/ffshore Canada positions, totalling approximately 13,545 thousand acres gross (7,149 thousand acres net). Approximately 744 thousand acres gross (476 thousand acres net), 57 thousand acres gross (26 thousand acres net) and 963 thousand acres gross, (277 thousand acres net) of undeveloped acreage will expire in the years ending 31 December 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively if Woodside does not establish production or take any other action to extend the terms of the licenses and concessions.\n\n## Delivery commitments\n\nWoodside has contracts that require delivery of fixed volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas and NGL. Woodside intends to fulfill its short-term and long-term obligations with its production or from purposes of third-party volumes.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, delivery commitments were as follows:\n\n| /uni00A0                                | Natural gas (MMboe)   | Crude oil (MMbbl)   | Condensate (MMbbl)   | NGLs (MMbbl)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|\n| Year ending 31 December                 |                       |                     |                      |                |\n| 2023 to 2027                            | 362.6                 | 6.3                 | 1.1                  | 3.8            |\n| Thereafter                              | 232.6                 | -                   | -                    | -              |\n| Total oil and gas delivery  commitments | 595.2                 | 6.3                 | 1.1                  | 3.8            |",

The Board is responsible for the overall corporate governance of Woodside.\n\nWoodside's corporate governance model is illustrated in the diagram below. The Woodside Management System (WMS) describes the Woodside way of working, enabling Woodside to understand and manage its business to achieve its objectives. It defines the boundaries within which Woodside employees and contractors are expected to work. The WMS establishes a common approach to how we operate, wherever the location.\n\nWoodside continues to review and, where necessary, enhance our corporate governance policies and practices. We frequently consider developments arising in the markets where Woodside securities are listed, including the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), London Stock Exchange (LSE) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The ASXCGC Recommendations are not incorporated by reference to this Statement. As shown in this Statement, throughout the year, Woodside complied with all the ASXCGC Recommendations.

Woodside undertakes extensive background and screening checks prior to appointing Senior Executives. Details of Woodside's Senior Executives are set out in section 4.1.4 Executive Leadership Team.\n\nWoodside also undertakes extensive background and screening checks prior to nominating a director for election by shareholders, including checks as to character, experience, education, criminal record and bankruptcy history. Woodside provides to shareholders all material information in its possession concerning the director standing for election or re-election in the explanatory notes accompanying the notice of meeting.\n\nInduction training is provided to all new directors. It includes a comprehensive induction manual, discussions with the CEO and Senior Executives and the option to visit Woodside's principal operations either upon appointment or with the Board during its next site tour.\n\nQuestionnaires are completed annually to assess each director's skills and knowledge required to discharge their obligations\n\nto the company. Woodside considers at least annually the need for new and existing directors to undertake professional development to develop and maintain the skills and knowledge needed to perform their role as directors e/ffectively, and provides directors who require professional development the opportunity to develop and maintain the required skills and knowledge. Directors attend continuing professional education sessions, including industry seminars and approved education courses, which are paid for by the company, where appropriate.\n\n## Director remuneration\n\nDetails of remuneration paid to directors (executive and non-executive) are set out in the 2022 Remuneration Report in section 4.3 - Remuneration Report. The Remuneration Report also contains information on the company's policy for determining the nature and amount of remuneration for directors and Senior Executives and the relationship between the policy and company performance.\n\n## Board access to information and independent advice\n\nSubject to the Directors' Conflict of Interest Policy, directors have direct access to members of company management and to company information in the possession of management. Directors are entitled to obtain independent legal, accounting or other professional advice at the company's expense where a request for such advice is approved by the Chair. In the case of a request made by the Chair, approval is required by a majority of the non-executive directors.\n\n## Director attendance at meetings\n\n## Directors in o/ffice, committee membership

        "page_content": "## Board performance evaluation\n\nBoard performance evaluations are conducted annually.\n\nThe reports on Board and committee performance are provided to all directors and discussed by the Board. The report on the Chair's performance is provided to the Chair and two committee chairs for discussion.\n\nThe report on each individual director is provided to the individual and to the Chair. The Chair meets individually with each director to discuss the findings of their report.\n\nAs disclosed in the 2021 Corporate Governance Statement, in 2021 an external consultant was engaged to conduct a comprehensive review of the e/ffectiveness of the Board and Board committees. The evaluation followed the process outlined above and involved interviews with directors and senior management and observation of Board and committee meetings. The review also focused on the Board's composition and succession planning including diversity, skills and experience.\n\nThe review was finalised in 2022. It highlighted the directors' views on the top priorities for the Board.\n\nThe Board, through the Nominations & Governance Committee, considered and discussed the final report in detail.\n\nThe external review also informed the Board's review of succession priorities and upcoming appointments will be made with regard to the key opportunities identified.\n\nThe Human Resources & Compensation Committee reviews and makes recommendations to the Board on the criteria for the evaluation of the performance of the CEO. The Board conducts the evaluation of the performance of the CEO.\n\nReview of the 2022 performance of the CEO and executive succession planning was conducted by the Board.\n\n## Directors' retirement and re-election\n\nThe Woodside Constitution sets out the requirements for the retirement and re-election of directors. With the exception of the CEO/Managing Director, directors must retire at the third AGM following their election or most recent re-election. At least one director must stand for election at each AGM.\n\nBoard support for a director's re-election is not automatic and is subject to satisfactory director performance.\n\n## Director independence\n\nIn accordance with the Policy on Independence of Directors, the Board assesses independence with reference to whether a director is non-executive, not a member of management and is free of any business or other relationship that could materially interfere with, or could reasonably be perceived to materially interfere with, the independent exercise of their judgement.\n\nIn making this assessment, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances. In particular, the Board focuses on the factors relevant to assessing the independence of a director set out in Box 2.3 of the ASXCGC Recommendations.\n\nThe Board has reviewed the independence of each of the nonexecutive directors in o/ffice at the date of this Statement and determined that they are all independent. The CEO, Ms Meg O'Neill, is not considered independent as she is an Executive Director and a member of management.\n\nTwo of the non-executive directors have been employed by Woodside in the past. Dr Haynes was seconded to Woodside as General Manager of the North West Shelf Venture from 1999 to 2002. Dr Ryan was employed by Woodside as a member of the North West Shelf petroleum production team from 1993 to 1996. A significant period of time has elapsed since they ceased employment with Woodside and the Board is comfortable that they bring an independent judgement to bear on issues before the Board.\n\nDr Haynes was re-elected at the 2021 AGM and has served eleven years on the Board in June 2022. The Board reviewed the independence of Dr Haynes and determined that he remained independent, notwithstanding his length of tenure on the Board.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Board has approved a Directors' Conflict of Interest Policy which applies if there is, or may be, a conflict between the personal interests of a director, or the duties a director owes to another company, and the duties the director owes to Woodside. Directors are required to disclose circumstances that may a/ffect, or be perceived to a/ffect, their ability to exercise independent judgement so that the Board can assess independence on a regular basis.\n\nUnder Woodside's Constitution, directors must comply with the Corporations Act in relation to disclosure and voting on matters involving material personal interests. Subject to the Corporations Act:\n\n- \u00b7  a director may be counted in a quorum at a Board meeting that considers, and may vote on, any matter in which that director has an interest\n- \u00b7  the company may proceed with any transaction that relates to the interest and the director may participate in the execution of any relevant document by or on behalf of the company\n- \u00b7  the director may retain benefits under the transaction even though the director has an interest\n- \u00b7  the company cannot avoid the transaction merely because of the existence of the interest.\n\nUnder Woodside's Constitution, a director may be a director of or hold any other o/ffice or position in any corporation promoted by the company or in which the company may be interested. The Board may exercise the voting power conferred by the shares in any corporation held or owned by the company, and a director may vote in favour of exercising those voting rights despite the fact that the director is, or may be about to be appointed, a director of that other corporation and may be interested in the exercise of those voting rights. An interested director is to be counted in a quorum despite the interest.",

The Board is also responsible for satisfying itself that management has developed and implemented a sound system of risk management and internal control.\n\nThe Board has delegated oversight of the Risk Management Policy, including review (at least annually) of the e/ffectiveness of Woodside's internal control system and risk management framework, to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Audit & Risk Committee also regularly reviews Woodside's Risk Appetite Statement and oversees Internal Audit's activities and reviews Internal Audit's performance.\n\nManagement is responsible for promoting and applying the Risk Management Policy.\n\nIn 2022, the Audit & Risk Committee reviewed and confirmed the company's risk management framework was sound, and that the company was operating with due regard to the risk appetite endorsed by the Board.\n\n## Internal Audit function\n\nInternal Audit provides independent assurance that the design and operation of the Group's risk management and internal control system is e/ffective. A risk-based audit approach is used to ensure that higher risk activities are prioritised in the audit program.\n\nInternal Audit is independent of both business management and of the activities it reviews and has all necessary access to management and information to fulfill its role. Internal Audit is sta/ffed by industry professionals including qualified accountants and engineers. The head of Internal Audit is jointly accountable to the Audit & Risk Committee and the Senior Vice President Corporate Services.\n\n## Governance, Risk and Compliance function\n\nThe Governance, Risk and Compliance Function is responsible for Woodside's risk management framework, development of risk management capability, and providing risk management oversight to senior levels of management and the Audit & Risk Committee on the strategic risk profile and the Group's risk management performance.\n\n## Material risks\n\nOur material risks (including environmental and social risks) and how they are managed are disclosed in section 3.8 - Risk factors.\n\n## External audit and reporting External Auditor independence\n\nIn accordance with Woodside's External Auditor Policy, the Audit & Risk Committee oversees the engagement of Woodside's external auditor, governed by the External Auditor Guidance Policy (guidance policy). Internal audit and external audit are separate and independent of each other.\n\nThe guidance policy includes provisions directed at maintaining the independence of the external auditor and assessing whether the proposed provision of any non-audit services by the external auditor is appropriate. The guidance policy classifies a range of non-audit services which could potentially be provided by the external auditor as acceptable within limits, requiring Audit & Risk Committee pre-approval or not acceptable. The Audit & Risk Committee reviews the auditor independence annually.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee did not waive the pre-approval requirement under paragraph (c)(7)(i) of Rule 2-01 of SEC Regulation S-X in 2022.\n\nWith e/ffect from 2022, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed as auditor of the Group, replacing Ernst & Young (EY). Under SEC regulations, the remuneration of the auditors (PwC) of $5.4 million (2021: $4.6 million (EY)) is required to be presented as follows: audit fees represent 76%  (2021: 38%); audit-related fees 18% (2021: 58%); tax fees 5% (2021: 3%); and all other fees 1% (2021: 1%).\n\n## Verification of periodic corporate reports\n\nA statement setting out the processes undertaken by Woodside to verify the integrity of the periodic corporate reports it releases to the market that are not audited by an external auditor is available in the Corporate Governance section of Woodside's website.\n\n## CEO and CFO assurance\n\nBefore approving the Financial Statements for a financial period, the Board receives from the CEO and CFO a declaration stating that:\n\n- \u00b7  in their opinion Woodside's financial records have been properly maintained, comply with the appropriate accounting standards and give a true and fair view of Woodside's financial position and performance\n- \u00b7  the opinion has been formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control which is operating e/ffectively.",

        "page_content": "## 4.1.8 Other governance disclosures\n\n## Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nWoodside's management, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, have evaluated, as required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), the e/ffectiveness of Woodside's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as at 31 December 2022. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that Woodside's disclosure controls and procedures were e/ffective, as at 31 December 2022, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by Woodside in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarised and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, including that such information is accumulated and communicated to Woodside's management, including the CEO and CFO, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n## Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nThis annual report does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of Woodside's registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\n\n## Attestation report of the registered public accounting firm\n\nNot applicable.\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThe Group's accounting records and financial reporting processes rely on the e/ffectiveness of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems used. Following the merger, the ERP system of BHP Petroleum was separated from BHP and exists independently of Woodside's ERP system. There are various risks associated with maintaining two independent ERP systems, including reliability and integrity of the systems and accuracy of financial information.\n\nThis change occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, and in Woodside's view it has materially a/ffected, or is reasonably likely to materially a/ffect, Woodside's internal control over financial reporting. To address this, Woodside performed the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7  reconciled opening balances for BHP Petroleum to ensure data migration from the BHP system was complete and accurate\n- \u00b7  implemented additional internal controls over the model to consolidate financial information from both ERP systems to ensure the data was complete and accurate\n- \u00b7  assessed the accounting policies of BHP Petroleum and the impact on the Group's financial position and results of operation\n- \u00b7  reformed additional governance procedures to incorporate and identify impacts of the BHP Petroleum business on the Group's financial records and disclosures.\n\n## Exemptions from the NYSE listing standards for audit committee\n\nAs required by NYSE listing standards, Woodside maintains an Audit & Risk Committee for the purpose of assisting the Board's oversight of its financial statements, its internal audit function and its independent auditors. Woodside's Audit & Risk Committee is in full compliance with Exchange Act Rule 10A-3 and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.\n\nWhile Woodside's Audit & Risk Committee is directly responsible for remuneration and oversight of the external auditor, ultimate responsibility for the appointment of the external auditor rests with Woodside shareholders, in accordance with Australian law and the Woodside Constitution. However, in accordance with the limited exemptions set forth in Rule 10A-3, the Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for the annual auditor engagement and if there is any proposal to change auditors, the committee does make recommendations to the Woodside Board on any change of auditor, which are then considered by Woodside shareholders at the annual meeting of Woodside shareholders.\n\n## Di/fferences from NYSE corporate governance requirements\n\nWoodside's ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and, accordingly, Woodside is subject to the listing rules of the NYSE (NYSE Listing Rules). The NYSE Listing Rules include certain accommodations in the corporate governance requirements that allow foreign private issuers, such as Woodside, to follow 'home country' corporate governance practices in lieu of the otherwise applicable corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Woodside has elected to comply with certain home country rules in lieu of the applicable NYSE requirements, as more fully described below.\n\nWoodside may in the future decide to use other foreign private issuer exemptions with respect to some of the other NYSE Listing Rules. Following Woodside's home country governance practices, as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a company listed on the NYSE, may provide less protection than is accorded to investors under the NYSE Listing Rules applicable to US domestic issuers. If, at any time, Woodside ceases to be a foreign private issuer, it will take all action necessary to comply with the SEC and NYSE Listing Rules.\n\n## Quorum\n\nThe NYSE Listing Rules generally require that a listed company's by-laws provide for a quorum for any meeting of the holders of such company's voting shares that is su/fficiently high to ensure a representative vote. Pursuant to the NYSE Listing Rules, Woodside, as a foreign private issuer, has elected to comply with practices that are permitted under Australian securities laws in lieu of the provisions of the NYSE Listing Rules. The Woodside Constitution provides that a quorum for a meeting of Woodside Shareholders is three eligible Woodside Shareholders entitled to vote.",

In addition, (i) the audit committee must have a written charter which is compliant with the requirements of Section 303A.07(b) of the NYSE Listing Rules, (ii) the listed company must have an internal audit function and (iii) the listed company must fulfill all other requirements of the NYSE Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3. Foreign private issuers must comply with the audit committee standard set forth in Rule 10A-3, subject to limited exemptions, but may elect to follow 'home country' practices in lieu of the additional audit committee requirements in the NYSE Listing Rules. Rule 10A-3 requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation,\n\nretention and oversight of the work of the external auditor unless the company's governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters.

More detail on the Committee's activities in 2022 is available in the Corporate Governance Statement 2022.\n\nthe Board is proud of the excellent results achieved by the Woodside team in 2022 through the merger process and in the combined business. these results are reflected in our 2022 Executive key management personnel (KMP) remuneration outcomes outlined below and in further detail in this report.\n\n## Business performance\n\nIn 2022, the Corporate Scorecard was based on five equally weighted measures chosen for their impact on short-term and long-term shareholder value. these measures are earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation excluding impairment (EBItDA excluding impairment), operating expenditure, production, material sustainability issues and delivery against business priorities.\n\nthe merged company delivered EBItDA excluding impairment significantly above target at US$11,234 million and Operating Expenditure in line with target at A$2,063 million. Production for 2022 was above the revised target at 157.7 MMboe. Process safety performance was on target with zero tier 1 loss of primary containment process safety events and one low risk tier 2 event. Personal safety has remained a priority during 2022 but disappointingly our total recordable injury rate of 1.80 was higher than our target of 1.0. Gross equity scope 1 and 2 emissions were higher than target primarily due to increased production. Gross equity emissions are calculated prior to retirement of carbon credits as o/ffsets, focusing the organisational priorities on avoiding and reducing emissions.\n\nGood progress has been made on key growth projects in 2022. Our Scarborough project in Australia is on track for first LNG cargo in 2026 and the Sangomar development o/ffshore Senegal is expected to deliver first oil late in 2023.\n\nthe company's performance across the five Corporate Scorecard measures gave an overall corporate performance outcome of 7 (out of a maximum of 10). the Board considered the significant achievements of our team in 2022 and exercised its discretion by raising the outcome to 8 for the purposes of the EIS. this outcome recognises the sustained e/fforts of the team to successfully complete the merger while delivering strong operational results and progressing our growth projects and new energy opportunities. Overall the CEO's award increased by approximately 5.6% as a result of this decision.\n\nthese results are reflected in our 2022 Executive KMP KPIs and outcomes for 2022 section of this report.",

        "page_content": "## Executive KMP changes\n\nIn 2022 the Committee approved changes to the leadership structure for the merged company, including appointment to roles reporting directly to the CEO, aiming to bring together the capabilities, experiences and diverse perspectives from both organisations to deliver long-term success for the merged company. Leadership positions are based in Perth and Houston, reflecting the geographic spread of the combined portfolio.\n\nAs a result, e/ffective 1 June 2022 Graham tiver continued as Woodside's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial O/fficer having commenced with Woodside on 1 February 2022, based in Perth. On 1 June 2022, Shiva McMahon commenced as Executive Vice President International Operations transitioning from BHP's petroleum business, to be based in Houston.\n\nE/ffective 1 June 2022 Shaun Gregory's role changed from Executive Vice President Sustainability and Chief technology O/fficer to Executive Vice President New Energy. Mr Gregory ceased to be Executive KMP given the adjustment to the responsibilities of his role. Fiona Hick resigned as Executive Vice President Australian Operations and ceased to be Executive KMP on 28 November 2022. Sherry Duhe resigned as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial O/fficer and ceased to be Executive KMP on 4 February 2022.\n\n## Executive remuneration changes\n\nFollowing the merger with BHP's petroleum business, the Board reviewed remuneration for the CEO and Senior Executives, based on benchmarking against a defined peer group and with consideration of organisation size and structure.\n\nAs a result of the Board's review, the Board approved an increase to Meg O'Neill's fixed and variable remuneration components. E/ffective 1 June 2022, Ms O'Neill's fixed annual remuneration (FAR) increased by A$200,000 to A$2,400,000 with a target value for variable annual reward (VAR) set at A$6,720,000. Remuneration changes approved for the CEO and Senior Executives are outlined in further detail in the Executive KMP KPIs and outcomes for 2022 section of this report.\n\nthe Board also approved changes within the structure of the EIS to ensure it remains competitive in the broader markets in which we now operate. As a result, the cash component of the EIS award for Executive KMP will increase from 12.5% to 20%, positioning the cash opportunity more closely to the defined peer group while maintaining the intent for most of the award to be delivered as equity. these changes are described in further detail in the Remuneration changes section of this report.\n\nAs a part of the review, the 2023 Corporate Scorecard has been updated to comprise of four equally weighted measures which between them cover the same scope as the prior five measures with appropriate emphasis on key performance metrics including material sustainability issues. these changes are outlined in the Remuneration changes section of this report.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFollowing the merger with BHP's petroleum business, we have worked to ensure our integrated remuneration policies and practices align with the new markets in which we operate, to keep Woodside globally competitive. the Board reviewed remuneration for the CEO and Senior Executives based on benchmarking against a defined peer group together with organisation size and structure. As a result, increases were approved that reflect performance and changes to role scope and accountabilities. the VAR outcome for 2022 is above target and recognises the e/fforts of the team to successfully complete the merger while delivering strong operational results and progressing our growth projects and new energy opportunities.\n\nthe Board is proud of the sustained e/fforts of the entire Woodside team throughout 2022. We look forward to our ongoing engagement with Woodside shareholders and sharing in Woodside's future success.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gene Tilbrook\n\nChair of Human Resources & Compensation Committee",

As the world's energy mix evolves we are positioning ourselves to be agile, flexible and adaptable; building on our traditional energy capabilities and maturing opportunities to produce lower carbon energy and provide integrated carbon solutions which are customer-led and scalable.\n\nto do so, the company must be able to attract and retain executive capability in a globally competitive market. the Board structures remuneration so that it rewards those who perform, is valued by Executives, and is aligned with the company's values, strategic direction and the creation of enduring value to shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n\nFixed Annual Reward (FAR) is determined having regard to the scope of each Executive's role and their level of knowledge, skills and experience.\n\nVariable Annual Reward (VAR) is calculated annually, based on performance measures set by the Board aimed at aligning executive remuneration with short and long-term returns. VAR aligns shareholder and executive remuneration outcomes by making a significant portion of executive remuneration at risk, while rewarding performance.\n\nExecutive remuneration is reviewed annually, having regard to the accountabilities, experience and performance of each individual. FAR and VAR are compared against domestic and international competitors at target, to maintain Woodside's capacity to attract and retain talent and to ensure appropriate motivation is provided to Executives to deliver on the company's strategic objectives.\n\n## Executive Incentive Scheme\n\nVAR is delivered under the Woodside Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS). the EIS is structured having regard to the key objectives of executive engagement, alignment with the shareholder experience and strategic fit.\n\n## EXECUTIVE ENGAGEMENT\n\nEnable Woodside to attract and retain executive capability in a globally competitive environment by providing Executives with a clear remuneration structure giving line of sight to how performance is reflected in remuneration outcomes.\n\n## ALIGNMENT WITH THE SHAREHOLDER EXPERIENCE\n\nPromote significant share ownership through equity awards. Equity awards are delivered as a combination of Restricted Shares and Performance Rights. the Performance Rights are Relative total Shareholder Return (RtSR) tested against comparator groups, after five years.\n\nthe EIS delivers a single variable reward linked to challenging individual and company annual targets set by the Board.\n\nEach Executive's award is based on their individual performance against key performance indicators (KPIs) and the company's performance through the Corporate Scorecard. the award is subject to performance in each 12-month period and is determined at the conclusion of each performance year.\n\nthe Corporate Scorecard targets and individual KPIs are designed to promote short-term and long-term shareholder value. Exceeding targets results in an increased award with a linear calculation up to the maximum, while under-performance will result in a reduced award. the minimum award that an\n\n## STRATEGIC FIT\n\nReflect Woodside's strategic time horizons in award deferral periods, to drive Executives to deliver our strategic objectives with discipline and collaboration, in turn creating shareholder value.\n\nExecutive can receive is zero if the performance conditions are not achieved on either company or individual performance.\n\nIndividual performance is assessed by the Board in the case of the CEO, and by the CEO and the Human Resources & Compensation Committee in the case of Senior Executives.\n\nthe Board has strong oversight and governance and seeks to ensure that targets are set to create a clear link between performance and reward. the Board has an overriding discretion which it can and does exercise to adjust outcomes in line with shareholder experience and company or management performance.",

From 1 June 2022 for the CEO the Restricted Share component of VAR is divided into tranches with three, four and five-year deferral periods. there are no further performance conditions attached to these awards. this element creates a strong retention proposition for Executives as vesting is subject to employment not being terminated with cause or by resignation during the deferral period. the deferral mechanism means that the value of awards reflects fluctuations in share price across the deferral periods, which is intended to reflect the sustainability of performance over the medium-term and long-term and support increased alignment between Executives and shareholders.\n\n## Performance Rights\n\nthe Performance Rights are divided into two portions with each portion subject to a separate RtSR performance hurdle tested over a five-year period. Performance is tested after five years as Woodside operates in a capital intensive industry with long investment timelines. It is imperative that Executives take\n\ndecisions in the long-term interest of shareholders, focused on value creation across the commodity price cycles of the oil and gas industry. Our view is that RtSR is the best measure of longterm value creation across the commodity price cycle of our industry.\n\nOne-third of the Performance Rights are tested against a comparator group that comprises the entities within the ASX 50 index at 1 December 2022. the remaining two-thirds are tested against an international group of oil and gas companies, set out in table 11. the international peer group used to measure RtSR for the 2022 EIS award was reviewed and updated to maintain alignment with Woodside's expanded global business activities.\n\nRtSR outcomes are calculated by an external adviser after the conclusion of the performance year. the outcome of the test is measured against the schedule below. For EIS awards, any Performance Rights that do not vest will lapse and are not retested.\n\n## RTSR performance hurdle vesting\n\nTable 3 - Key EIS features\n\n| Woodside RTSR percentile  position within peer group   | Vesting of Performance  Rights   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Less than 50th percentile                              | No vesting                       |\n| Equal to 50th percentile                               | 50% vest                         |\n| Between the 50th and 75th percentile                   | Vesting on a pro-rata basis      |\n| Equal to or greater than 75th percentile               | 100% vest                        |\n\n| Allocation  methodology   | Restricted Shares and Performance Rights are allocated using a face value allocation methodology. the number of  Restricted Shares and Performance Rights is calculated by dividing the value by the volume weighted average price (VWAP)  across December of the performance year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Dividends and  voting     | Executives are entitled to receive dividends on Restricted Shares. No dividends are paid on Performance Rights prior to  vesting.

EBItDA is closely aligned with short-term shareholder value creation. EBItDA is underpinned by e/fficient operational performance and outcomes are exposed to the upside and downside of oil and gas price and foreign exchange fluctuations, as are returns to shareholders.\n\n2022 performance: EBItDA excluding impairment for 2022 was US$11,234 million, significantly above the target of US$6,919 million due to higher realised pricing across all price markers, and higher production.\n\n## Operating Expenditure (20%)\n\nOutcome\n\n5\n\nMID-POINT\n\nMAX\n\nControlling Operating Expenditure brings a focus on e/fficient operations; cost competitiveness; and shareholder returns.\n\n2022 performance: Operating Expenditure for 2022 was A$2,063 million, in line with the target of A$2,072 million excluding costs related to the Wildling well and foreign exchange impacts associated with a stronger US dollar.\n\n## Production (20%)\n\nOutcome\n\n10\n\nMID-POINT\n\nMAX\n\nRevenue is maximised and value generated from Woodside's assets when they are fully utilised in production. Production must be carefully managed throughout the year to optimise value from the assets. the production target for Corporate Scorecard purposes is set relative to the company's annual budget and market guidance.\n\n2022 performance: total production for 2022 was 157.7 MMboe, above the revised market guidance of 153 to 157 MMboe. 1 Performance was higher due to early Interconnector start up and sustained production above committed volumes (+4.9 MMboe), Greater Western Flank Phase 3 acceleration and high reliability at North West Shelf (2.2 MMboe), and higher Bass Strait sales (1.5 MMboe).\n\nthe Board considers performance across material sustainability issues including personal and process safety, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, and our social licence to operate. Strong performance in this area creates and protects value in four ways: it reduces the likelihood of major accident events and catastrophic losses; it maintains Woodside's licence to operate which enables the development of its growth portfolio; it reflects e/fficient, optimised and controlled business processes that generate value; and it supports the company's position as a partner of choice.\n\n2022 performance: Safety performance was below target, with a tRIR of 1.80 compared to a target tRIR of 1.0. Process safety performance was on target with zero tier 1 and one low risk tier 2 process safety event recorded. Gross equity scope 1 and 2 emissions performance in 2022 was 294kt CO 2 -e higher than the target primarily due to increased production.\n\n## Delivery against business priorities (20%)\n\nOutcome\n\n6\n\nMID-POINT\n\nMAX\n\nIn 2022, we focused on progressing Scarborough and Sangomar, finalising the strategic direction to trion and maturing opportunities in new energy and carbon, combined with completing the merger with BHP's petroleum business.\n\n## Merger with BHP's petroleum business\n\n- \u00b7  It was an historic year for Woodside with the successful completion of the merger with BHP's petroleum business according to plan.\n- \u00b7  Woodside has implemented initiatives to deliver greater than US$400 million annual synergies ahead of target. 2\n\n## Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 execution\n\n- \u00b7  Scarborough and Pluto train 2 25% complete, targeting first LNG cargo in 2026.\n- \u00b7  Project remains on schedule and budget.\n\n## Sangomar\n\n- \u00b7  Phase 1 77% complete, targeting first oil late 2023.\n- \u00b7  Drilling on schedule with the first seven development wells delivered.\n- \u00b7  FPSO conversion topsides and turret fabrication complete and successfully relocated to Singapore.\n\n## Overall corporate performance outcome\n\nOutcome\n\n## Trion\n\n- \u00b7  Progressing towards final investment decision (FID) readiness in 2023.\n- \u00b7  Front-end engineering design (FEED) and key technical studies completed.\n- \u00b7  Competitive tenders for major scopes of work issued.\n\n## Maturing key future new energy opportunities\n\n- \u00b7  H2OK progressing towards FID readiness, with FEED scope completed in Q4 2022 and contracts awarded for alkaline electrolyser and liquefaction packages.\n- \u00b7  Concept definition work for H2Perth is progressing to plan.\n- \u00b7  H2tAS concept definition studies and social impact assessment completed.\n- \u00b7  Selected as preferred project partner for Southern Green Hydrogen, non-binding MOU executed with Mitsui.\n\nMID-POINT\n\nMAX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1. the 157.7 MMboe includes production of 156.8 MMboe from Woodside reserves and 0.9 MMboe primarily from feed gas purchased from Pluto non-operating participants processed through the Pluto-KGP Interconnector.\n- 2.

One-third of the LtA was tested against a comparator group that comprises the entities within the ASX 50 index. the remaining two-thirds was tested against an international group of oil and gas companies.\n\nRtSR outcomes are calculated by an external adviser on the fourth anniversary of the allocation. For 2017 awards to Senior Executives, any VPRs that did not vest lapsed in 2022 and are not retested. Awards made to other Executives are eligible for a retest in 2023. VPRs that do not vest following the re-test will lapse. 2017 is the last year of award to which a retest applies.\n\nExecutives are entitled to receive dividends on Restricted Shares. there is no entitlement to dividends on VPRs and VPRs do not carry voting rights. Details of prior year allocations are provided in table 12.\n\n## Supplementary Woodside Equity Plan (SWEP)\n\nIn October 2011, the Board approved the establishment of the SWEP to enable the o/ffering of targeted retention awards of Equity Rights (ERs) for key capability.\n\nthe SWEP was updated in 2022 to broaden eligibility to all employees of a subsidiary of Woodside Energy Group Ltd and ensure compliance in all jurisdictions in which Woodside operates. this facilitated the o/ffer of replacement unvested incentives as required under transitional arrangements for eligible heritage BHP employees transitioning from BHP Group Long-term Incentive (LtI) plans to VAR o/ffered under Woodside's VAR arrangements.\n\nthe SWEP awards have service conditions and no performance conditions. Each ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share or an American Depositary Share on the vesting date three years after the e/ffective grant date.\n\nERs under both the WEP and the SWEP may vest prior to the vesting date on a change of control or on a pro-rata basis, at the discretion of the CEO, limited to the following circumstances; redundancy, retirement (after six months' participation), death, termination due to illness or incapacity or total and permanent",

An employee whose employment is terminated by resignation or for cause prior to the vesting date will forfeit all of their unvested ERs.\n\nIn relation to the applicable cessation of employment treatment for SWEP ERs granted as replacement awards to heritage BHP employees, unless the Board determines otherwise, unvested SWEP ERs will vest on a pro-rata basis in the following circumstances; redundancy, death, termination due to medical illness or incapacity or total and permanent disablement of the participant. For cessation in other circumstances, (and other than where employment is terminated by resignation or for cause), Woodside's CEO (or Committee of the Board, as applicable) has discretion to permit pro-rata vesting.\n\nthere is no entitlement to dividends on ERs and ERs do not carry voting rights.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) Policy\n\nthe Executive MSR Policy reflects the long-term focus of management and aims to further strengthen alignment with shareholders.\n\nthe MSR Policy requires Senior Executives to have acquired and maintained Woodside shares for a minimum total purchase price of at least 100% of their fixed remuneration after a period of five years, and in the case of the CEO a minimum of 200% of fixed remuneration.\n\nOf the Executive KMP, Ms O'Neill meets the MSR requirements. Mr tiver and Ms McMahon commenced with Woodside in 2022 and will continue to acquire Woodside shares. See table 14 for details.\n\n## Other equity awards\n\nWoodside's Equity Award Rules apply to EIS and discretionary executive allocations. this allows the Board and CEO to award discretionary allocations of Restricted Shares or Performance Rights to eligible employees and executives.\n\n## Contracts for Executive KMP\n\nEach Executive KMP has a contract of employment. table 8 below contains a summary of the key contractual provisions of the contracts of employment for the continuing Executive KMP.\n\nTable 8 - Summary of contractual provisions for Executive KMP\n\n|             | Employing company                | Contract duration   | Termination notice  period company 1,2   | Termination notice  period executive   |\n|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| M O'Neill 3 | Woodside Energy Ltd              | Unlimited           | 6 months                                 | 6 months                               |\n| G Tiver 3   | Woodside Energy Ltd              | Unlimited           | 6 months                                 | 6 months                               |\n| S McMahon 3 | Woodside Energy USA Services Inc | Unlimited           | 6 months                                 | 3 months                               |\n\n## Non-executive directors (NEDs)\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nWoodside's Remuneration Policy for NEDs aims to attract, retain, motivate and to remunerate fairly and responsibly having regard to:\n\n- \u00b7  the level of fees paid to NEDs relative to other major Australian listed companies.\n- \u00b7  the size and complexity of Woodside's operations.\n- \u00b7  the responsibilities and work requirements of Board members.\n\nFees paid to NEDs are recommended by the Human Resources & Compensation Committee (Committee) based on benchmarking from external remuneration consultants and determined by the Board. In 2022, the Board approved an increase to annual Board and committee fees to be e/ffective 1 January 2023. this is the first increase since 2019.\n\nFees paid to NEDs are subject to an aggregate limit of A$4.25 million per financial year, which was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM.\n\n## Minimum Shareholding Requirements (MSR) Policy\n\nNEDs are required to have acquired shares for a total purchase price of at least 100% of their pre-tax annual fee after five years on the Board. the NEDs may utilise the Non-executive Directors' Share Plan (NEDSP) to acquire the shares on market at market value. As the shares are acquired with net fees, the shares in the NEDSP are not subject to any forfeiture conditions.\n\nAll NEDs meet the MSR, except Mr Wyatt who joined Woodside on 1 June 2021. Mr Wyatt is participating in the NEDSP and will continue to acquire shares under this plan going forward. See table 14 for details.\n\n## NEDs remuneration structure\n\nNEDs' remuneration consists of base Board fees and committee fees, plus statutory superannuation contributions or payments in lieu (currently 10.5%). Other payments may be made for additional services outside the scope of Board and Committee duties. NEDs do not earn retirement benefits other than superannuation and are not entitled to any form of performance-linked remuneration in order to preserve their independence.",

NEDs are not entitled to compensation on termination of their directorships.\n\nAn allowance is paid to any NED required to travel internationally to attend Board commitments, compensating for factors related to long-haul travel. Where travel is between six and ten hours, an allowance of A$5,000 gross per trip is paid. Where travel exceeds 10 hours, an allowance of A$10,000 gross per trip is paid.\n\nIn 2022, NEDs Frank Cooper, Ben Wyatt and Larry Archibald received an additional payment of A$20,000 each for services provided during the period outside the scope of Board and Committee duties, in connection with the merger with BHP's petroleum business, including membership of the Due Diligence Committee.\n\nBoard fees are not paid to the CEO, as the time spent on Board work and the responsibilities of Board membership are considered in determining the remuneration package provided as part of the normal employment conditions.\n\nthe total remuneration paid to, or in respect of, each NED in 2022 is set out in table 13.\n\nTable 9 - Annual base Board and committee fees for NEDs 1\n\n| Position                         | Board 2 A$   | Audit & Risk  Committee  A$   | Human Resources  & Compensation  Committee  A$   | Sustainability  Committee  A$   | Nominations  & Governance  Committee  A$   |\n|----------------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Chair of the Board/three.num     | 723,300      |                               |                                                  |                                 |                                            |\n| Non-executive directors/four.num | 219,178      |                               |                                                  |                                 |                                            |\n| Committee chair                  |              | 59,360                        | 52,000                                           | 47,400                          | Nil                                        |\n| Committee member                 |              | 31,964                        | 26,500                                           | 23,700                          | Nil                                        |\n\n- 1.

Compensation for US-based employees and US-based KMP is paid in US dollars. Valuation of equity awards is converted at the spot rate applying when the equity award is granted.",

In accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payment , the fair value of equity instruments as at their date of grant has been determined with reference to the closing share price at grant date, or by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing technique or applying the binomial valuation method combined with a Monte Carlo simulation. the fair value of equity instruments is amortised over the vesting period from the commencement of the service period, such that 'total remuneration' includes a portion of the fair value of unvested equity compensation during the year. the portion of the expense relating to the 2022 EIS has been measured using estimated fair values as disclosed in footnote 2 in table 7. the amount included as remuneration is not related to or indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executives may ultimately realise should these equity instruments vest.\n- 6.  the total remuneration in AUD is converted from USD using the exchange rate reflective of the service period. this non-IFRS unaudited information is included for the purposes of showing the total annual cost of benefits to the company in Australian dollars for the service period.\n- 7. Performance related outcome percentage is calculated as total variable annual reward divided by the USD total remuneration figure.\n- 8.

Vesting date and exercise date are the same. Vesting is subject to satisfaction of vesting conditions. Full details of the vesting conditions for all prior year equity grants to Executive KMP are included in the remuneration report for the relevant year.\n- 3.  Any RtSR-tested VPRs allocated to Senior Executives prior to 2017 that do not vest as a result of the first test will be re-tested over a five-year performance period. RtSR-tested VPRs allocated in 2017 and performance rights will not be re-tested. the second test date for earlier VPR allocations is one year after the vesting date listed in the table.\n- 4.  In accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payment , the fair value of VPRs Performance Rights and Equity Rights as at their date of grant has been determined by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing technique or binomial valuation method combined with a Monte Carlo simulation. the amount included as remuneration is not related to or indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executives may ultimately realise should these equity instruments vest.\n- 5.  the fair value of Restricted Shares as at their date of grant has been determined by reference to the share price at acquisition. the fair value is not related to or indicative of the benefit (if any) that individual Executive KMP may ultimately realise should these equity instruments.\n- 6.  Fair values for the 2022 EIS with grant date being 27 February 2023 and expected to be 28 April 2023 have been estimated as disclosed in footnote 2 of table 7. Fair values for the 2021 EIS with grant dates of 16 February 2022 and 19 May 2022 have been trued-up as disclosed in footnote 3 of table 7.\n- 7. the maximum value of the equity instruments awarded for future financial years has been determined as the fair value amount at grant date multiplied by the number of equity instruments awarded, less what has been amortised to date. the minimum total value of the equity instruments awarded for future financial years is nil if relevant vesting conditions are not satisfied.\n- 8.  the RtSR-tested VPRs allocated for the 2015 and 2016 performance year have been updated to include any adjustments made as part of the Retail Entitlement O/ffer.\n- 9.  Ms M O'Neill was granted Performance Rights and Restricted Shares on 19 May 2022 as approved by shareholders at the 2022 Woodside Annual General Meeting under Listing Rule 10.14. the grant of the Performance Rights and Restricted Shares components of Ms O'Neill's 2022 EIS award is subject to shareholder approval at the 2023 Woodside Annual General Meeting. the grant date for Performance Rights and Restricted Shares is the date of shareholder approval.\n- 10. Mr S Gregory ceased being an Executive KMP on 31 May 2022. Mr Gregory's Restricted Shares and Performance Rights remain on foot and will vest in the ordinary course subject to the satisfaction of applicable conditions.\n- 11.  Ms F Hick ceased being an Executive KMP on 28 November 2022. Ms Hick's Restricted Shares, VPR's and Performance Rights lapsed e/ffective 24 February 2023.\n- 12.  Ms S Duhe resigned on 16 November 2021 and ceased being an Executive KMP on 4 February 2022. Ms Duhe's Restricted Shares, VPR's and Performance Rights lapsed on 7 February 2022.",

As a result, the Group recognised a pre-tax gain of $427 million on the transaction. This includes variable consideration which has been remeasured as at 31 December 2022 with a $71 million revaluation gain recognised as other income (refer to Note B.7).\n- \u00b7   The Pluto-KGP Interconnector achieved 'ready for start-up' and commenced flowing gas from the o/ffshore Pluto fields to Karratha Gas Plant (KGP) for processing in March 2022.\n- \u00b7   On 1 June 2022, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (BHPP) (subsequently renamed Woodside Energy Global Holdings Pty Ltd), which held BHP Group's oil and gas business (refer to Note B.5).\n- \u00b7  As part of ongoing rationalisation of the Group's exploration portfolio, the Group exited the Orphan Basin exploration licences in Canada. As a result, a net expense of $142 million reflecting various exit costs was recognised in exploration and evaluation expenditure (refer to Note A.1).\n- \u00b7   The Group recognised a $382 million reduction in restoration provisions as a net result of an increase in the risk free rates and current period payments, o/ffset by an increase in cost estimates (refer to Note D.5). The majority of this was recognised as a corresponding decrease in oil and gas properties.\n- \u00b7   The Group hedged an increased percentage of its exposure to commodity price and foreign exchange risk through commodity swaps and foreign exchange forward derivatives (refer to Note D.6).\n- \u00b7  The Group recognised a $1,362 million increase to the Pluto PRRT Deferred Tax Asset (DTA), primarily as a result of higher assessable revenue in 2022 and higher forecast assessable revenue driven by changes to pricing assumptions (refer to Note A.5).\n- \u00b7  The Group recognised a pre-tax impairment reversal of $900 million for the Wheatstone cash-generating unit, primarily due to a revision in LNG price assumptions (refer to Note B.4).\n\nW",

        "page_content": "Notes to the financial statements\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## About these statements\n\nFollowing the approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 19 May 2022, Woodside Petroleum Ltd has registered the change of company name to Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Woodside Energy Group Ltd and its controlled entities (Woodside or the Group) is a for-profit entity limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) (with trades settled in the form of UK Depository Interests) and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (in the form of Woodside American Depositary Shares). The nature of the operations and the principal activities of the Group are described in the Directors' Report and in the segment information in Note A.1.\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2023.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements are general purpose financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 , Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB). The financial statements comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. They also include additional disclosures required for foreign registrants by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC).\n\nSubsequent to the merger with BHPP, BHPP's accounting policies have been aligned with the Group. The Group's accounting policies are consistent with those disclosed in the Group's 2021 Financial Statements except for new policies applicable in 2022. Adoption of new or amended standards and interpretations e/ffective 1 January 2022 did not result in any significant changes to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nEstimates have been revised, where required, to reflect current market conditions including the impact of COVID-19 and climate change. Updated assumptions used for impairment assessments and the measurement of onerous contracts are disclosed in Notes B.4 and D.5 respectively; these assumptions could change in the future. New estimates and judgements for significant transactions during the period including the recognition of goodwill as a result of the business combination, the allocation of goodwill to the Group's cash generating units, and the sell-down of Train 2 are disclosed in Notes B.5, B.4 and B.7 respectively.\n\n## Currency\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of Woodside and all its material subsidiaries is the US dollar.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the transacting entity at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting\n\ndate are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at that date. Exchange di/fferences in the consolidated financial statements are taken to the income statement.\n\n## Rounding of amounts\n\nThe amounts contained in these financial statements have been rounded to the nearest million dollars under the option available to the Group under Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Corporations (Rounding in Financial/ Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191 dated 24 March 2016, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments and certain other financial assets and financial liabilities, which have been measured at fair value or amortised cost adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risks that are being hedged in e/ffective hedge relationships. Where not carried at fair value, if the carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities does not approximate their fair value, the fair value has been included in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe financial statements comprise the financial position and results of the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022 (refer to Note E.8).\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained by the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date at which the Group ceases to have control.\n\nThe subsidiaries of the Group apply the same reporting period and accounting policies as the parent company in their financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.\n\nNon-controlling interests are allocated their share of the net profit after tax in the consolidated income statement and their share of other comprehensive income net of tax in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, and are presented within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders' equity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous periods. Where required, a reclassification of items in the financial statements of the previous periods has been made in accordance with the classification of items in the financial statements of the current period.\n\n## Climate change and energy transition Climate considerations\n\nWoodside has considered the impact of climate and the energy transition in assessing the carrying value of its assets and liabilities. This note describes climate-related assumptions that underpin key areas of the financial statements and the potential short- and long-term impacts di/ffering scenarios could have on the financial results and financial position of Woodside.\n\nW",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## Climate change and energy transition (cont.)\n\n## Financial planning and assumptions\n\nWoodside considers a range of climate and macroeconomic scenarios to help benchmark our long-term price assumptions and inform our decision making to ensure we maintain a resilient financial position. The assumptions applied in assessing amounts within the financial statements are in each case calculated in accordance with the requirements of the applicable accounting standards.\n\nOur long-term price assumptions reflect management's current 'best estimate' scenario in which global governments pursue decarbonisation as well as other goals such as energy security and economic development. All price assumptions consider current legislation in the locations where Woodside operates and place some weight on scenarios in which the transition to a low carbon energy system is su/fficiently rapid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the transition is not, or may not be, su/fficiently rapid. They also place some weight on a range of other assumptions which can drive prices (e.g. inflation) and which are not related to the Paris goals.\n\nWoodside's facilities are subject to physical risks such as oceanic conditions and are located in regions that experience tropical cyclones, hurricanes and high ambient temperatures. Woodside has significant experience designing and operating facilities located in harsh environments.\n\nWoodside notes that the high degree of uncertainty around the nature, timing and magnitude of climate-related risks, and the uncertainty as to how the energy transition will evolve, makes it di/fficult to determine and disclose the risks and their potential impacts with precision.\n\nWoodside continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks and will revise commodity and carbon pricing assumptions accordingly. Oil and gas investment cases include a carbon price assumption which takes into consideration uncertainty around the impact of climate change. Commodity pricing assumptions are key value drivers with greater significance to assets and liabilities than carbon pricing.\n\n## Impairment of exploration and evaluation, oil and gas properties and goodwill\n\nIn accordance with IFRS, elements of Woodside's financial statements are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that may exist in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe estimation of recoverable amounts for impairment testing includes estimating what an independent market participant would pay to acquire the asset as at the reporting date. Market participants will be guided by their own views on future economic and technical conditions and therefore Woodside considers a range of data sources in determining a future price forecast, including industry and market benchmarks along with asset sales transaction data.\n\nPrice forecasts are adjusted for premiums and discounts based on the nature and quality of the product. Brent oil price\n\nestimates have considered the impacts of climate policies along with other factors such as industry investment and cost trends. There remains significant uncertainty around how society will respond to the climate challenge.\n\nThe energy transition is expected to bring volatility and there is uncertainty as to how commodity prices will develop over the medium and long term. The IEA's World Energy Outlook 2022 (WEO) explores three main climate change scenarios. The IEA scenarios are not predictions and the IEA does not have a single view on the future of the energy system. There is significant uncertainty as to whether any of these scenarios will eventuate. Because Woodside considers what a market participant would pay to acquire an asset in assessing impairments, these external scenarios are not necessarily consistent with the pricing assumptions used for the Group's impairment assessment as disclosed in Table A below and Note B.4 Impairment of exploration and evaluation, oil and gas properties and goodwill.\n\nThe WEO explores three main scenarios/one.num:\n\n- \u00b7  The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)\n- \u00b7  The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS)\n- \u00b7  The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)\n\nAverage Brent\n\nTable A: Average real terms 2022 oil price (US$/bbl, Brent)/two.num, North Asian LNG price (US$/MMbtu)/two.num and carbon price (US$/tCO/two.inf-e)/three.num consistent with IEA dataset compared against Woodside's assumptions:\n\n| Average Brent   (RT US$/bbl)            | 2023-2026   | 2027-2031   | 2032-2036   | 2037-2040   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| NZE                                     | 59          | 38          | 33          | 31          |\n| APS                                     | 88          | 70          | 65          | 65          |\n| STEPS                                   | 92          | 85          | 85          | 88          |\n| Woodside                                | 75          | 70          | 70          | 70          |\n| Average North Asian  LNG (RT US$/MMbtu) | 2023-2026   | 2027-2031   | 2032-2036   | 2037-2040   |\n| NZE                                     | 18          | 6           | 6           | 6           |\n| APS                                     | 20          | 9           | 9           | 9           |\n| STEPS                                   | 21          | 11          | 11          | 11          |\n| Woodside                                | 23          | 9           | 9           | 9           |\n| Average Carbon  (RT US$/tonne)          | 2023-2026   | 2027-2031   | 2032-2036   | 2037-2040   |\n| NZE                                     | 100         | 135         | 169         | 199         |\n| APS                                     | 98          | 130         | 154         | 172         |\n| STEPS                                   | 80          | 80          | 80          | 80          |\n| Woodside                                | 80          | 80          | 80          | 80          |",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## Climate change and energy transition (cont.)\n\n## Impairment of exploration and evaluation, oil and gas properties and goodwill (cont.)\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for the sensitivity analysis performed on Woodside's Brent oil pricing assumptions and the potential impact on the carrying value of Woodside's non-current assets.\n\nThe benchmarked pricing above has limitations and is based on a wide range of assumptions. The impact of the benchmark pricing assumptions could be managed by decisions Woodside could make in response such as acquisitions, divestments or cost reductions as well as other consequential changes. The scenarios must therefore not be interpreted as Woodside's investment guidance. These are scenarios, not forecasts, and no likelihood is assigned to any of these scenarios eventuating.\n\n## Impact on remaining life of assets\n\nOil and gas properties relating to transferred exploration and evaluation and o/ffshore plant and equipment are depreciated using the unit of production basis over either proved or proved plus probable reserves. The energy transition may result in changes to the expected useful life of oil and gas properties and economically recoverable reserves and resources thereby accelerating depreciation charges or resulting in an impairment.\n\n## Restoration and other provisions\n\nThe energy transition may result in restoration activities occurring earlier than expected. 54% (2021: 65%) of the Group's non-current restoration liabilities are expected to be settled more than 10 years in the future.\n\nRestoration cost estimates require judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations and the extent of restoration activities required.\n\nThese cost estimates may change in the future, as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny and the energy transition. Woodside continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks to assess if additional changes to restoration provisions should be recognised.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nClosure or early termination of activities may lead to supply contracts becoming onerous. As at 31 December 2022, the Corpus Christi contract is expected to return a positive value and on this basis the onerous contract provision has been reversed to nil (2021: $214 million). This and other contractual arrangements could be impacted by adverse market conditions arising from climate-related factors.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nThe Group has determined that it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise the deferred tax assets relating to carry forward unused tax losses and credits recognised as at 31 December 2022. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent on the Group's future taxable income which can be impacted by the uncertainty of commodity and carbon pricing.\n\n## Regulatory environment\n\nRegulation of climate-related emissions can change over time. Woodside is not currently aware of specific proposals that would materially change the assumptions underpinning the financial statements.\n\nW",

The Board of Directors and the Audit and Risk Committee have oversight of the Group's internal control system and risk management process, including oversight of the internal audit function.\n\nThe Group's management of financial and capital risks is aimed at ensuring that available capital, funding and cash flows are su/fficient to:\n\n- \u00b7  meet the Group's financial commitments as and when they fall due;\n- \u00b7  maintain the capacity to fund its committed project developments;\n- \u00b7  pay a reasonable dividend; and\n- \u00b7  maintain a long-term credit rating of not less than 'investment grade'.\n\nThe Group monitors and tests its forecast financial position against these criteria and, in general, will undertake hedging activity when necessary to ensure that these objectives are achieved.\n\nOther circumstances that may lead to hedging include the management of exposures relating to trading activities. It is, and has been throughout the period, the Group Treasury policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. Refer to Section 3.8 Risk Factors for more information on the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing financial risk.\n\nThe below risks arise in the normal course of the Group's business. Risk information can be found in the following sections:\n\nSection A\n\nCommodity price risk management Page 109\n\nSection A\n\nForeign exchange risk management\n\nPage 109\n\nSection C\n\nCapital risk management\n\nPage 132\n\nSection C\n\nLiquidity risk management\n\nPage 132\n\nSection C\n\nInterest rate risk management\n\nPage 132\n\nSection D\n\nCredit risk management\n\nPage 136\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nIn applying the Group's accounting policies, management continually evaluates judgements, estimates and assumptions based on experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have an impact on the Group. All judgements, estimates and assumptions made are believed to be reasonable based on the most current set of circumstances known to management, and actual results may di/ffer. Significant judgements, estimates and assumptions made by management in the preparation of these financial statements are found in the following notes:\n\n| Note A.1   | Revenue from contracts with customers                                          | Page 110   |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Note A.5   | Taxes                                                                          | Page 115   |\n| Note B.2   | Exploration and evaluation                                                     | Page 120   |\n| Note B.3   | Oil and gas properties                                                         | Page 121   |\n| Note B.4   | Impairment of exploration and evaluation,  oil and gas properties and goodwill | Page 123   |\n| Note B.5   | Business combination                                                           | Page 128   |\n| Note B.6   | Significant production and growth asset  acquisitions                          | Page 130   |\n| Note B.7   | Disposal of assets                                                             | Page 131   |\n| Note D.5   | Provisions                                                                     | Page 138   |\n| Note D.6   | Other financial assets and liabilities                                         | Page 140   |\n| Note D.7   | Leases                                                                         | Page 143   |\n| Note E.6   | Joint arrangements                                                             | Page 149   |",

Earnings for the year\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## In this section\n\nThis section addresses financial performance of the Group for the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made. This section also includes the tax position of the Group for and at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## A.  Earnings for the year\n\nA.1  Segment revenue and expenses\n\nPage 110\n\nA.2  Finance costs\n\nPage 114\n\nA.3  Dividends paid and proposed\n\nPage 114\n\nA.4  Earnings/(losses) per share\n\nPage 114\n\nA.5 Taxes\n\nPage 115\n\n## Key financial and capital risks in this section\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nThe Group's revenue is exposed to commodity price fluctuations through the sale of hydrocarbons. Commodity price risks are measured by monitoring and stress testing the Group's forecast financial position to sustained periods of low oil and gas prices. This analysis is regularly performed on the Group's portfolio and as required for discrete projects and transactions.\n\nThe Group's management of commodity price risk includes the use of commodity derivatives to hedge its exposure (refer to Note D.6). The hedged exposure includes oil-linked revenue related to produced volumes and revenues derived from trading operations. Commodity derivatives protect the Group against downside price risk within its strategic and trading portfolio.\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group held hedging financial instruments with a net liability carrying value of $557 million (2021: $431 million) exposed to commodity price risk. An increase in relevant commodity prices of 10% would increase the instruments' net liability by $219 million, the e/ffect of which would be recognised within reserves and/or the income statement in accordance with hedge accounting application. A 10% decrease would have the same but opposite e/ffect. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant (including the price on underlying physical exposures).\n\n## Foreign exchange risk management\n\nForeign exchange risk arises from future commitments, financial assets and financial liabilities that are not denominated in US dollars. The majority of the Group's revenue is denominated in US dollars. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from operating and capital expenditure incurred in currencies other than US dollars, particularly Australian dollars.\n\nThe Group's management of foreign exchange risk relating to capital expenditure includes the use of forward exchange contract derivatives to hedge its exposure (refer to Note D.6).\n\nAs at the reporting date, the Group held hedging financial instruments with a net liability carrying value of $17 million (2021: net asset carrying value of $10 million) exposed to foreign exchange risk.\n\nMeasuring the exposure to foreign exchange risk is achieved by regularly monitoring and performing sensitivity analysis on the Group's financial position.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the exchange rate of the US dollar to the Australian dollar (+12%/-12% (2021: +12%/-12%)), with all other variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the Group's equity or the income statement. Refer to Notes C1, C2, D2, D4 and D7 for details of the denominations of cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing liabilities, receivables, payables and lease liabilities held at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to fix the Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to a portion of the Australian dollar denominated capital expenditure incurred or expected to be incurred under the Scarborough development from 2022 to 2025 (refer to Note D.6). In order to hedge the foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk (refer to Section C) of a Swiss Franc (CHF) denominated medium term note, Woodside holds a number of cross-currency interest rate swaps (refer to Notes C.2 and D.6). The aim of these investments is to convert the fixed interest CHF bond into variable interest US dollar debt.\n\nW",

Earnings for the year\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## A.1 Segment revenue and expenses\n\n## Operating segment information\n\nThe Group has identified its operating segments based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the Chief Executive O/fficer (Chief Operating Decision Maker) in assessing performance and determining the allocation of resources.\n\nAs a result of the merger with BHPP on 1 June 2022, the Group has transformed into a global energy company which has led to a change in how financial information is reported in the Group. The disclosed operating segments have been updated to reflect this change and the 2021 and 2020 amounts have been restated to be presented on the same basis.\n\nOperating segments outlined below are identified by management based on the nature and geographical location of the business and venture.\n\n## Australia:\n\nExploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of liquified natural gas, pipeline gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in Australia.\n\n## International:\n\nExploration, evaluation, development, production and sale of pipeline gas, crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in international jurisdictions outside of Australia.\n\n## Marketing:\n\nMarketing, Shipping and Trading of Woodside's oil and gas portfolio (including non-produced volumes) and optimisation activities attributed to Marketing which have generated incremental value.\n\n## Corporate/Other items:\n\nCorporate/Other items comprise primarily corporate nonsegmental items of revenue and expenses and associated assets and liabilities not allocated to operating segments as they are not considered part of the core operations of any segment.\n\nIn addition to the updated segments, the Group has reassessed the reporting of revenue from the sale of liquified natural gas on a portfolio basis. With the Marketing segment separately reported for the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group will no longer report revenue from the sale of liquified natural gas on a portfolio basis to better represent the revenues and margins generated by each segment. 2021 and 2020 amounts have been restated to be presented on the same basis.\n\n## Major customer information\n\nThe Group has two major customers which respectively account for 12% and 9% of the Group's external revenue. The sales are generated by the Australia and Marketing operating segments (2021: two major customers; 8% and 6% generated by the Australia operating segment and 2020: two major customers; 15% and 13% generated by the Australia operating segment).\n\n| Geographical  information   | Revenue from external  customers 1   | Revenue from external  customers 1   | Revenue from external  customers 1   | Non-current  assets 2   | Non-current  assets 2   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                             | 2022                                 | 2021                                 | 2020                                 | 2022                    | 2021                    |\n|                             | US$m                                 | US$m                                 | US$m                                 | US$m                    | US$m                    |\n| Asia Pacific                | 12,521                               | 6,342                                | 3,362                                | 36,966                  | 18,386                  |\n| Americas                    | 1,545                                | -                                    | -                                    | 7,057                   | 1                       |\n| Africa                      | -                                    | -                                    | -                                    | 4,049                   | 2,802                   |\n| Europe                      | 2,751                                | 620                                  | 238                                  | -                       | -                       |\n| Consolidated                | 16,817                               | 6,962                                | 3,600                                | 48,072                  | 21,189                  |\n\n- 1. Revenue is attributable to geographic location based on the location of the customers.\n- 2.  Non-current assets exclude deferred tax of $1,959 million (2021: $1,007 million).\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when or as the Group transfers control of products or provides services to a customer at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled. If the consideration includes a variable component, the Group estimates the amount of the expected consideration receivable. Variable consideration is estimated throughout the contract and is recognised to the extent that it is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue from sale of hydrocarbons - Revenue from the sale of hydrocarbons is recognised at a point in time when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Revenue from take or pay contracts is recorded as unearned revenue until the product has been drawn by the customer (transfer of control), at which time it is recognised in earnings.\n- \u00b7 Other operating revenue - Revenue earned from LNG processing and other services is recognised over time as the services are rendered.\n\n## Expenses\n\n- \u00b7 Royalties, excise and levies -Royalties, excise and levies are considered to be production-based taxes and are therefore accrued on the basis of the Group's entitlement to physical production.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisatio n - Refer to Note B.3.\n- \u00b7 Impairment and impairment reversals - Refer to Note B.4.\n- \u00b7 Leases - Refer to Note D.7.\n- \u00b7 Employee benefits - Refer to Note E.2.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe transaction price at the date control passes for sales made subject to provisional pricing periods in oil and condensate contracts is determined with reference to quoted commodity prices.\n\nJudgement is also used to determine if it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in relation to revenue recognised during open pricing periods in LNG contracts. The Group estimates variable consideration based on available information from contract negotiations and market indicators.",

The weighted average number of shares makes allowance for shares reserved for employee share plans. Diluted earnings/(losses) per share is calculated by adjusting basic earnings/(losses) per share by the number of ordinary shares that would be issued on conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. At 31 December 2022, 13,061,376 awards (2021: 9,023,439 awards) granted under the Woodside employee share plans are considered dilutive. Total outstanding share awards as at 31 December 2020 were 9,392,203 and considered anti-dilutive due to the loss position in 2020.\n\nThere have been no significant transactions involving ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements A. Earnings for the year\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## A.5  Taxes (cont.)\n\n## Tax transparency code\n\nWoodside participates in the Australian Board of Taxation's voluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC). To increase public confidence in the contributions and compliance of corporate taxpayers, the TTC recommends public disclosure of tax information. Part A of the recommended disclosures are addressed within this Taxes note and Part B within our Sustainable Development Report, supported by additional information on our website.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised. The tax rates and laws used to determine the amount are based on those that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period. Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity.\n\n## Current taxes\n\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the current year and any adjustment to tax paid in respect of previous years.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred tax expense represents movements in the temporary di/fferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the consolidated statement of financial position and its tax base.\n\nWith the exception of those noted below, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary di/fferences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary di/fferences, unused tax losses and tax credits only if it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise those temporary di/fferences and losses.\n\nDeferred tax is not recognised if the temporary di/fference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that a/ffects neither accounting profit nor the taxable profit.\n\nIn relation to PRRT, the impact of future augmentation on expenditure is included in the determination of future taxable profits when assessing the extent to which a deferred tax asset can be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## O/ffsetting deferred tax balances\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are o/ffset only if there is a legally enforceable right to o/ffset current tax assets and liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or di/fferent taxable entities that the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. Refer to Notes E.8 and E.9 for detail on the tax consolidated groups.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Income tax classification\n\nJudgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax. PRRT is considered, for accounting purposes, to be an income tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to other types of taxes, e.g. North West Shelf royalties, excise and levies which are recognised in cost of sales in the income statement.\n\n## (b)  Deferred tax asset recognition\n\nIncome tax losses and credits: Deferred tax assets (DTAs) relating to carry forward unused tax losses and credits arising from the USA Tax Consolidation Group (USA TCG) of $1,371 million (2021: nil) and $93 million (2021: nil) arising from regions other than Australia and the USA have been recognised. The Group has determined that it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise those losses within those regions. Refer to Note E.9(a) for details of tax consolidated groups.\n\nDTAs relating to carry forward unused tax losses and credits of $250 million from the USA TCG, $146 million from USA entities outside of the USA TCG and $1,061 million from regions other than Australia and the USA have not been recognised as it is not currently probable that the assets will be utilised based on current planned activities in those regions (2021: $497 million unrecognised DTAs).\n\nPRRT: The recoverability of PRRT deferred tax assets is primarily assessed with regard to future oil price assumptions impacting forecast future taxable profits. As a result of higher actual and forecast assessable revenues supporting future recoverability of unrecognised quarantined exploration and general expenditure, the Pluto PRRT DTA has increased by $1,362 million. In determining the amount of DTA that is considered probable and eligible for recognition, forecast future taxable profits are risk-adjusted where appropriate by a market premium risk rate to reflect uncertainty inherent in long-term forecasts. A long-term bond rate of 3.2% (31 December 2021: 1.5%) was used for the purposes of augmentation.\n\nCertain deferred tax assets on deductible temporary di/fferences have not been recognised on the basis that deductions from future augmentation of the recognised deductible temporary di/fference will be su/fficient to o/ffset future taxable profits. $6,523 million (2021: $4,507 million) relates to the North West Shelf Project, $189 million (2021: $1,432 million) relates to remaining Pluto quarantined exploration expenditure and $831 million (2021: $1,071 million) relates to Wheatstone. A long-term bond rate of 3.2% (31 December 2021: 1.5%) was used for the purposes of augmentation.\n\nHad an alternative approach been used to assess recovery of the deferred tax assets, whereby future augmentation was not included in the assessment, additional deferred tax assets would be recognised, with a corresponding benefit to tax expense. It was determined that the approach adopted provides the most meaningful information on the implications of the PRRT regime, whilst ensuring compliance with AASB 112/ IAS 12 Income Taxes .\n\n## (c) Uncertain tax positions\n\nThe Group has tax matters, litigation and other claims, for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflows are uncertain. Where the Group assesses an outcome for any tax matter, litigation or other claim as more likely than not to be accepted by the relevant tax authority, the position is adopted in the reported tax balances.\n\nBecause of the complexity of some of these positions the ultimate outcome may di/ffer from the current estimate of the position. These di/fferences will be reflected as increases or decreases to tax expense in the period in which new information is available.",

All exploration and evaluation expenditure, including general permit activity, geological and geophysical costs and new venture activity costs, is expensed as incurred except for the following:\n\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure relates to an exploration discovery for which the assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable hydrocarbons is not yet complete; or\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure is expected to be recouped through successful exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale.\n\nThe costs of acquiring interests in new exploration and evaluation licences are capitalised. The costs of drilling exploration wells are initially capitalised pending the results of the well.\n\nCosts are expensed where the well does not result in the successful discovery of economically recoverable hydrocarbons and the recognition of an area of interest.\n\nSubsequent to the recognition of an area of interest, all further evaluation costs relating to that area of interest are capitalised. Upon approval for the commercial development of an area of interest, accumulated expenditure for the area of interest is transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of cash flows, those cash flows associated with capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, including unsuccessful wells, are classified as cash flows used in investing activities.\n\n## Exploration commitments\n\nThe Group has exploration expenditure obligations which are contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements. These obligations may be varied from time to time and are expected to be fulfilled in the normal course of the Group's operations.\n\n## Impairment\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for details on impairment, including any write-o/ffs.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Area of interest\n\nTypically, an area of interest (AOI) is defined by the Group as an individual geographical area whereby the presence of hydrocarbons is considered favourable or proved to exist. The Group has established criteria to recognise and maintain an AOI.\n\n## (b) Transfer to projects in development\n\nDevelopment activities commence after project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management. Judgement is applied by management in determining when the project is technically feasible and economically viable to transfer to projects in development.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## B.3  Oil and gas properties (cont.)\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nOil and gas properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Oil and gas properties include the costs to acquire, construct, install or complete production and infrastructure facilities such as pipelines and platforms, capitalised borrowing costs, transferred exploration and evaluation assets, development wells and the estimated cost of dismantling and restoration.\n\nSubsequent capital costs, including major maintenance, are included in the asset's carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be reliably measured.\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nOil and gas properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values at rates based on their expected useful lives.\n\nTransferred exploration and evaluation and o/ffshore plant and equipment are depreciated using the unit of production basis over proved plus probable reserves or proved reserves for late life assets. The depreciable amount for the unit of production basis excludes future development costs necessary to bring probable reserves into production. For certain o/ffshore assets, methodologies using proved and probable reserves are adjusted to best reflect the expected pattern of consumption. Onshore plant and equipment is depreciated using a straight-line basis over the lesser of useful life and the life of proved plus probable reserves. On a straight-line basis the assets have an estimated useful life of 5-50 years.\n\nAll other items of oil and gas properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful life. They are depreciated as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Buildings - 24-50 years;\n- \u00b7  Plant and equipment - 2-40 years; and\n- \u00b7  Land is not depreciated.\n\n## Impairment\n\nRefer to Note B.4 for details on impairment.\n\n## Capital commitments\n\nThe Group has capital expenditure commitments contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements, of $7,762 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: $7,875 million). Capital expenditure commitments relate predominantly to the Scarborough and Sangomar projects.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Reserves\n\nThe estimation of reserves requires significant management judgement and interpretation of complex geological and geophysical models in order to make an assessment of the size, shape, depth and quality of reservoirs, and their anticipated recoveries.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depreciation and amortisation charges for the Group's oil and gas properties. Judgement is used in determining the economic reserve base applied to each asset. Typically, late life oil assets use proved reserves.\n\nEstimates are reviewed at least annually or when there are changes in the economic circumstances impacting specific assets or asset groups. These changes may impact depreciation, asset carrying values, restoration provisions and deferred tax balances. If proved plus probable (2P) reserves estimates are revised downwards, earnings could be a/ffected by higher depreciation expense or an immediate write-down of the asset's carrying value.\n\n## (b) Depreciation and amortisation\n\nJudgement is required to determine when assets are available for use to commence depreciation and amortisation. Depreciation and amortisation generally commences on first production.",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## B.4   Impairment of exploration and evaluation, oil and gas properties and goodwill\n\n## Exploration and evaluation Impairment testing\n\nThe recoverability of the carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets is dependent on successful development and commercial exploitation, or alternatively sale of the respective AOI.\n\nEach AOI is reviewed half-yearly to determine whether economic quantities of hydrocarbons have been found, or whether further exploration and evaluation work is underway or planned to support continued carry forward of capitalised costs. Where a potential impairment is indicated for an AOI, an assessment is performed using a fair value less costs to dispose (FVLCD) method to determine its recoverable amount. Upon approval for commercial development, exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment before they are transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\n## Impairment calculations\n\nThe recoverable amounts of exploration and evaluation assets are determined using FVLCD, as there is no value in use (VIU). Costs to dispose are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an AOI exceeds its recoverable amount, the AOI is written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nFor assets previously impaired, if the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount, the impairment is reversed, but only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been recognised if no impairment had occurred.\n\n## Oil and gas properties Impairment testing\n\nThe carrying amounts of oil and gas properties are assessed half-yearly to determine whether there is an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal for those assets which have previously been impaired. Indicators of impairment and impairment reversals include changes in reserves, expected future sales prices or costs.\n\nOil and gas properties are assessed for impairment indicators and impairments on a cash-generating unit (CGU) basis. CGUs are determined as o/ffshore and onshore facilities, infrastructure and associated oil and/or gas fields.\n\nIf there is an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal for a CGU, its recoverable amount is calculated and compared with the CGU's carrying value (refer to impairment calculations below).\n\n## Goodwill\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of each CGU to which the goodwill relates and comparing it with its carrying value, which includes deferred taxes (refer to impairment calculations below and Note B.5).\n\nWhen part of an operation is disposed of, any goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation in determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## Goodwill and oil and gas impairment calculations\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its VIU and FVLCD.\n\nVIU is determined by estimating future cash flows after taking into account the risks specific to the asset and discounting to present value using an appropriate discount rate.\n\nFVLCD is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the e/ffects of factors that may be specific to the Group. In determining FVLCD, recent market transactions are considered. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model, such as discounted cash flow techniques, are applied on a post-tax basis using an appropriate discount rate and estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or CGU.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or CGU, including any allocated goodwill, exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is written down to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Any impairment losses are first allocated to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated, with the remaining impairment losses allocated to the relevant assets.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its carrying amount, and that asset has previously been impaired, the impairment is reversed. The carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the carrying amount does not exceed the value that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed.\n\nW",

The carrying amount of each CGU includes all assets allocated to the respective CGU. Refer to key estimates and judgements for further details.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nRecoverable amount valuations are sensitive to changes in certain key accounting estimates and judgements (refer to key estimates and judgements for further details). Reasonable possible changes to these key assumptions are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Post tax discount rate - plus or minus 1.5% (representing a change of 150 basis points)\n- \u00b7  Commodity pricing - plus or minus 10%\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange (FX) rate - plus or minus 12%\n- \u00b7  Production volumes - plus or minus 4%\n\nManagement's analysis on the impact of reasonable possible changes to these assumptions on recoverable amounts is detailed below.",

This does not incorporate decisions management may take in order to mitigate the change in assumptions.\n\n## CGUs with goodwill\n\nThe valuation of CGUs with goodwill are most sensitive to changes in commodity prices and discount rates. Reasonably possible changes in these estimates which could result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount, assuming all other variables are held constant, are as follows:\n\n|                        | CGU               | Commodity price/one.num % change   | Nominal discount rate (absolute terms)   |\n|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Oil and gas properties | Pluto-Scarborough | N/A/two.sup                        | N/A/two.sup                              |\n| Oil and gas properties | NWS Gas           | N/A/two.sup                        | N/A/two.sup                              |\n| Oil and gas properties | Shenzi            | (7%)                               | N/A/two.sup                              |\n| Oil and gas properties | Atlantis          | (2%)                               | 10%                                      |\n\nA change in any of the above assumptions would have an impact on other assumptions which when considered together may o/ffset. This does not incorporate decisions management may take in order to mitigate the change in assumptions. Management considers there to be no reasonably possible changes in production volumes, carbon prices or foreign exchange rates that would, in isolation result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount. Analysis of key assumptions which could result in the carrying value to equal the recoverable value provides a basis to assess the magnitude of a reasonable possible change to the carrying amounts of respective CGUs.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## CGU determination\n\nIdentification of a CGU requires management judgement. In determining CGUs for acquired assets during the reporting period, management has assessed based on the smallest group of assets that generate significant cash inflows that are independent from other assets or groups of assets.\n\n## Allocation of goodwill\n\nAllocation of goodwill to the relevant CGUs requires management judgement. The goodwill arising from the merger has been allocated to relevant CGUs which are expected to benefit from the expected synergies as a result of the merger.\n\n## Recoverable amount calculation key assumptions\n\nIn determining the recoverable amount of CGUs, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows when determining the\n\nFVLCD. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can also a/ffect the assumptions used and the rates used to discount future cash flow estimates.\n\nThe basis for each estimate used to determine recoverable amounts as at 31 December 2022 is set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Resource estimates - 2P and a portion of 2C reserves (where applicable) for oil and gas properties. The reserves are as disclosed in the Reserves and Resources Statement in the 31 December 2022 Annual Report.\n- \u00b7  Inflation rate - an inflation rate of 2.0% has been applied for US based assets and 2.5% for Australian based assets.\n- \u00b7  Foreign exchange rates - a rate of $0.75 US$:AU$ is based on management's view of long-term exchange rates.\n\nW",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## B.5  Business combination\n\n## BHP Petroleum merger\n\nOn 17 August 2021, Woodside and BHP Group (BHP) entered into a merger commitment deed to combine their respective oil and gas portfolios by an all-stock merger. The Share Sale Agreement (SSA) and the integration and transition services agreement were executed on 22 November 2021. Under the SSA, the merger took economic e/ffect from 1 July 2021 and Woodside became entitled to the economic benefits and risks of the assets and liabilities that were the subject of the merger from that date.\n\nOn 19 May 2022, 98.66% of Woodside shareholders voted in favour of the merger at Woodside's Annual General Meeting.\n\nOn 1 June 2022, the transaction was completed with the Group acquiring 100% of the issued share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (subsequently renamed Woodside Energy Global Holdings Pty Ltd), which held BHP's oil and gas business. In exchange, the Group issued 914,768,948 new Woodside shares to BHP as part of the merger consideration. The transaction has been accounted for as a business combination with an acquisition date of 1 June 2022. The Group's net profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2022 incorporates BHPP results from acquisition date. The merger is expected to create opportunities to realise ongoing synergies.\n\nDue to the size, complexity and timing of the transaction, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured on a provisional basis. As at 31 December 2022, the Allocable Cost Amount (ACA) tax valuation process has been substantially completed with potential adjustments if new information is obtained within 12 months from the acquisition date about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Adjustments will be made to the provisional amounts recognised including the value of goodwill.\n\nThe merged Group's financial results could be adversely a/ffected by impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets, the application of future accounting policies or interpretations of existing accounting policies including by regulatory direction, and changes in estimates of decommissioning costs. Details and risks have been included in the Merger Explanatory Memorandum released on 8 April 2022.\n\nGiven the purchase consideration was agreed on 22 November 2021 based on a fixed number of shares, the final value of consideration paid was subject to fluctuations in share price until completion on 1 June 2022. This has resulted in a material goodwill number which will be subject to impairment in future, for example should commodity prices decrease.\n\nDetails of the purchase consideration and the provisional fair value of goodwill, identifiable assets and liabilities of BHPP acquired are as follows:\n\n## Provisional fair value of net identifiable assets and goodwill arising on acquisition date\n\n|                                                   | US$m    |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                         | 399     |\n| Receivables                                       | 1,164   |\n| Inventories                                       | 295     |\n| Investments accounted for using the equity method | 267     |\n| Other financial assets                            | 59      |\n| Other assets                                      | 114     |\n| Exploration and evaluation assets                 | 180     |\n| Oil and gas properties                            | 19,353  |\n| Lease assets                                      | 142     |\n| Payables                                          | (910)   |\n| Provisions                                        | (4,804) |\n| Tax payable                                       | (365)   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                          | (576)   |\n| Lease liabilities                                 | (268)   |\n| Other liabilities                                 | (1,054) |\n| Net identifiable assets acquired                  | 13,996  |\n| Goodwill arising on acquisition                   | 4,614   |\n| Purchase consideration                            | 18,610  |\n\n| Purchase consideration                          | US$m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Shares issued, at fair value                    | 19,265 |\n| Other reserves (share replacement awards)       | 18     |\n| Provisional locked box payment received/one.num | (683)  |\n| Adjustments to locked box payment               | 10     |\n| Total purchase consideration                    | 18,610 |\n\n| Analysis of cash flows on acquisition                                                                        | US$m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cash acquired on acquisition                                                                                 | 399    |\n| Provisional locked box payment received                                                                      | 683    |\n| Net cash flow on acquisition (included in the consolidated  statement of cash flows as investing activities) | 1,082  |\n\nAcquisition-related costs of $419 million that were not directly attributable to the issue of shares are included as an expense in general, administration and other costs in the consolidated income statement. $357 million has been paid and included in the consolidated statement of cash flows as operating activities.

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## B.5    Business comination (cont.)\n\n## Provisional locked box payment received\n\nThe Group received $683 million as part of the merger consideration which includes the locked box payment of $1,513 million representing the positive net cash flow generated by BHPP assets from the e/ffective date of the transaction to completion date o/ffset by the notional dividend distribution of $830 million paid to BHP.\n\nThe $683 million of provisional locked box payment received and the $399 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired as part of the merger have been included within investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n## Revenue and contribution to the Group\n\nThe acquired business contributed operating revenue of $4,653 million and profit before tax of $2,042 million to the Group from the acquisition date to 31 December 2022. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2022, consolidated operating revenue and profit before tax would have been higher by $3,115 million and $1,265 million respectively.\n\n## Acquired receivables\n\nThe fair value of receivables approximates the gross amount of trade receivables. None of the receivables have been impaired and the full contractual amounts are expected to be collected.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nThe Group recognised contingent liabilities of $79 million within other liabilities. This is based on the Group's assessment of the fair value of contingent liabilities acquired on acquisition, taking into account a range of possible outcomes.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, there have been no changes to the amount recognised on acquisition date.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition has been recognised as the excess of consideration paid above the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination. $1,958 million of the goodwill arises from the deferred tax liability recognised on acquisition as a consequence of asset tax bases received in the merger being lower than the fair value of the assets acquired. The remaining goodwill of $2,656 million reflects the value expected to be generated from the Pluto-Scarborough CGU as a result of the merger. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's CGUs or groups of CGUs no larger than an operating segment that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nGoodwill is not amortised but will be assessed at least annually for impairment and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.\n\n## Share replacement awards\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the SSA, the Group exchanged equity-settled share-based payment awards held by employees of BHPP for equity-settled share-based payment awards of Woodside. The replacement awards are based on service conditions with a vesting date of 31 August 2023 and 31 August 2024. The fair value of the replacement awards on acquisition is $49 million based on a forfeiture rate of 3%. $18 million has been included as part of the purchase consideration and the remaining amount will be recognised as post-acquisition compensation cost.\n\n## Business combination accounting\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, including business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control, regardless of whether equity instruments are issued or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Where equity instruments are issued in an acquisition, the fair value of the instruments is their published market price as at the date of exchange.\n\nTransaction costs arising on the issue of equity instruments are recognised directly in equity. Transaction costs that were not directly attributable to the issue of shares are expensed as incurred.\n\nContractual assets and liabilities in respect of sales agreements are recognised at fair value.\n\nRestoration provisions are recognised on acquisition at fair value.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Fair value determination for net assets acquired\n\nJudgement is required to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, which can have a material impact on resultant goodwill. This includes the use of a cash flow model to estimate the expected future cash flows of the oil and gas assets acquired, based on reserves and resources at acquisition date and the discount rate used. The expected future cash flows are based on estimates of future production, commodity and carbon prices, operating costs, and forecast capital expenditures at acquisition date.\n\nRestoration provisions require judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations and the extent of restoration activities required in determining the cost estimate.\n\nCarry forward tax losses are recognised only if it is probable that su/fficient future taxable income will be available to utilise the losses.\n\n## (b) Goodwill allocation\n\nJudgement is required in the allocation of goodwill to the Group's CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Refer to Note B.4 for the details of the goodwill allocation.\n\nW",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## B.6  Significant production and growth asset acquisitions\n\n## (a) Sangomar - Acquisition from FAR Senegal RSSD SA\n\nOn 7 July 2021, Woodside completed the acquisition of FAR Senegal RSSD SA's interest in the RSSD Joint Venture (13.67% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area and 15% interest in the remaining RSSD evaluation area), for an aggregate purchase price of $212 million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n\nAdditional payments of up to $55 million are contingent on future commodity prices and timing of first oil. The contingent payments terminate on the earliest of 31 December 2027, three years from first oil being sold, and a total contingent payment of $55 million being reached. The contingent payments are accounted for as contingent liabilities in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, Woodside held an 82% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area (2020: 68.33%) and a 90% interest in the remaining RSSD evaluation area (2020: 75%).\n\n## Assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of the acquisition inclusive of transaction costs are:\n\n|                                              | US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Oil and gas properties                       | 205    |\n| Exploration and evaluation                   | 7      |\n| Cash acquired                                | 3      |\n| Payables                                     | (13)   |\n| Net other assets and liabilities assumed     | 10     |\n| Total identifiable net assets at acquisition | 212    |\n\n## Cash flows on acquisition\n\n|                                  | US$m   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|\n| Purchase cash consideration      | 212    |\n| Transaction costs                | -      |\n| Total purchase consideration     | 212    |\n| Net cash outflows on acquisition | 212    |\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Nature of acquisition\n\nJudgement was required to determine if the transaction was the acquisition of an asset or a business combination. The Sangomar project was in the early phase of development and a substantive process that had the ability to convert inputs to outputs was not present and therefore the acquisition in 2021 was treated as asset acquisitions.\n\n## (b) Sangomar - Acquisition from Capricorn Senegal Limited\n\nOn 22 December 2020, Woodside completed the acquisition of Capricorn Senegal Limited's (Cairn's) interest in the RSSD Joint Venture (36.44% interest in the Sangomar exploitation area and 40% interest in the remaining RSSD evaluation area) for an aggregate purchase price of $527 million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.\n\nAdditional payments of up to $100 million are contingent on future commodity prices and the occurrence of first oil prior to 2025. The contingent payments are accounted for as contingent liabilities in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## Assets acquired and liabilities assumed\n\nThe identifiable assets and liabilities acquired as at the date of the acquisition inclusive of transaction costs were:\n\n|                                              | US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Oil and gas properties                       | 540    |\n| Exploration and evaluation                   | 26     |\n| Cash acquired                                | 5      |\n| Payables                                     | (51)   |\n| Net other assets and liabilities assumed     | 7      |\n| Total identifiable net assets at acquisition | 527    |\n\n## Cash flows on acquisition\n\n|                                  |   US$m |\n|----------------------------------|--------|\n| Purchase cash consideration      |    525 |\n| Transaction costs                |      2 |\n| Total purchase consideration     |    527 |\n| Net cash outflows on acquisition |    527 |",

Production and growth assets\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## B.7  Disposal of assets\n\n## Sell-down of Train 2\n\nOn 15 November 2021 the Group entered into a sale and purchase agreement with Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) for the sale of a 49% non-operating participating interest in the Pluto Train 2 Joint Venture.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group reclassified the carrying value of the 49% interest in the Pluto Train 2 assets to assets held for sale. There were no recognised liabilities associated with the assets held for sale.\n\nThe transaction completed on 18 January 2022, reducing the Group's participating interest from 100% to 51%. The Group recognised an initial pre-tax gain on sale of $427 million.\n\nThe arrangements require GIP to fund its 49% share of capital expenditure from 1 October 2021 and an additional amount of construction capital expenditure of $822 million on behalf of the Group. If the total capital expenditure incurred is less than $5,800 million, GIP will pay Woodside an additional amount equal to 49% of the under-spend. In the event of a cost overrun, Woodside will fund up to $822 million of GIP's share of the overrun. Delays to the expected start-up of production will result in payments by Woodside to GIP in certain circumstances. The arrangements include provisions for GIP to be compensated for exposure to additional Scope 1 emissions liabilities above agreed baselines, and to sell its 49% interest back to Woodside if the status of key regulatory approvals materially changes.\n\nGiven judgement was used to determine the consideration received, the Group is required to remeasure the variable consideration at each reporting period. As at 31 December 2022, the variable consideration has been remeasured with a $71 million revaluation gain recognised as other income, with a corresponding reduction to other liabilities. The fair value of the remaining unpaid funding from GIP has been netted against the other liabilities and will be recognised as oil and gas properties in the future.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Sell-down of Train 2\n\nGiven the arrangements include provisions for GIP to sell its 49% interest back to Woodside if the status of key regulatory environmental approvals materially changes and the requirement for Woodside to fund up to $822 million of GIP's share in the event of a cost overrun, judgement is required to determine if the selldown of Train 2 constitutes a sale and if a portion of the transaction price should be considered a variable consideration.\n\nJudgement was used to determine that the sell-down of Train 2 constituted a sale given the various conditions included in the sale and purchase agreement. The Group determined that a sale occurred as control of the 49% interest was passed to GIP on completion date. Control is determined as the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, the associated interest.\n\nJudgement was used to determine if it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur in relation to the consideration received. The Group estimated the variable consideration based on the construction capital expenditure cost profile, the development schedule, and assessing the probability and impact of any event which may result in a significant reversal. The constraining estimates of variable consideration have been applied resulting in the initial pre-tax gain on sale of $427 million.\n\nThe variable consideration is remeasured at each reporting period with any changes recognised through the consolidated income statement. As at 31 December 2022, the variable consideration has been remeasured with a $71 million revaluation gain recognised as other income.\n\nW",

Debt and capital\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## In this section\n\nThis section addresses cash, debt and the capital position of the Group at the end of the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made.\n\n## C.

Capital management is undertaken to ensure that a secure, cost-e/ffective and flexible supply of funds is available to meet the Group's operating and capital expenditure requirements. A stable capital base is maintained from which the Group can pursue its growth aspirations, whilst maintaining a flexible capital structure that allows access to a range of debt and equity markets to both draw upon and repay capital.\n\nThe Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2003 for activation as required to fund future growth. The DRP was reactivated in 2019 and suspended by the Board of Directors on 27 February 2023.\n\nA range of financial metrics are monitored, including gearing and cash flow leverage, and Treasury policy breaches and exceptions.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the financial liabilities of the Group and the Group's subsequent ability to meet its obligations to repay financial liabilities as and when they fall due. The liquidity position of the Group is managed to ensure su/fficient liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments in a timely and cost-e/ffective manner.\n\nThe Group's liquidity is continually reviewed, including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintain appropriate liquidity levels. At 31 December 2022, the Group had a total of $10,239 million (2021: $6,125 million) of available undrawn facilities and cash at its disposal. The maturity profile of interest-bearing liabilities is disclosed in Note C.2, trade and other payables are disclosed in Note D.4 and lease liabilities are disclosed in Note D.7. Financing facilities available to the Group are disclosed in Note C.2.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the Group's financial position will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to financial instruments with floating interest rates including long-term debt obligations, cash and short-term deposits. The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt. To manage the ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt, the Group may enter into interest rate swaps. The Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk (refer to Section A) and interest rate risk of the CHF denominated medium term note. The Group also holds interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the $600 million syndicated facility. Refer to Notes C.2 and D.6 for further details.\n\nAt the reporting date, the Group was exposed to various benchmark interest rates that were not designated in cash flow hedges, primarily through $6,143 million (2021: $2,962 million) on cash and cash equivalents, $83 million (2021: $367 million) on interestbearing liabilities (excluding transaction costs), $167 million of other financial assets (2021: nil) and $5 million (2021: $9 million) on cross-currency interest rate swaps.\n\nA reasonably possible change in the USD London Interbank O/ffered Rate (USD LIBOR) (+1.5%/-1.5% (2021: +1.0%/-1.0%)), with all variables held constant, would not have a material impact on the Group's equity or the income statement in the current period.\n\nThe transition of a number of the Group's financial liabilities from USD LIBOR to SOFR during the year ended 31 December 2022 did not result in a material impact to the Group. The Group's Treasury function continues to execute the transition of the remaining financial instruments from current benchmark rates to alternative benchmark rates.",

Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Any di/fference between the proceeds received and the redemption amount is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nBorrowings designated as a hedged item are measured at amortised cost adjusted to record changes in the fair value of risks that are being hedged in fair value hedges. The changes in\n\nthe fair value risks of the hedged item resulted in a gain of $7 million being recorded (2021: gain of $5 million), and a loss of $7 million recorded on the hedging instrument (2021: loss of $7 million).\n\nAll bonds, notes and facilities are subject to various covenants and negative pledges restricting future secured borrowings, subject to a number of permitted lien exceptions. Neither the covenants nor the negative pledges have been breached at any time during the reporting period.\n\nW",

Debt and capital\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## C.2   Interest-bearing liabilities and financing facilities (cont.)\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of interest-bearing liabilities approximates their fair value, with the exception of the Group's unsecured bonds and the medium term notes. The unsecured bonds have a carrying amount of $4,084 million (2021: $4,081 million) and a fair value of $3,852 million (2021: $4,443 million). The medium term notes have a carrying amount of $385 million (2021: $592 million) and a fair value of $372 million (2021: $604 million). Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date and classified as Level 1 on the fair value hierarchy. Where these cash flows are in a foreign currency, the present value is converted to US dollars at the foreign exchange spot rate prevailing at the reporting date. The Group's repayment obligations remain unchanged.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAll interest-bearing liabilities are denominated in US dollars, excluding the CHF175 million medium term note.\n\n## Maturity profile of interest-bearing liabilities\n\nThe table below presents the contractual undiscounted cash flows associated with the Group's interest-bearing liabilities, representing principal and interest. The figures will not necessarily reconcile with the amounts disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n|                     | 2022 US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Due for payment in: |             |             |\n| 1 year or less      | 483         | 470         |\n| 1-2 years           | 206         | 462         |\n| 2-3 years           | 1,181       | 188         |\n| 3-4 years           | 962         | 1,169       |\n| 4-5 years           | 908         | 951         |\n| More than 5 years   | 2,416       | 3,320       |\n|                     | 6,156       | 6,560       |\n\nAmounts exclude transaction costs.\n\n## Bilateral facilities\n\nThe Group has 14 bilateral loan facilities totalling $2,050 million (2021: 14 bilateral loan facilities totalling $1,900 million). Details of bilateral loan facilities at the reporting date are as follows:\n\n|   Number of  facilities | Term (years)    | Currency   | Extension option   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------|\n|                       1 | 5 - 6           | US$        | Evergreen          |\n|                       5 | 4 - 5           | US$        | Evergreen          |\n|                       4 | 3 - 4           | US$        | Evergreen          |\n|                       4 | 3 years or less | US$        | Evergreen          |\n\nInterest rates are based on USD LIBOR or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and margins are fixed at the commencement of the drawdown period. Interest is paid at the end of the drawdown period. Evergreen facilities may be extended continually by a year subject to the bank's agreement.\n\n## Syndicated facility\n\nDuring the period, Woodside refinanced and increased the existing facilities to $2,000 million, with $800 million expiring on 11 October 2024, $600 million expiring on 12 July 2025 and $600 million expiring on 12 July 2027. Interest rates are based on SOFR and margins are fixed at the commencement of the drawdown period.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Group completed a $600 million syndicated facility with a term of seven years. Interest is based on the USD LIBOR plus 1.2%. Interest is paid on a quarterly basis.\n\n## Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) facility\n\nOn 24 June 2008, the Group entered into a two tranche committed loan facility of $1,000 million and $500 million respectively. The $500 million tranche was repaid in 2013. There is a prepayment option for the remaining balance. Interest rates are based on USD LIBOR. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears and the principal amortises on a straight-line basis, with equal instalments of principal due on each interest payment date (every six months).\n\nUnder this facility, 90% of the receivables from designated Pluto LNG sale and purchase agreements are secured in favour of the lenders through a trust structure, with a required reserve amount of $30 million.\n\nTo the extent that this reserve amount remains fully funded and no default notice or acceleration notice has been given, the revenue from Pluto LNG continues to flow directly to the Group from the trust account.\n\n## Medium term notes\n\nOn 28 August 2015, the Group established a $3,000 million Global Medium Term Notes Programme listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Two notes have been issued under this programme as set out below:\n\n| Maturity date    | Currency   |   Carrying amount  (million) | Nominal interest  rate   |\n|------------------|------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 11 December 2023 | CHF        |                          185 | 1.00%                    |\n| 29 January 2027  | US$        |                          200 | 3.07%                    |\n\n## US bonds\n\nThe Group has four unsecured bonds issued in the United States of America as defined in Rule 144A of the US Securities Act of 1933 as set out below:\n\n| Maturity date     | Carrying amount  US$m   | Nominal interest  rate   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 5 March 2025      | 1,000                   | 3.65%                    |\n| 15 September 2026 | 800                     | 3.70%                    |\n| 15 March 2028     | 800                     | 3.70%                    |\n| 4 March 2029      | 1,500                   | 4.50%                    |\n\nInterest on the bonds is payable semi-annually in arrears.\n\nDuring the period, the Group repaid $200 million of the Yucho 2022 Medium Term Note and $83 million on the JBIC facility.",

No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## (a) Issued and fully paid shares\n\n|                                                                                        | Number of  shares   | US$m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------|\n| Year ended 31 December 2022                                                            |                     |        |\n| Opening balance                                                                        | 969,631,826         | 9,409  |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at  US$23.14 (2021 final dividend)/one.num                | 14,348,997          | 332    |\n| Ordinary shares issued at US$21.06 for  the acquisition of BHPP/two.num                | 914,768,948         | 19,265 |\n| Transaction costs associated to the  issue of shares                                   | -                   | (5)    |\n| Amounts as at 31 December 2022                                                         | 1,898,749,771       | 29,001 |\n| Year ended 31 December 2021                                                            |                     |        |\n| Opening balance                                                                        | 962,225,814         | 9,297  |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at  US$19.03 (2020 final dividend)                        | 1,354,072           | 26     |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at  US$14.21 (2021 interim dividend)                      | 6,051,940           | 86     |\n| Amounts as at 31 December 2021                                                         | 969,631,826         | 9,409  |\n| Year ended 31 December 2020                                                            |                     |        |\n| Opening balance                                                                        | 942,286,900         | 9,010  |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at  A$25.61 (2019 final dividend)                         | 12,072,034          | 181    |\n| DRP - ordinary shares issued at  A$18.79 (2020 interim dividend)                       | 6,091,035           | 83     |\n| Employee share plan - ordinary  shares issued at A$18.27   (2017 Woodside equity plan) | 1,775,845           | 23     |\n| Amounts as at 31 December 2020                                                         | 962,225,814         | 9,297  |\n\nAll shares are a single class with equal rights to dividends, capital, distributions and voting.

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## In this section\n\nThis section addresses the other assets and liabilities position at the end of the reporting period including, where applicable, the accounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made.\n\n## D.

Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Group, which comprise trade and other receivables, loans receivables and deposits with banks and financial institutions.\n\nThe Group manages its credit risk on trade receivables and financial instruments by predominantly dealing with counterparties with an investment grade credit rating. Su/fficient collateral is obtained to mitigate the risk of financial loss when transacting with counterparties with below investment grade credit ratings. Customers who wish to trade on unsecured credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures. Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis. As a result, the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's maximum credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of its financial assets.\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed by the Treasury function subject to the Group's established policy, procedures and controls relating to customer credit risk management. Credit quality of a customer is assessed based on an extensive credit rating scorecard and individual credit limits are defined in accordance with this assessment. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. At 31 December 2022, the Group had nineteen customers (2021: four customers) that owed the Group more than $10 million each and accounted for approximately 79% (2021: 88%) of all trade receivables. Depending on the product, settlement terms are 8 to 30 days from the date of invoice or bill of lading unless otherwise stated in the agreed payment terms.\n\nThe Group considers the probability of default upon initial recognition of the asset and whether there has been a significant depreciation in credit quality on an ongoing basis. A significant decrease in credit quality is defined as a debtor being greater than 30 days past due in making a contractual payment. Credit losses for trade receivables (including lease receivables) and contract assets are determined by applying the simplified approach and are measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected loss. Under the simplified approach, determination of the loss allowance provision and expected loss rate incorporates past experience and forwardlooking information, including the outlook for market demand and forward-looking interest rates. A default on other financial assets is considered to be when the counterparty fails to make contractual payments within 60 days of when they fall due.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had a provision for credit losses of nil (2021: nil). Subsequent to 31 December 2022, 99% (2021: 100%) of the trade receivables balance of $1,067 million (2021: $152 million) has been received.\n\nCredit risk from balances with banks is managed by the Treasury function in accordance with the Group's policy. The Group's main funds are placed as short-term deposits with reputable financial institutions with strong investment grade credit ratings. At 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group and financial instruments are spread amongst a number of financial institutions to minimise the risk of counterparty default. The maximum exposure to financial institution credit risk is represented by the sum of all cash deposits plus accrued interest, bank account balances and fair value of derivative assets. The Group's counterparty credit policy limits this exposure to commercial and investment banks, according to approved credit limits based on the counterparty's credit rating.",

Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value. Receivables that satisfy the contractual cash flow and business model tests are subsequently measured at amortised cost less an allowance for uncollectable amounts. Uncollectable amounts are determined using the expected loss impairment model. Collectability and impairment are assessed on a regular basis.\n\nSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written o/ff are credited against other expenses in the consolidated income statement. Certain receivables that do not satisfy the contractual cash flow and business model tests are subsequently measured at fair value (refer to Note D.6).\n\nThe Group's customers are required to pay in accordance with agreed payment terms. Depending on the product, settlement terms are 14 to 30 days from the date of invoice or bill of lading and customers regularly pay on time. There are no significant overdue trade receivables as at the end of the reporting period (2021: nil).\n\n## Fair value\n\nThe carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $174 million of receivables at 31 December 2022 (2021: $121 million) in currencies other than US dollars (predominantly Australian dollars).\n\n## Loans receivable\n\nOn 9 January 2020, Woodside Energy Finance (UK) Ltd entered into a secured loan agreement with Petrosen (the Senegal National Oil Company), to provide up to $450 million for the purpose of funding Sangomar project costs. The facility has a maximum term of 12 years and semi-annual repayments of the loan are due to commence at the earlier of 12 months after RFSU or 30 June 2025. The carrying amount of the loan receivable is $408 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: $335 million), which approximates its fair value. The remaining balance of loans receivable is due from non-controlling interests.\n\n## D.3  Inventories\n\n|                                | 2022 US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (a) Inventories (current)      |             |             |\n| Petroleum products             |             |             |\n| Goods in transit               | 95          | 35          |\n| Finished stocks                | 103         | 34          |\n| Warehouse stores and materials | 480         | 133         |\n|                                | 678         | 202         |\n| (b) Inventories (non-current)  |             |             |\n| Warehouse stores and materials | 11          | 19          |\n|                                | 11          | 19          |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nInventories include hydrocarbon stocks, consumable supplies and maintenance spares. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average basis and includes direct costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable production overheads where applicable. Inventories determined to be obsolete or damaged are written down to net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less selling costs.\n\nW",

The nature of restoration activities includes the removal of facilities, abandonment of wells and restoration of a/ffected areas. Restoration provisions are updated annually, with the corresponding movement recognised\n\nagainst the related exploration and evaluation assets or oil and gas properties or expensed for late life projects with no corresponding asset.\n\nOver time, the liability is increased for the change in the present value based on a pre-tax discount rate appropriate to the risks inherent in the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recorded as an accretion charge within finance costs. The carrying amount capitalised in oil and gas properties is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset (refer to Note B.3).\n\nCosts incurred that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not have a future economic benefit, are expensed.",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## D.5  Provisions (cont.)\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nProvision is made for employee benefits accumulated as a result of employees rendering services up to the end of the reporting period. These benefits include wages, salaries, annual leave and long service leave.\n\nLiabilities in respect of employees' services rendered that are not expected to be wholly settled within one year after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services are recognised as long-term employee benefits.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Restoration obligations\n\nThe Group estimates the future decommissioning and remediation costs of o/ffshore oil and gas platforms, o/ffshore and onshore production facilities, wells and pipelines at di/fferent stages of the development and construction of assets or facilities. In many instances, decommissioning of assets occurs many years into the future.\n\nThe Group's restoration obligations are based on compliance with the requirements of relevant regulations which vary for di/fferent jurisdictions. For example Australian regulations require full removal for o/ffshore assets unless regulator approval is received to decommission in-situ. The Group maintains technical expertise to ensure that industry learnings, scientific research and local and international guidelines are reviewed in assessing its restoration obligations.\n\nThe restoration obligation requires judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, environmental legislation and regulations, the extent of restoration activities required, the engineering methodology for estimating cost, technologies used in determining the decommissioning cost, and liability-specific discount rates to determine the present value of these cash flows.\n\nThe Group applies either the 'expected outcome' approach or 'expected value' approach in assessing the cost estimate, reflecting a di/fference in approach to cost estimation for heritage Woodside and heritage BHPP assets. Both approaches are supported by AASB 137/ IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets , produce reliable estimates and are widely used in practice. Heritage Woodside assets refer to assets held by the Group prior to the BHPP merger. Heritage BHPP assets refers to assets acquired from BHP but excludes the commonly held assets by both heritage entities.\n\n## Expected outcome approach\n\nThis approach is used for heritage Woodside assets, and those assets commonly held by both heritage entities. The following cost assumptions are applied:\n\n- \u00b7  for onshore assets, provision has been made for the removal of production facilities and above ground pipelines using current restoration standards and techniques and taking into account risks and uncertainties; and\n- \u00b7  for o/ffshore assets, provision has been made for the plug and abandonment of wells and the removal of o/ffshore platform topsides, floating production storage o/ffloading (FPSO) and some subsea infrastructure. It is currently the Group's assumption that in some regulatory jurisdictions and environments, certain pipelines and infrastructure, parts of o/ffshore platform substructures, and certain\n\nThese liabilities are measured at the present value of the estimated future cash outflow to the employees using the projected unit credit method. Liabilities expected to be wholly settled within one year after the end of the period in which the employees render the related services are classified as shortterm benefits and are measured at the amount due to be paid.\n\n## Onerous contract provision\n\nProvision is made for loss-making contracts at the present value of the lower of the net cost of fulfilling and the cost arising from failure to fulfill each contract.\n\nsubsea infrastructure are decommissioned in-situ where it can be demonstrated that this will deliver equal or better environmental outcomes than full removal and that regulatory approval is obtained where arrangements are satisfactory to the regulator.\n\n## Expected value approach\n\nThis approach is used for heritage BHPP assets (excluding those commonly held by both heritage entities).\n\nFor both onshore and o/ffshore assets, provision has been made taking into consideration a risked range of possible removal outcomes, including full removal of certain assets. Individual site provisions are an estimate of the expected value of future cash flows required to rehabilitate the relevant site using current restoration standards and techniques and taking into account risks and uncertainties. Individual site provisions are discounted to their present value using country specific discount rates aligned to the estimated timing of cash outflows.\n\n## Inherent uncertainties\n\nThe basis of the restoration obligation provision for assets with approved decommissioning plans or general directions issued by the regulator can di/ffer from the assumptions disclosed above. Whilst the provisions reflect the Group's best estimate based on current knowledge and information, further studies and detailed analysis of the restoration activities for individual assets will be performed near the end of their operational life and/or when detailed decommissioning plans are required to be submitted to the relevant regulatory authorities. Actual costs and cash outflows can materially di/ffer from the current estimate as a result of changes in regulations and their application, prices, analysis of site conditions, further studies, timing of restoration and changes in removal technology. These uncertainties may result in actual expenditure di/ffering from amounts included in the provision recognised as at 31 December 2022.\n\nA range of pre-tax discount rates between 3.4% and 4.7% (2021: 0.4% to 2.4%) has been applied. If the discount rates were decreased by 0.5% then the provision would be $316 million higher. If the cost estimates were increased by 10% then the provision would be $627 million higher. The proportion of the non-current balance not expected to be settled within 10 years is 54% (2021: 65%).\n\n## (b) Legal case outcomes\n\nProvisions for legal cases are measured at the present value of the amount expected to settle the claim. Management is required to use judgement when assessing the likely outcome of legal cases, estimating the risked amount and whether a provision or contingent liability should be recognised.\n\nW",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## D.5  Provisions (cont.)\n\n## (c) Onerous contracts\n\nThe onerous contract provision assessment requires management to make certain estimates regarding the unavoidable costs and the expected economic benefits from the contract. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can a/ffect the assumptions.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Corpus Christi contract is expected to return a positive value and on this basis the provision has been reversed to nil (2021: $214 million). Changes in assumptions predominantly relating to the narrowing of the spread between the sales price and purchase price could result in the contract becoming onerous in the future.\n\nAssumptions used to determine the present value as at 31 December 2022 are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7  Remaining contract term - 18 years.\n- \u00b7  Discount rate - a pre-tax, risk free US government bond rate of 4.10% (2021: 1.855%) has been applied.\n- \u00b7  LNG pricing - forecast sales and purchase prices are subject to a number of price markers. Price assumptions are based on the best information on the market available at measurement date and derived from short- and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources. The forecasted sales are linked to gas hub prices (Title Transfer Facility (TTF)) at which physical sales are expected to occur and incorporate known sales pricing information/one.num. The long-term gas sales price is estimated on the basis of the Group's Brent price forecast. The estimated purchase price is linked to US gas hub prices (Henry Hub (HH)) at which physical purchases are expected to occur. The nominal TTF, Brent oil prices and HH gas prices used at 31 December 2022 were:\n\n|                 |   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 | 2027          |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| TTF (US$/MMBtu) |   47.9 |   36.4 |   22.3 |    8.8 | 9.0           |\n| Brent (US$/bbl) |   87   |   78   |   74   |   76   | 77/two.sup    |\n| HH (US$/MMBtu)  |    6.1 |    4.7 |    4   |    4.1 | 4.2/three.num |\n\n## D.6  Other financial assets and liabilities\n\n|                                                                                                | 2022 US$m   | 2021 US$m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Other financial assets                                                                         |             |             |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through  profit and loss                                   |             |             |\n| Derivative financial instruments designated  as hedges                                         | 207         | 134         |\n| Other financial assets                                                                         | 22          | 293         |\n| Financial instruments at amortised cost                                                        |             |             |\n| Hedge collateral (including interest)                                                          | 509         | -           |\n| Other financial assets                                                                         | 30          | -           |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through  other comprehensive income Other financial assets | 29          | -           |\n| Total other financial assets                                                                   | 797         | 427         |\n| Current                                                                                        | 677         | 320         |\n| Non-current                                                                                    | 120         | 107         |\n| Net carrying amount                                                                            | 797         | 427         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                                                    |             |             |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through  profit and loss                                   |             |             |\n| Derivative financial instruments designated  as hedges                                         | 721         | 563         |\n| Other financial liabilities                                                                    | -           | 9           |\n| Total other financial liabilities                                                              | 721         | 572         |\n| Current                                                                                        | 654         | 411         |\n| Non-current                                                                                    | 67          | 161         |\n| Net carrying amount                                                                            | 721         | 572         |\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Other financial assets and liabilities\n\nReceivables subject to provisional pricing adjustments are initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently measured at fair value with movements recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments that are designated within qualifying hedge relationships are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into. For relationships designated as fair value hedges, subsequent fair value movements of the derivative are recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nFor relationships designated as cash flow hedges, subsequent fair value movements of the derivative for the e/ffective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity; fair value movements for the ine/ffective portion are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Costs of hedging have been separated from the hedging arrangements and deferred to other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the periods when the hedged item a/ffects profit or loss.",

Other assets and liabilities\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## D.6  Other financial assets and liabilities (cont.)\n\n## Derivative financial instruments  (cont.)\n\nHedge e/ffectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective e/ffectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged exposure and the hedging instrument. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship has been, and is expected to be, e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged exposure using the hypothetical derivative method.\n\nIne/ffectiveness is recognised where the cumulative change in the designated component value of the hedging instrument on an absolute basis exceeds the change in value of the hedged exposure attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nIne/ffectiveness may arise where the timing of the transaction changes from what was originally estimated such as delayed shipments or changes in timing of forecast sales. This may also arise where the commodity swap pricing terms do not perfectly match the pricing terms of the LNG revenue contracts.\n\n## Fair value\n\nExcept for the other financial assets and other financial liabilities set out in this note, there are no material financial assets or financial liabilities carried at fair value.\n\nThe fair value of commodity derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable quoted forward pricing and swap models and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models that use present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity.\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms of maturity of each contract, using market interest rates for a similar instrument at the reporting date and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the reporting date and present value calculations based on high credit quality yield curves in the respective currencies and is classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of other financial assets and other financial liabilities are predominantly determined based on observable quoted forward pricing and are predominantly classified as Level 2 on the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nThe derivative financial instruments include foreign exchange forward contracts that are denominated in Australian dollars. The Group had no material other financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars.\n\n## Hedging activities\n\nDuring the period, the following hedging activities were undertaken:\n\n- \u00b7  The Group hedged a percentage of its oil-linked exposure, entering into oil swap derivatives settling in 2023 in order to achieve a minimum average sales price of $75 per barrel.\n- \u00b7  The Group entered into additional separate HH commodity swaps to hedge the purchase leg of the Corpus Christi volumes and separate TTF commodity swaps to hedge the sales leg of Corpus Christi volumes to mitigate pricing risk for 2023 to 2024.\n- \u00b7  As a result of hedging activities, approximately 49% of Corpus Christi volumes included in stock in transit for 2022, approximately 82% of 2023 volumes and approximately 29% of 2024 volumes have hedged pricing risk.\n- \u00b7  The Group restruck $150 million of the TTF hedges to reduce the derivative financial liability.\n- \u00b7  The Group restruck $92 million of the oil swap hedges to reduce the derivative financial liability. Further, the Group also voluntarily placed $506 million as collateral against the oil hedge positions to reduce counterparty credit risk exposure. The collateral will mature in line with hedge settlements in 2023.\n- \u00b7  Through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts, the Group hedged its Australian dollar to US dollar exchange rate in relation to a portion of the Australian dollar denominated capital expenditure expected to be incurred under the Scarborough development.\n\nW",

The Group has exposures to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be impacted as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group's main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is USD LIBOR. In 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that the three-month and six-month LIBOR will be phased out and eventually replaced by June 2023.\n\nDuring the period, the Group has transitioned a number of financial liabilities from USD LIBOR to SOFR and is in the process of transitioning the remaining financial instruments to alternative benchmark rates. The Group has financial liabilities and financial assets with a total carrying value of $670 million (2021: $957 million) and $393 million (2021: $367 million) respectively, which reference USD LIBOR.\n\nThe Group has the following hedging relationships which are exposed to interest rate benchmarks impacted by IBOR Reform:\n\n- \u00b7  Interest rate swaps to hedge the LIBOR interest rate risk associated with the $600 million syndicated facility (refer to Note C.2). The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges, converting the variable interest into fixed interest US dollar debt, and mature in 2027.\n- \u00b7  A fixed rate 175 million Swiss Franc (CHF) denominated medium term note, which it hedges with cross-currency interest rate swaps designated in both fair value and cash flow hedge relationships. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are referenced to LIBOR (refer to Note C.2).\n\nThe transition of a number of the Group's financial liabilities from USD LIBOR to SOFR during the year ended 31 December 2022 did not result in a material impact to the Group. The Group's Treasury function continues to execute the transition of the remaining financial instruments from current benchmark rates to alternative benchmark rates.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair value of other financial assets and liabilities\n\nEstimates have been applied in the measurement of other financial assets and liabilities and, where required, judgement is applied in the settlement of any financial assets or liabilities. In the current period, this included a $3 million periodic adjustment relating to timing which increased other financial liabilities, reflecting the arrangements governing Wheatstone LNG sales (2021: $56 million increase).",

A lease arises when the Group has the right to direct the use of an identified asset which is not substitutable and to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use. The leases recognised by the Group predominantly relate to LNG vessels, property and drilling rigs.\n\nThe Group separates the lease and non-lease components of the contract and accounts for these separately. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each component on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices.\n\n## Leases as a lessee\n\nLease assets and lease liabilities are recognised at the lease commencement date, which is when the assets are available for use. The assets are initially measured at cost, which is the present value of future lease payments adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any make-good obligations and initial direct costs incurred.\n\nLease assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their useful life and the lease term. Refer to Note B.3 for the useful lives of assets. Periodic adjustments are made for any re-measurements of the lease assets and for impairment losses, assessed in accordance with the Group's impairment policies.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of future minimum lease payments, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest rate. Minimum lease payments are fixed payments or index-based variable payments incorporating the Group's expectations of extension options and do not include non-lease components of a contract. A portfolio approach was taken when determining the implicit discount rate for LNG vessels with similar terms and conditions on transition.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there are changes in future lease payments arising from a change in rates, index or lease terms from exercising an extension or termination option. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the lease assets, with any excess recognised in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThere are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low value\n\nShort-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets are recognised as incurred as an expense in the consolidated income statement. Low value assets comprise plant and equipment.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nThe Group held $441 million of lease liabilities at 31 December 2022 (2021: $476 million) in currencies other than the US dollar (predominantly Australian dollars).\n\nW",

Total payments for leases in the consolidated statement of cash flows are $525 million (2021: $330 million), with $258 million (2021: $244 million) included in financing activities.\n\nThe Group has short-term and/or low value lease commitments for marine vessels and carriers, property, drill rigs and plant and equipment contracted for, but not provided for in the financial statements, of $60 million (2021: $53 million).\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## (a) Control\n\nJudgement is required to assess whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception by assessing whether the Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset and obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset.\n\n## (b) Lease term\n\nJudgement is required when assessing the term of the lease and whether to include optional extension and termination periods. Option periods are only included in determining the lease term at inception when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Lease terms are reassessed when a significant change in circumstances occurs. On this basis, possible additional lease payments amounting to $2,323 million (2021: $1,654 million) were not included in the measurement of lease liabilities.\n\n## (c) lnterest in joint arrangements\n\nJudgement is required to determine the Group's rights and obligations for lease contracts within joint operations, to assess whether lease liabilities are recognised gross (100%) or in proportion to the Group's participating interest in the joint operation. This includes an evaluation of whether the lease arrangement contains a sublease with the joint operation.\n\n## (d) Discount rates\n\nJudgement is required to determine the discount rate, where the discount rate is the Group's incremental borrowing rate if the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The incremental borrowing rate is determined with reference to the Group's borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification.",

Additionally, there are a number of other claims and possible claims that have arisen in the course of business against entities in the Group, the outcome of which cannot be estimated at present and for which no amounts have been included in the table above.\n\nThe Group has contingent assets of $199 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: nil).\n\n## E.2  Employee benefits\n\n|                                 |   2022 US$m |   2021 US$m |   2020 US$m |\n|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Employee benefits               |         415 |         217 |         252 |\n| Share-based payments            |          26 |          12 |          19 |\n| Defined contribution plan costs |          41 |          26 |          27 |\n| Defined benefit plan expense    |           9 |           1 |           2 |\n|                                 |         491 |         256 |         300 |\n\n## (a) Employee benefits\n\nEmployee benefits for the reporting period are as follows:\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nThe Group's accounting policy for employee benefits other than superannuation is set out in Note D.5. The policy relating to share-based payments is set out in Note E.2(c).\n\nAll employees of the Group are entitled to benefits on retirement, disability or death from the Group's retirement plans. The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. Employees entitled to defined contribution schemes receive fixed contributions from Group companies and the Group's legal or constructive obligation is limited to these contributions. Contributions to defined contribution funds are recognised as an expense as they become payable. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payment is available.\n\n## (b) Compensation of key management personnel\n\nKey management personnel (KMP) compensation for the financial year was as follows:\n\n|                                      | 2022 US$   | 2021 US$   | 2020 US$   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Short-term employee benefits/one.num | 5,730,340  | 6,626,354  | 5,868,476  |\n| Post-employment benefits/one.num     | 155,086    | 88,396     | 63,805     |\n| Share-based payments/two.num         | 3,114,043  | 5,697,529  | 7,201,653  |\n| Long-term employee benefits          | 4,300      | 717,223    | 515,585    |\n| Termination benefits                 | 152,531    | 2,447,525  | 390,087    |\n|                                      | 9,156,300  | 15,577,027 | 14,039,606 |\n\n## (c) Share plans\n\nThe Group provides benefits to its employees (including KMP) in the form of share-based payments whereby employees render services for shares (equity-settled transactions).\n\n## Woodside equity plan (WEP) and supplementary Woodside equity plan (SWEP)\n\nThe WEP is available to all permanent employees, but since 1 January 2018 has excluded Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS) participants. The number of Equity Rights (ERs) o/ffered to each eligible employee is determined by the Board, and based on individual performance as assessed under the performance review process. The linking of performance to an allocation allows the Group to recognise and reward eligible employees for high performance. The ERs have no further ongoing performance conditions after allocation, and do not require participants to make any payment in respect of the ERs at grant or at vesting. Each ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date three years after the grant date.\n\nFor awards made in 2022, the Board amended the terms of the plan to entitle participants to receive a Woodside share on the vesting date, three years after the grant date. Awards made in 2020 and 2021 will vest under the terms of the plan at that time, which provided for 75% vesting of the ERs three years after the grant date and the remaining 25% of the ERs five years after the grant date.\n\nIn October 2011, the Board approved the establishment of the SWEP to enable the o/ffering of targeting retention awards of ERs for key capability. The SWEP was updated in 2022 to broaden eligibility to all employees of a subsidiary of Woodside Energy Group Ltd and ensure compliance in all jurisdictions in which Woodside operates. This facilitated the o/ffer of replacement unvested incentives, as required under transitional arrangements for eligible heritage BHP employees transitioning from BHP Group Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plans to VAR o/ffered under Woodside's VAR arrangements.",

Other items\n\nfor the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## E.2  Employee benefits (cont.)\n\n## Woodside equity plan (WEP) and supplementary Woodside equity plan (SWEP) (cont.)\n\nEach ER entitles the participant to receive a Woodside share or an American Depositary share on the vesting date either one, two, three or four years after the e/ffective grant date, depending on the individual details of each SWEP o/ffered. Participants do not make any payment in respect of the ERs at grant or at vesting.\n\n## Executive Incentive Plans (EIP)\n\nThe EIP operated as Woodside's Executive incentive framework until the end of 2017, after which the Board introduced the EIS. The EIP was used to deliver Short-Term Awards (STAs) and Long-Term Awards (LTAs) to Senior Executives.\n\n## Short-Term Awards (STAs)\n\nSTAs were delivered in the form of restricted shares to Executives, including all Executive KMP. There are no further performance conditions for vesting of deferred STAs. Participants are not required to make any payments in respect of STA awards at grant or at vesting. Restricted shares entitle their holders to receive dividends.\n\n## Long-Term Awards (LTAs)\n\nLTAs were granted in the form of Performance Rights (PRs) to Executives, including all Executive KMP. Vesting of LTAs is subject to achievement of relative total shareholder return (RTSR) targets, with 33% measured against the ASX 50 and the remaining 67% tested against an international group of oil and gas companies. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends and are not required to make any payments in respect of LTA awards at grant or at vesting.\n\n## Executive Incentive Scheme (EIS)\n\nThe EIS was introduced for the 2018 performance year for all Executives including Executive KMP. The EIS is delivered in the form of a cash incentive, Restricted Shares and Performance Rights. The grant date of the Restricted Shares and Performance Rights has been determined to be subsequent to the performance year, being the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Accordingly, the 2021 Restricted Shares and Performance Rights were granted on 16 February 2022 for Executives and 19 May 2022 for the CEO and have been included in the table below. The expense estimated as at 31 December 2021 in relation to the 2021 performance year was updated to the fair value on grant date during the period.\n\nThe 2022 Restricted Shares and Performance Rights have not been included in the table below as they have not been approved as at 31 December 2022. An expense related to the 2022 performance year has been estimated for the Restricted Shares and Performance Rights, using fair value estimates based on inputs at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Performance Based Pay Plus (PBP Plus)\n\nPBP Plus is available to senior, permanent employees who are not Executives. Participants receive an annual award of cash and Restricted Shares based on corporate and individual performance, recognising and rewarding eligible employees for high performance.\n\nThe grant date of the Restricted Shares has been determined to be subsequent to the performance year, being the date of the Board of Directors' approval. Accordingly, the 2021 Restricted Shares were granted on 16 February 2022 and have been included in the table below. The expense estimated as at 31 December 2021 in relation to the 2021 performance year was updated to the fair value on grant date during the period.\n\nThe 2022 Restricted Shares have not been included in the table below as they have not been approved as at 31 December 2022. An expense related to the 2022 performance year has been estimated for the Restricted Shares, using fair value estimates based on inputs at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nAll compensation under WEP, SWEP and Executive share plans is accounted for as share-based payments to employees for services provided. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair values of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted. The fair value of share-based payments is recognised, together with the corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the vesting conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employee becomes fully entitled to the shares. At each balance sheet date, the Group reassesses the number of awards that are expected to vest based on service conditions. The expense recognised each year takes into account the most recent estimate.\n\nThe fair value of the benefit provided for the WEP and SWEP is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing technique.\n\nThe fair value of the restricted shares is estimated as the closing share price at grant date. The fair value of the benefit provided for the RTSR PRs is calculated using the Binomial or Black-Scholes option pricing technique combined with a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, where relevant, using historical volatility to estimate the volatility of the share price in the future.\n\nW",

Upstream LNG assets will continue to be depreciated over proved plus probable reserves. Multiproduct assets are assessed on a case-by-case basis and aligned to the most appropriate representation of useful life.\n\nThe indicative impact to depreciation expense in 2023 resulting from the change in estimate is expected to be an increase of approximately $600 million. This is an indicative amount and is based on current forecasts which are subject to assumptions and uncertainties.\n\n## E.6  Joint arrangements\n\n## (a) Interest percentage in joint ventures\n\n|                                                    |                                                                                                                                                      |   Group Interest % |   Group Interest % |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Entity                                             | Principal activity                                                                                                                                   |            2022    |            2021    |\n| North West Shelf Gas Pty  Ltd                      | Contract administration  services for venturers  for LNG sales to  Japan.

Judgement is applied when determining the relevant activities of a project and if joint control is held over it.\n\nRelevant activities include, but are not limited to, work program and budget approval, investment decision approval, voting rights in joint operating committees, amendments to permits and changes to joint arrangement participant holdings. Transactions which give Woodside control of a business are business combinations. If Woodside obtains joint control of an arrangement, judgement is also required to assess whether the arrangement is a joint operation or a joint venture. If Woodside has neither control nor joint control, it may be in a position to exercise significant influence over the entity, which is then accounted for as an associate.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nJoint arrangements are arrangements in which two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is the contractual agreed sharing of control of the arrangement which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Joint arrangements are classified as either a joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights and obligations arising from the contractual obligations between the parties to the arrangement.\n\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the individual assets and obligations arising from the joint arrangement, the arrangement is classified as a joint operation, and as such the Group recognises its:\n\n- \u00b7  assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;\n- \u00b7  liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;\n- \u00b7  revenue from the sale of its share of the output arising from the joint operation;\n- \u00b7  share of revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and\n- \u00b7  expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.\n\nTo the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the investment is classified as a joint venture and accounted for using the equity method.\n\nJoint arrangements acquired which are deemed to be carrying on a business are accounted for applying the principles of AASB 3/ IFRS 3 Business Combinations . Joint arrangements which are not deemed to be carrying on a business are treated as asset acquisitions.",

The members of the Australian tax consolidated group are identified in Note E.8(a).\n\nThe tax expense/benefit, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary di/fferences of the members of the tax consolidated group are recognised in the separate financial statements of the members of the tax consolidated group, using the stand-alone approach.\n\nEntities within the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax funding arrangement and a tax sharing agreement with the head entity. Under the tax funding agreement, Woodside Energy Group Ltd and each of the entities in the tax consolidated group have agreed to pay or receive a tax equivalent payment to or from the head entity, based on the current tax liability or current tax asset of the entity.\n\nThe tax sharing agreement entered into between members of the tax consolidated group provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities, should the head entity default on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.\n\n## US tax consolidation\n\nWoodside Energy USA Operations Inc and its wholly owned USA controlled entities have elected to file a consolidated tax return, with Woodside Energy USA Operations Inc as the parent of the tax consolidated group.\n\nThe tax expense/benefit, deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets arising from temporary di/fferences of the members of the tax consolidated group are computed on a separate company basis.\n\nEntities within the tax consolidated group have entered into a tax sharing agreement. Under the tax sharing agreement, the tax liability for the consolidated group or the utilisation of tax attributes are settled periodically between the members of the group. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.\n\n## (b) New and amended accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet e/ffective\n\nA number of new standards, amendments of standards and interpretations have recently been issued but are not yet e/ffective and have not been adopted by the Group as at the financial reporting date.\n\nThe Group has reviewed these standards and interpretations and has determined that none of the new or amended standards will significantly a/ffect the Group's accounting policies, financial position or performance.\n\n## (c) New and amended accounting standards and interpretations adopted\n\nAs of 1 January 2022, the Group adopted AASB 2020-3 Amendments to AASs - Annual Improvements 2018-2020 and Other Amendments including:\n\n- \u00b7  Amendments to AASB 3 Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n- \u00b7  Amendments to AASB 9 Fees in the '10 per cent' Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\n- \u00b7  Amendments to AASB 137 Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n\nThese amendments did not impact the financial statements of the Group.\n\nA number of other new standards are also e/ffective from 1 January 2022 but they do not have a material e/ffect on the Group's financial statements.",

Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of the Group, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Materiality\n\n## Audit scope\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- \u25cf For the purpose of our audit we used overall Group materiality of $459 million, which represents approximately 5% of the Group's profit before tax.\n- \u25cf We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.\n- \u25cf We chose Group profit before tax because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most commonly measured.\n- \u25cf We utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting it is within the range of commonly acceptable thresholds.\n- \u25cf Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, significant accounting estimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.\n- \u25cf The Group has major business units in Australia and the United States of America. In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by us, as the Group engagement team, and by component auditors under our instruction.\n- \u25cf Amongst other relevant topics, we communicated the following key audit matters to the Audit & Risk Committee:\n- -BHP Petroleum business combination - valuation of the fair value of net assets acquired.\n- -Allocation and carrying value of goodwill.\n- -Estimation of restoration provisions.\n- -Valuation of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) deferred tax assets (DTAs).\n- -Wheatstone CGU impairment reversal.\n- \u25cf These are further described in the Key audit matters section of our report.\n\nW",

The key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nBHP Petroleum business combination - valuation of the fair value of net assets acquired\n\nAs described in Note B.5 to the Group financial report, the Group completed the acquisition of BHP Petroleum for total purchase consideration of $18,610 million on 1 June 2022.\n\nThe acquisition method of accounting was used by the Group to account for this business combination, under which the fair value of net identifiable assets was provisionally estimated at acquisition date to be $13,996 million, giving rise to goodwill from the acquisition of $4,614 million.\n\nAs disclosed by the directors, estimating the fair value of net assets acquired requires the selection of appropriate valuation methodologies which include the use of cash flow models underpinned by significant estimates and assumptions. These significant estimates and assumptions include estimates of acquired oil and gas reserves and resources, estimates of future production and commodity prices, forecast operating costs and capital expenditures, discount rate assumptions, estimates of restoration obligations, assumptions relating to the Group's ability to utilise acquired tax losses, and estimates of carbon cost.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the fair value of net assets acquired as part of the BHP Petroleum business combination is a key audit matter are:\n\n- (i) there is a significant level of judgement applied by the Group in determining the fair value of net assets acquired including the use of cash flow models. The Group has also utilised experts to assist in the estimation of fair value,\n\nOur procedures included, among others:\n\n- (i) evaluating the Group's accounting for the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, the Share Sale Agreement and our understanding of the acquired net assets of BHP Petroleum,\n- (ii) assessing the methodology applied by the Group to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired at 1 June 2022, including assessing the appropriateness of significant estimates and assumptions,\n- (iii) evaluating the work of the Group's experts involved in the determination of significant assumptions and estimates,\n- (iv) evaluating the disclosures made regarding the business combination in the Group financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, and\n- (v) Professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Group's fair value estimates.",

At 31 December 2022, the Group conducted its annual goodwill impairment testing.\n\nPotential goodwill impairment is identified by the Group comparing an estimate of the recoverable amount of cash generating units ('CGUs') to their allocated carrying values, including goodwill, with recoverable amount estimated by reference to the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. Fair value is estimated using cash flow models, incorporating significant judgements and assumptions relating to oil and gas reserves and resources, estimates of future production and commodity prices, forecast operating costs and capital expenditures incorporating expected inflation and foreign exchange rates, discount rate assumptions, and estimates of carbon cost.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the assessment of goodwill impairment and allocation to CGUs is a key audit matter are:\n\n- (i) there is a significant level of judgement applied by the Group in determining which CGUs are expected to benefit from synergies from the business combination in order to allocate goodwill,\n- Our procedures included, among others:\n- (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology applied to allocate goodwill arising from the business combination to the Group's CGUs,\n- (ii) assessing the methodology applied by the Group to estimate the CGUs' fair values of assets and liabilities at 31 December 2022, including assessing the appropriateness of significant estimates and assumptions applied by the Group to estimate recoverable amounts,\n- (iii) evaluating the work of the Group's experts involved in the determination of significant assumptions and estimates,\n- (iv) evaluating the disclosures made regarding the goodwill recognised in the Group financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards, and\n- (v) Professionals with specialised skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Group's recoverable amount estimates when testing goodwill for impairment including certain significant assumptions.\n\nW",

The reserve estimates on which the Standard measure is based are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available or economic conditions change.\n\nDiscounted future net cash flows like those shown below are not intended to represent estimates of fair value. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in commodity prices, exchange rates, development and production costs as well as alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risk inherent in producing oil and gas.\n\n## Woodside standardised measure year ended 31 December\n\n|                            | Australia  US$m   | International  US$m   | Total  US$m   |\n|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| 2022                       |                   |                       |               |\n| Future cash inflows 1      | 197,194           | 38,256                | 235,450       |\n| Future production costs 1  | (31,157)          | (9,698)               | (40,855)      |\n| Future development costs 2 | (12,259)          | (4,487)               | (16,746)      |\n| Future income taxes        | (62,182)          | (4,823)               | (67,005)      |\n| Future net cash flows      | 91,596            | 19,248                | 110,844       |\n| Discount at 10% per annum  | (48,924)          | (7,777)               | (56,701)      |\n| Standardised measure       | 42,672            | 11,471                | 54,143        |\n| 2021                       |                   |                       |               |\n| Future cash inflows 1      | 76,202            | 5,695                 | 81,897        |\n| Future production costs 1  | (22,193)          | (899)                 | (23,092)      |\n| Future development costs 2 | (8,296)           | (2,481)               | (10,777)      |\n| Future income taxes        | (16,266)          | (90)                  | (16,356)      |\n| Future net cash flows      | 29,447            | 2,225                 | 31,672        |\n| Discount at 10% per annum  | (14,793)          | (1,142)               | (15,935)      |\n| Standardised measure       | 14,654            | 1,083                 | 15,737        |\n| 2020                       |                   |                       |               |\n| Future cash inflows 1      | 14,629            | -                     | 14,629        |\n| Future production costs 1  | (3,862)           | -                     | (3,862)       |\n| Future development costs 2 | (3,800)           | -                     | (3,800)       |\n| Future income taxes        | (1,023)           | -                     | (1,023)       |\n| Future net cash flows      | 5,944             | -                     | 5,944         |\n| Discount at 10% per annum  | (860)             | -                     | (860)         |\n| Standardised measure       | 5,084             | -                     | 5,084         |\n\n- 1.

Changes in reserves quantities are shown in section 3.9 - Reserves and Resources Statement.\n\n## Accounting for suspended exploratory well costs\n\nExpenditure on exploration and evaluation is accounted for in accordance with the area of interest method. Areas of interest are based on a geographical area for which the rights of tenure are current. All exploration and evaluation expenditure, including general permit activity, geological and geophysical costs and new venture activity costs, is expensed as incurred except for the following:\n\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure relates to an exploration discovery for which the assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable hydrocarbons is not yet complete; or\n- \u00b7  where the expenditure is expected to be recouped through successful exploitation of the area of interest, or alternatively, by its sale.\n\nThe costs of acquiring interests in new exploration and evaluation licences are capitalised. The costs of drilling exploration wells are initially capitalised pending the results of the well.\n\nCosts are expensed where the well does not result in the successful discovery of economically recoverable hydrocarbons and the recognition of an area of interest.\n\nSubsequent to the recognition of an area of interest, all further evaluation costs relating to that area of interest are capitalised.\n\nUpon approval for the commercial development of an area of interest, accumulated expenditure for the area of interest is transferred to oil and gas properties.\n\nIn the consolidated statement of cash flows, those cash flows associated with capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure, including unsuccessful wells, are classified as cash flows used in investing activities.",

Over the last three years, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility. Oil and gas prices hit record lows in 2020 as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic a/ffected world economies. In 2021 prices improved as economic activity increased. In 2022 gas prices hit record highs driven by years of underinvestment and the supply shock caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In 2022 there was a significant\n\nincrease in the scale of Woodside's production portfolio, with the completion of the merger with BHP's petroleum business on 1 June 2022.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nWoodside's revenue is exposed to commodity price fluctuations through the sale of hydrocarbons.

The increase was driven by the merger with BHP's petroleum business which completed on 1 June 2022, the Pluto-KGP interconnector, strong operational performance and higher realised prices across all products. Operating revenue increased by $3,362 million from 2020 to 2021, driven primarily by higher trading activity and higher average realised prices resulting from strengthening demand and an improvement in the trading environment.\n\nCost of sales increased by $2,695 million, or 70%, to $6,540 from 2021. The increase was driven by additional volumes as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business and the Pluto-KGP Interconnector, as well as higher costs related to Corpus Christi and Pluto cargoes. Cost of sales increased by $860 million from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to higher royalties and excise costs as a result of higher pricing and associated revenue.\n\nOther income increased by $596 million, or 429%, to $735 million from 2021, primarily due to a profit on the sell-down of Pluto Train 2. Other income increased by $175 million from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to income from Pluto volumes delivered into Wheatstone's sales commitment and net foreign exchange gains.\n\nOther expenses increased by $1,915 million, or 236%, to $2,726 million from 2021, primarily due to higher losses on hedging activities and repurchase agreements, and transaction and integration costs relating to the merger with BHP's petroleum business. The increased activity that comes with a larger, more diverse portfolio of assets has led to an increase in expenses associated to exploration activity and restoration movements. Other expenses increased $330 million from 2020 to 2021, driven by the Group's decision to exit Myanmar in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, an impairment reversal of $900 million was recognised for the Wheatstone asset, compared to an impairment reversal of $1,058 million in 2021.

        "page_content": "net finance costs decreased by $191 million, or 94%, from 2021, to $12 million. This was primarily due to higher interest income generated from higher interest rates and cash balances and a reduction in finance costs due to higher capitalised borrowing costs. net finance costs decreased $66 million from 2020 to 2021 as a result of a lower finance expense with the redemption of the 2021 US unsecured bond for $700 million and interest capitalised against qualifying assets; finance income was also lower due to a reduction in interest earned on US term deposits driven by lower interest rates and lower balances on deposit.\n\nTotal tax expense comprises income tax and petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT). Both income tax expense and PRRT expense increased from 2021 prior to the recognition of additional PRRT deferred tax assets. Higher realised prices in 2022 led to additional PRRT payments however also supported the recognition of additional Pluto deferred tax assets ($1,362 million) which has resulted in a 2022 net PRRT tax benefit. PRRT expense has therefore decreased from 2021 by $610 million, or 205%, to $313 million benefit due to the Pluto deferred tax asset recognition and the impairment reversal in 2021 not present in 2022. PRRT expense increased $736 million from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to the impact of the impairment reversal and the e/ffect of higher operating revenue.\n\nIncome tax increased by $1,955 million, or 204%, to $2,912 million. The increases are primarily related to higher profits due to higher prices and additional production. Income tax expense increased $1,983 million from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to higher taxable income from the e/ffect of higher revenue and impairment reversals.\n\n## Volumes, realised prices and operating revenues by product\n\nThe following describes movements in Woodside's operating revenues including a discussion of production volumes, sales volumes and realised prices for the years ending 31 December 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n|                          | Units   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Production volumes       |         |        |        |        |\n| LnG                      | MMboe   | 85.1   | 70.8   | 75.0   |\n| Pipeline gas             | MMboe   | 28.6   | 2.5    | 5.3    |\n| Crude oil and condensate | MMboe   | 38.7   | 1 7. 3 | 19.5   |\n| nGLs                     | MMboe   | 5.3    | 0.5    | 0.5    |\n| Total production         | MMboe   | 1 57.7 | 91.1   | 100.3  |\n| Sales volumes            |         |        |        |        |\n| LnG                      | MMboe   | 96.6   | 91.2   | 81.2   |\n| Pipeline gas             | MMboe   | 28.4   | 2.5    | 5.3    |\n| Crude oil and condensate | MMboe   | 39.3   | 1 7. 2 | 19.9   |\n| nGLs                     | MMboe   | 4.6    | 0.7    | 0.4    |\n| Total sales volumes      | MMboe   | 168.9  | 111.6  | 106.8  |\n\n|                           | Units   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average realised prices   |         |        |        |        |\n| LnG                       | $/boe   | 116.9  | 58.8   | 31.2   |\n| Pipeline gas              | $/boe   | 47.8   | 1 7. 0 | 13.9   |\n| Crude oil and condensate  | $/boe   | 95.8   | 76.4   | 42.4   |\n| nGLs                      | $/boe   | 44.4   | 82.4   | 44.3   |\n| Volume - weighted average | $/boe   | 98.4   | 60.7   | 32.4   |\n| Operating revenues        |         |        |        |        |\n| LnG                       | $m      | 11,289 | 5,359  | 2,519  |\n| Pipeline gas              | $m      | 1,362  | 43     | 73     |\n| Crude oil and condensate  | $m      | 3,758  | 1,316  | 843    |\n| nGLs                      | $m      | 206    | 60     | 16     |\n| Operating revenue         | $m      | 16,615 | 6,778  | 3,451  |\n\n## LNG\n\nRevenue from the sale of LnG increased by $5,930 million, or 111%, to $11,289 million for 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased volumes following the merger with BHP's petroleum business and the contribution of the Pluto-KGP interconnector during a period of higher average realised prices.\n\nRevenue from the sale of LnG increased by $2,840 million, or 113%, to $5,359 million for 2021, from 2020 due to an increase in average LnG realised price and additional volumes.\n\n## Pipeline gas\n\nRevenue from the sale of pipeline gas increased by $1,319 million, or 3,067%, to $1,362 million for 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased pipeline gas volumes as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business and higher average realised prices.\n\nRevenue from the sale of pipeline gas decreased by $30 million, or 41%, to $43 million for 2021, from 2020 primarily driven by the expiration of domestic gas contract obligations in June 2020. The average realised price for 2021 remained comparable to the average realised pipeline gas price in 2020.\n\n## Crude oil and condensate\n\nRevenue from the sale of crude oil and condensate increased by $2,442 million, or 186%, to $3,758 million for 2022 from 2021, due to increased crude oil and condensate volumes primarily as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business as well as higher average realised prices. Revenue from the sale of crude oil and condensate increased by $473 million, or 56%, to $1,316 million due to higher pricing, o/ffset by marginally lower production volumes.\n\n## NGLs\n\nRevenue from the sale of nGLs increased by $146 million, or 243%, to $206 million for 2022 from 2021, due to increased nGLs volumes as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business o/ffset by a decreased average realised price. Revenue from the sale of nGLs increased by $44 million, or 275%, to $60 million primarily due to increased prices.",

The increased cost of sales is driven by production and price-linked costs ($808 million) and increased depreciation ($777 million) primarily relating to acquired BHP assets.\n\nOperating revenue increased by $1,819 million in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to higher realised prices across all products and strong operational performance.\n\nProfit before tax and net finance costs increased by $6,871 million in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to increased revenue from higher realised prices, impairment losses recognised for various assets in 2020 not present in 2021 and impairment reversals for nWS Gas and Pluto-Scarborough recognised in 2021 not present in 2020.\n\n## Production\n\nThe Australia segment achieved an increase in production volumes of 45.5 MMboe in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to the merger with BHP's petroleum business and the Pluto-KGP Interconnector along with strong operational performance.\n\nProduction volumes for the Australia segment decreased by 9.2 MMboe in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the expiry of nWS joint domestic gas contract obligations, cessation of production from the Angel field in 2020, turnaround activity on nWS Project and Wheatstone and the impact of weather events in 2021.\n\n## International\n\nDetailed below is financial and operating information for our international operations comparing 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\n| Key metric                               |       | 2022   | 2021   | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Operating revenue                        | $m    | 1,570  | -      | -       |\n| Profit before tax and net  finance costs | $m    | 125    | (317)  | (1,315) |\n| Total production                         | MMboe | 21.1   | -      | -       |\n| Average realised prices                  |       |        |        |         |\n| Pipeline gas                             | $/boe | 49.0   | -      | -       |\n| Crude oil and condensate                 | $/boe | 88.7   | -      | -       |\n| natural gas liquids                      | $/boe | 31.3   | -      | -       |\n\n## Financial results\n\nOperating revenue of $1,570 million is due to the introduction of sales volumes as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business. For more information refer to note A.1 Segment revenue and expenses in section 5 - Financial Statements.\n\nProfit before tax and net finance costs of $125 million, has increased by $442 million, or 139%, from 2021 primarily due to increased operating revenue, o/ffset by increased cost of sales ($837 million) and other expenses ($297 million). Increased cost of sales is driven primarily by production and price-linked costs ($352 million) and depreciation ($439 million) as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business. The increased other expenses primarily relates to increased exploration and evaluation expenditure ($250 million) and increased restoration provision movements ($58 million), o/ffset by Myanmar write-o/ffs in 2021 not present in 2022 ($265 million).\n\nThere was no operating revenue reported in this segment for 2021 and 2020.",

Vacation students are included in relevant numbers where appropriate.\n- 2.  nPR stands for 'not previously reported'.\n\n## Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\n\nIn the normal course of business, Woodside is exposed to commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact Woodside's financial position and results of operations. Woodside's risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. Woodside uses derivative contracts to manage commodity price volatility, foreign exchange rate volatility on capital expenditure plans and interest rate exposure on financing activities.\n\nActual gains and losses in the future may di/ffer materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and Woodside's actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the e/ffectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.\n\n## Commodity price risk management\n\nWoodside's revenues are primarily derived from sales of LnG, crude oil, condensate, pipeline gas and nGLs. Consequently, Woodside's results of operations are strongly influenced by the prices it receives for these products, which in the case of oil\n\nand condensate are primarily determined by prevailing crude oil prices and in the case of pipeline gas, nGLs and LnG are primarily determined by prevailing crude oil prices as well as some fixed pricing and other price indexes (such as Henry Hub and the Japan Korea Marker). For the year ended 31 December 2022, the majority (approximately 75%) of Woodside's production was attributed to natural gas, comprising LnG, nGLs and pipeline gas and the remaining portion (approximately 25%) of Woodside's production was attributed to oil and condensate.\n\nLnG market conditions including, but not limited to, supply and demand, are unpredictable and are beyond Woodside's control. In particular, supply and demand for, and pricing of, LnG remain sensitive to energy prices, external economic and political factors, weather, climate conditions, natural disasters (including pandemics), timing of FIDs for new operations, construction and start up and operating costs for new LnG supply, buyer preferences for LnG, coal or crude oil and evolving buyer preferences for di/fferent LnG price regimes and the energy transition. Buyers and sellers of LnG are increasingly more flexible with the way they transact, and contracts may involve hybrid pricing that is linked to other indices such as the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent Crude deliverable futures contract (oil price) or the Japanese Crude Cocktail, which is the average price of customs-cleared crude oil imports into Japan as reported in customs statistics. Typically, only LnG supplied from the US was based on a component linked to movements in the US Henry Hub plus certain fixed and variable components. This type of pricing structure may become a component of the weighted average price into Asia and other markets since LnG supply and trade has globalised, and increasingly the lowest cost supply is setting the floor for long-term average global natural gas prices with transportation costs accounting for regional di/fferences. Tenders may also be used by suppliers and buyers, typically for shorter-term contracts. In addition, long-term LnG contracts typically contain price review mechanisms which sometimes need to be resolved by expert determination or arbitration. The use of these independent resolution mechanisms are likely to be more prevalent in volatile commodity markets. Alternatives to fossil fuel-based products for the generation of electricity, for example nuclear power and renewable energy sources, are continually under development and, if these alternatives continue to gain market share, they could also have a material impact on demand for LnG, which in turn may negatively impact Woodside's business, results of operations and financial condition in the longer-term.\n\nOil prices can be very volatile, and periods of sustained low prices could result in changes to Woodside's carrying value assumptions and may also reduce the reported net profit for the relevant period. The price of crude oil may be a/ffected by factors beyond Woodside's control, such as worldwide oil supply and",

Material adverse price impacts (including as a result of the energy transition) may a/ffect the economic performance (including as to margins and cash flows) of, and longevity of production from, Woodside's existing and future production assets, and ultimately the financial performance of Woodside.\n\nIt is impossible to predict future crude oil, LnG and natural gas price movements with certainty. A low crude oil price environment or declines in the price of crude oil, in LnG and natural gas prices, could adversely a/ffect Woodside's business, results of operations and financial condition and liquidity. They could also negatively impact its ability to access sources of capital, including equity and debt markets. Those circumstances may also adversely impact Woodside's ability to finance planned capital expenditures, including development projects, and may change the economics of operating certain wells, which could result in a reduction in the volume of Woodside's reserves. Declines in crude oil, LnG and natural gas prices, especially sustained declines, may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that it can produce economically, reduce the economic viability of planned projects or of assets that it plans to acquire or has acquired and may reduce the expected value and the potential commerciality of exploration and appraisal assets. Those reductions may result in substantial downward adjustments to Woodside's estimated proved reserves and require additional write-downs of the value of its oil and gas properties.\n\nSales contracts with the national Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago relating to production from Woodside's Trinidad and Tobago operations are linked to ammonia pricing. Similar to crude oil, LnG and natural gas, it is impossible to predict future ammonia prices with certainty.\n\nThere can be no assurance that Woodside will successfully manage its exposure to commodity prices. There is also\n\ncounterparty risk associated with derivative contracts. If any counterparty to Woodside's derivative instruments were to default or seek bankruptcy protection, it could subject a larger percentage of Woodside's future oil and gas production to price changes and could have a negative e/ffect on Woodside's financial performance, including its ability to fund future projects. Whether Woodside engages in hedging and other oil and gas derivative contracts on a limited basis or otherwise, Woodside will remain exposed to fluctuations in crude oil prices.\n\n## Foreign exchange and interest rate risk management\n\nRefer to sections A and C in section 5 - Financial Statements for further information on foreign exchange and interest rate risks.\n\n## Government regulations\n\nWoodside's assets and exploration, development, extraction and production operations are subject to a wide range of laws and regulations imposed by governments and regulatory bodies. These regulations touch all aspects of our assets, including how we extract, process and explore for oil and natural gas and how we conduct our business, including regulations governing matters such as environmental protection, land rehabilitation and facilities decommissioning, occupational health and safety, human rights, the rights and interests of First nations peoples, competition, foreign investment, export, marketing of oil and natural gas and taxes.\n\nThe ability to extract and process oil and natural gas is fundamental to our business. In most jurisdictions, the rights to explore for and extract petroleum deposits are owned by the government. We obtain the right to access the land and extract the product by entering into licences or leases with the government that owns the oil or natural gas deposit. Usually, the right to explore for oil and natural gas carries with it the obligation to spend a defined amount of money on the exploration, or to undertake particular exploration activities.\n\nWe also rely on governments to grant the rights necessary to transport and treat the extracted petroleum to prepare it for sale. The terms of the right, including the time period of the right, vary depending on the laws of the relevant government or terms negotiated with the relevant government.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions where we have assets, such as Trinidad and Tobago, and Senegal, a production sharing contract (PSC) governs the relationship between the government and companies (typically referred to as 'Contractor') concerning, among other things, how much of the oil and gas extracted from the country each party will receive. Under PSCs, the government awards exclusive rights for the execution of exploration, development and production activities to the Contractor in accordance with the PSC's terms. Generally speaking the Contractor bears the financial risk of the initiative to explore, develop and ultimately produce the field. When successful, the Contractor is permitted to use a certain set percentage of produced oil and gas to recover its capital and operational expenditures, often called 'cost oil.' The remaining production (often called 'profit oil') is split between the government and the",

PSCs are bilateral contracts negotiated between the Contractor and the government and so each is necessarily on di/fferent terms.\n\nApplicable laws and regulations and any permits that Woodside is required to obtain under these laws, may obligate Woodside to identify, avoid, mitigate and disclose environmental risks in various operational practices, including, among others, through pursuing and obtaining permits before commencing activities, restricting air and water emissions and waste discharges, limiting the type, quantity and concentration of various substances that can be utilised or released into the environment, addressing potential or actual impacts to protected species or cultural resources, monitoring or remediating contamination under certain circumstances, establishing and following certain inspection, testing and maintenance protocols, and disclosing certain operational practices. Moreover, environmental permits required for our operations may be subject to legal challenges by third parties, and such challenges can materially and adversely a/ffect our operations to the extent they delay or prevent obtaining approvals or permits required for our operations, or otherwise require incurring increased costs in order to obtain such approvals or permits. Applicable environmental laws and regulations may also dictate worker health and safety and community notification procedures.\n\nIn addition, from time to time, certain trade sanctions are adopted by the United nations (Un) Security Council and/ or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union (EU), China and Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals, that may restrict our ability to sell extracted minerals, oil or natural gas to, and/or our ability to purchase goods or services from, these countries, entities or individuals.\n\nThis summary focuses on the Australian and United States regulatory regimes. It is not a full summary of the regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions nor is it a complete list of the legislation and regulation that applies to Woodside. Woodside is also subject to environmental and other regulations to varying degrees in each of the jurisdictions in which it has assets and operations.\n\n## Australia\n\nIn Australia, petroleum exploration and development takes place within a legal framework characterised by a division of responsibilities between the federal and the state or territory governments. Exploration and development conducted onshore and within three nautical miles of the territorial sea baseline of the relevant state or territory are the responsibility of the individual state or territory governments. The Australian federal government has legislative responsibility for Australian o/ffshore petroleum exploration and production beyond the\n\nthree nautical mile territorial sea, which encompasses the area of most relevance to Woodside's o/ffshore activities. In addition, Woodside has certain onshore operations in Victoria and Western Australia which are subject to various state legislation.\n\n## Environmental regulation\n\nWoodside's Australian operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. For o/ffshore petroleum activities, these laws and regulations generally require the acquisition of an approval before any activity commences and require that for any activities, environmental risks are identified and controls put in place to reduce or eliminate the risks. For exploration drilling and seismic activities, this is outlined in an environment plan accepted by independent statutory authority; as an operation goes into construction, commissioning and production, a whole project proposal and revised environment plan is required to be submitted for approval. These laws and regulations also restrict the type, quantity and concentration of various substances that can be utilised or released into the environment in connection with marine and land-based activities; limit or prohibit drilling and seismic or production activities in and near certain environmentally sensitive or protected areas; and impose criminal and civil liabilities for pollution or other unauthorised impacts to the environment resulting from oil, natural gas and petrochemical operations.\n\nIn addition, Australian environmental laws and regulations also include restrictions on air emissions and water discharges resulting from the operation of drilling equipment, processing facilities, pipelines and transport vessels and require Woodside to periodically report on and manage greenhouse gas emissions. These laws also regulate the use, management and disposal of hazardous materials and general waste; prohibit the clearing of native vegetation without approval and protect Aboriginal heritage and biodiversity; and require Woodside to prepare and implement safety and environmental management plans. Woodside is required to provide bonds for any rehabilitation, clean-up or pollution prevention work that may be necessary as a result of the construction, decommissioning or removal of a pipeline and to report, monitor or remediate contamination under certain circumstances. Woodside is subject to 'strict liability' for oil spills, rendering it liable without regard to negligence or fault and may be subject to fines and other penalties for breaches of laws, regulations, licences or approvals.\n\nThe requirements imposed by environmental laws and regulations are subject to change and have tended to become stricter over time. The modification of existing foreign or domestic laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or development drilling for oil and gas for economic, political, social, environmental or other reasons could have a material adverse e/ffect on Woodside's business, financial condition or results of operations. There is ongoing and increasing public pressure on the government to accelerate its carbon emissions reduction program. At present, state and federal governments are developing carbon regimes designed to achieve net zero outcomes by 2050. As such, there",

        "page_content": "remains significant uncertainty regarding the future of climate change regulation in Australia and the e/ffect it may have on Woodside's business.\n\n## Fair Work Act amendments\n\nIn December 2022, the Australian federal government passed the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Act 2022 (Cth) (Act) . The Act amends the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the amendments will take e/ffect during the first half of 2023. In summary, the key changes being implemented through the Act are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  Agreements covering multiple employers: employers can be required to bargain for agreements that cover multiple employers. Employees are also able to take protected industrial action or seek bargaining orders in support of these agreements and there are limits on employers'/employees' ability to remove themselves as parties to them.\n- \u00b7  Bargaining disputes: broader powers for the Fair Work Commission to intervene and make workplace determinations (e/ffectively arbitrating an enterprise agreement) where bargaining is 'intractable'.\n- \u00b7  Industrial action: the removal of limitations on protected industrial action in relation to multi-enterprise agreements, but the inclusion of an obligation to attend Fair Work Commission mediation/conciliation before protected industrial action is taken (which applies to all forms of enterprise agreements except the 'cooperative' multi-enterprise stream where protected industrial action is not available).\n- \u00b7  Terminating agreements: reduced scope for termination of enterprise agreements, particularly during bargaining, and the sunsetting of 'zombie' agreements within 12 months of commencement (unless an extension is granted of up to 4 years).\n- \u00b7  Enterprise agreement approval process: bargaining may start when an employee bargaining representative gives notice in certain circumstances (and without a majority support determination), certain pre-approval requirements have been removed, the 'genuinely agreed' test has been retained, the 'better o/ff overall test' (BOOT) has been simplified and must involve a global (not line by line) assessment, the Fair Work Commission can amend an enterprise agreement during the approval process rather than relying on employer undertakings, and parties may apply for a reassessment of the BOOT during the life of the enterprise agreement (e.g. if employees' work patterns change).\n\n## Decommissioning liability amendments\n\nOn 2 September 2021, the Australian federal parliament passed the O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Titles Administration and Other Measures) Act 2021 (Cth) which, among other changes, amends the OPGGSA to impose new trailing liability and change of control provisions. The amendments took e/ffect from 2 March 2022. The changes to the trailing liability regime expand the existing powers of the national O/ffshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (nOPSEMA) and the Minister including\n\nthe ability to recall any former titleholder to undertake decommissioning activities on a title area. These powers are retrospective in their application and apply to titles that are currently in force as well as to titles that ceased to be in force on or after 1 January 2021.\n\nUnder the new change in control provisions, any change in control must be pre-approved by the national O/ffshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (nOPTA). A person is said to 'control' a titleholder if they hold 20% or more of the voting rights or issued securities in that titleholder. A change of control will occur if a person controls the titleholder ('original controller') and either another person begins to control the titleholder or the original controller ceases to control the titleholder. In addition to the OPA and regulations, nOPTA will have reference to the applicant suitability guidelines published by the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources in determining change of control applications.\n\n## Santos Barossa decision\n\nIn December 2022, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia handed down its decision in Santos nA Barossa Pty Ltd v Tipakalippa [2002] FCAFC 193 (Appeal Decision). The Appeal Decision decided certain aspects of the requirements for consultation associated with the acceptance of environment plans for o/ffshore petroleum activities by nOPSEMA under the OPGGSA. Subsequently, nOPSEMA published a guideline for industry entitled 'Consultation in the course of preparing an environment plan'. As a consequence of these events, some delays have been experienced by Woodside in obtaining accepted environment plans for petroleum activities in Commonwealth waters. We continue to monitor developments related to this decision. Refer to section 3.9 - Risk factors for further information on risks related to government regulations and other legal developments.\n\n## Domestic gas reservation policy\n\nUnder a Western Australian State Government policy ('WA Domestic Gas Policy'), introduced in 2006, gas equivalent to 15% of LnG production from LnG export projects is required to be reserved for domestic use as a condition of LnG project approval. The policy contains flexibility, allowing negotiations to occur on a case-by-case basis regarding the method by which the LnG project proponents fulfil their domestic gas commitments, including from alternative sources.\n\nWoodside and its joint venture partners have domestic gas contractual commitments in place with the Western Australian State Government for in respect to the Pluto LnG, Wheatstone and nWS projects. In 2015, the nWS State Agreement (north West Gas Development (Woodside) Agreement 1979) was amended to include a new domestic gas commitment of 15% (or lesser approved amount) of total LnG quantity approved for use, supply or sale overseas. In 2006, in connection with the Pluto LnG project, Woodside entered into an arrangement with the Western Australian State Government to market and make available for supply a quantity of domestic gas. Woodside is not required to supply domestic gas if it is not commercially",

        "page_content": "viable to do so. In January 2021, Woodside signed a further agreement with the State Government in relation to the Pluto LnG project in which Woodside agreed to make 45.6 PJ available for the domestic market, separate and in addition to the 2015 commitment from the nWS Joint Venture. In november 2021, Woodside and BHP Petroleum signed a further domestic gas agreement with the State Government with respect to the Scarborough and Pluto Train 2 project pursuant to which, consistent with the WA Domestic Gas Policy, the Scarborough Joint Venture will make gas equivalent to 15% of its LnG exports available to the domestic market. Woodside also has domestic gas commitments in respect to its interest in the Wheatstone LnG Project under a 2011 agreement with the Western Australian State Government.\n\n## Additional major legislation and regulations\n\nWoodside's Australian o/ffshore operations beyond coastal waters are primarily governed by the O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 (Cth) (OPGGSA) and related legislation, which establishes a joint authority (Joint Authority) whereby relevant Australian state, territory and federal governments cooperate in the administration and supervision of petroleum activities in o/ffshore areas beyond coastal waters. The OPGGSA provides for the grant of exploration permits, retention leases, production licences, pipeline licences and facilities licences within the areas of the OPGGSA's jurisdictional operation. Within the coastal waters, petroleum operations are covered by the relevant state or northern Territory legislation that is substantively similar to the OPGGSA.\n\nThe O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Resource Management and Administration) Regulations 2011 (Cth) contain resource management provisions, including a requirement for the holder of a production licence to have in place a Field Development Plan approved by the Joint Authority before petroleum production can commence.\n\nMany of Woodside's operations rely on pipeline licences to transport oil and gas from the point of production to processing facilities and relevant markets. As mentioned above, the OPGGSA also provides for the grant of pipeline licences within the areas of the OPGGSA's jurisdictional operation. Pipelines within the coastal waters of Western Australia are licensed under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1982 (WA) and pipelines within the coastal waters of Victoria are licensed under the O/ffshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2010 (Vic) . Onshore pipelines in Western Australia are licensed under the Petroleum Pipelines Act 1969 (WA) and onshore pipelines in Victoria are licensed under the Pipelines Act 2005 (Vic) .\n\nWoodside is also subject to the following laws, among others:\n\n- \u00b7  Various petroleum taxes, including royalties, excise taxes, temporary levies, and the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax.\n- \u00b7  Australia's competition laws contained in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) , which prohibits, among other things, engaging in conduct with the purpose or e/ffect of substantially lessening competition, price fixing, market\n\nsharing or bid rigging. The Act was also recently amended to allow for the imposition of gas price controls in the eastern Australian gas market. The price of gas produced by Woodside and supplied into the eastern Australian gas market is capped at $12/GJ until 23 December 2023. The price cap could be extended at the same or di/fferent price. The government also proposes implementing a mandatory code of conduct that will apply to gas supplied by producers like Woodside into the eastern Australia gas market, including a 'reasonable pricing' provision.\n\n- \u00b7  Laws protecting the rights and interests of First nations Australians and their cultural heritage. Since 1992, Australian common law has recognised that, in certain circumstances, First nations Australians may have rights and interests over land and waters in accordance with their traditional laws and customs. The Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (nTA) and complimentary state legislation recognise and protect the native title rights and interests of native title holders and registered native title claimants. Multiple pieces of Australian state and federal government legislation protect Aboriginal cultural heritage, rights and access to land in Australia and many of these laws are subject to review and change to ensure a greater level of involvement of First nations Australians in decisions that may impact cultural heritage and other rights and interests.\n- \u00b7  The Greater Sunrise Special Regime (GSSR), established pursuant to the Maritime Boundaries Treaty which came into force on 30 August 2019. Woodside holds PSCs and retention leases covering its petroleum interests within GSSR under joint Australian/Timor-Leste administrative control.\n- \u00b7  The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) (FATA), regulations under the FATA and Australia's Foreign Investment Policy, which are intended to encourage foreign investment in Australia that is not contrary to the Australian national interest. As Woodside is a reporting entity of a critical gas asset within the meaning of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 (Cth) , it is considered a 'national security business' under the FATA, meaning that certain investments by foreign investors (including foreign government investors) must be notified to the Australian Government and require prior approval from the Australian Treasurer in accordance with the FATA.\n- \u00b7  Legislation covering work health and safety (WHS) in both state and federal jurisdictions, with separate onshore and o/ffshore regulation. WHS laws aim to protect people's health and safety at work by imposing obligations on all parties who are in a position to contribute to the management of workplace risks, including manufacturers and suppliers of equipment and substances, as well as employers, workers, contractors and others. Among other things, Woodside-as operator of both onshore and o/ffshore facilities-is required to develop and comply with a comprehensive 'safety case' which describes the facility and provides details on the hazards and risks associated with the facility, the risk controls and the safety management system that will be used to minimise the risks.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7  Federal and state legislation regarding terms and conditions of employment as set forth in the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (FW Act) . Key potential issues which may rise under the FW Act regime for Woodside include a union right of entry to the premises, good faith bargaining principles, and protected industrial action, among others. State legislation regulates matters such as long service leave, workers' compensation, anti-discrimination and equal opportunity, and work health and safety.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the United States, numerous federal agencies regulate specific\n\nportions of the industry and Woodside's US operations. The US federal government directly regulates the development of hydrocarbon interests on federal lands, including those in the US Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and elsewhere in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Federal leasing activities in recent years have been subject to material uncertainties, delays, and legal challenges relating to potential impacts from climate change related to new o/ffshore exploration and production or the adequacy of federal environmental reviews required to be performed in connection with GOM lease auctions. Woodside's hydrocarbon activities on federal o/ffshore oil and natural gas leases in the GOM are subject to extensive regulation and permitting by multiple federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior (DOI), through its agencies the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the O/ffice of natural Resources Revenue (OnRR). These leases, which contain relatively standardised terms, are awarded by the BOEM based on competitive bidding and require compliance with detailed BSEE and BOEM regulations and orders issued pursuant to various federal laws. Lessees are also required to obtain environmental permits from agencies such as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Certain OCS activities are also subject to regulation by the US Coast Guard. In addition, o/ffshore pipelines, including those located in the GOM, are subject to stringent federal regulation including under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), under the US Department of Transportation. The BSEE has also adopted regulations for o/ffshore pipelines under its jurisdiction covering similar matters. Moreover, our US operations in the GOM are subject to extensive requirements related to the plugging and abandonment of wells and decommissioning of o/ffshore structures and equipment. We may be required to post substantial financial assurance, such as surety bonds, or to otherwise demonstrate financial capability, such as through access to insurance, the costs of which could be material. Further, from time to time BOEM has considered increasing its supplemental bonding requirements, and any such increase could generally stress the capacity of the surety bond market to provide su/fficient bonds to meet resulting demands from the o/ffshore oil and gas industry. In addition, as a result of the merger with BHP's petroleum business, we could also be responsible for plugging and abandonment and decommissioning costs for GOM assets formerly owned or operated by BHP if the current operator of record fails to\n\nperform, and such costs could have a material and adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\n\nThe exploration, production, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas involves risk that hazardous liquids or flammable gases may be released into the environment and may cause substantial harm to the environment, natural resources, or human health and safety. Such incidents, as well as failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, may result in material expenditures for response actions, significant government civil or criminal fines and penalties, liability to government agencies for natural resources damages, and significant business interruption. In addition, a spill on or related to our properties and operations could expose us to joint and several and strict liability, without regard to fault. Existing and new laws and regulations could require us to evaluate and upgrade existing infrastructure and operational practices on an accelerated basis or pursue additional capital projects, any or all of which could result in increased operating costs, which in turn could have a material and adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nLaws and regulations are frequently subject to change, and the general trend in the United States has been for these governmental agencies to continue to evaluate and, as necessary, develop and implement new, more restrictive permitting, performance and disclosure requirements, particularly with respect to the protection of the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, natural resources, and worker health and safety. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing or imposing greater restrictions on exploratory or development drilling for oil and gas for economic, political, social, environmental or other reasons could have a material adverse e/ffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Other jurisdictions\n\nIn Senegal, Woodside's PSC and the prospecting, exploration, exploitation and transportation of hydrocarbons, as well as the tax rules for such activities, are primarily governed by Law no. 98-05 dated 8 January 1998 (Petroleum Code) and its implementing decree no. 98-810 dated 6 October 1998. The Petroleum Code determines that the Senegalese Ministry of Petroleum and Energy is the competent authority for its implementation and is responsible for authorising activities for oil and gas prospecting, exploration, exploitation and transportation. A revised Petroleum Code was introduced in 2019, however, the terms of that legislation state that any PSC issued prior to the introduction of the 2019 Petroleum Code retain their legal regime, and as such, the 1998 Petroleum Code continues to apply to Woodside's PSC. There is also other legislation and regulation that applies to Woodside's activities in Senegal including, without limitation, in respect of the environment and local content requirements.\n\n## Material limitations\n\nWoodside has certain obligations as part of its operations in Western Australia to provide natural gas into the Western",

Insurance or other indemnification protection may o/ffset the financial impact on Woodside of a successful claim.\n\nExcept as set forth below, there are no governmental, legal or arbitral proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened and of which Woodside is aware) which may have, or have had during the 12 months prior to the date of this report a significant e/ffect on Woodside's financial position or profitability:\n\n- \u00b7  In June 2022, the Environmental Defenders O/ffice Ltd (on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation) commenced Federal Court proceedings seeking an injunction to restrain Woodside from carrying out the Scarborough gas project.\n- \u00b7  In november 2021, the Conservation Council of Western Australia filed an application seeking judicial review of a decision by the CEO of the Western Australian Department of Water and Environmental Regulation to grant Woodside a works approval for the Pluto Train 2 project granted in May 2021. The matter was heard by the Supreme Court of Western Australia in August 2022.\n- \u00b7  In December 2020, the Conservation Council of Western Australia filed applications seeking judicial review of decisions in respect of approvals under section 45C of the Environmental Protection Act (WA) granted for each of the north West Shelf and Pluto Gas Plant. Each approval was granted in July 2019. The Supreme Court of Western Australia dismissed the proceedings in March 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Exchange controls\n\nThe United States does not presently impose restrictions on the transfer of capital to and from the United States beyond certain currency reporting requirements or economic sanctions regimes. non-United States resident shareholders may currently receive dividend payments without United States governmental approval so long as the recipient is not a designated target of United States sanctions.\n\nUnder Australian foreign exchange controls currently in e/ffect, transfers of capital to and from Australia are not subject to prior government approval and, except as described below, Australia does not restrict the flow of currency into or out of the country. Regulations may be made under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 of Australia (AML/ CTF Act) prohibiting the entering into of transactions involving prescribed foreign countries. As of the date of this report, no such regulations are in place. To control tax evasion and money laundering, the AML/CTF Act also requires certain transactions to be reported to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center and prohibits reporting entities from providing certain services to customers without having complied with certain obligations under the AML/CTF Act (for example 'know your customer' checks). The Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011 promulgated under the Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011 of Australia, the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 of Australia and other acts and regulations in Australia restrict or prohibit payments, transactions or other dealings with assets having a proscribed connection with certain countries or named individuals or entities subject to financial sanctions or identified with terrorism. The Australian Department of Foreign A/ffairs and Trade maintains a list of all persons and entities subject to financial sanctions or having a proscribed connection with terrorism which is available to the public at the Department of Foreign A/ffairs and Trade's website. There are no specific restrictions regarding the remittance of profits, dividends or capital.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe following describes the material US and Australian federal income tax considerations of the ownership and disposition of Woodside shares or Woodside ADSs (together, 'Woodside Securities') for beneficial owners of Woodside Securities that are US Holders (as defined below). This discussion applies only to Woodside Securities held as a 'capital asset' for US federal income tax purposes (generally property held for investment). This summary is based on the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the 'Code'), US Treasury regulations, Australian tax law, any tax treaties, administrative rulings, and judicial decisions, all as in e/ffect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change and di/ffering interpretations, possibly with retroactive e/ffect. Woodside cannot assure you that any such change or di/ffering interpretation will not significantly alter the tax considerations described in this discussion. Woodside has not sought and will not seek any rulings from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the Australian\n\nTaxation O/ffice (ATO) with respect to the statements, positions or conclusions described in the following discussion. Such statements, positions and conclusions are not free from doubt, and there can be no assurance that an applicable tax adviser, the IRS, the ATO or a court will agree with such statements, positions, and conclusions.

        "page_content": "## US Holder defined\n\nFor the purposes of this discussion, the term 'US Holder' is used to mean a beneficial owner of Woodside Securities that, for US federal income tax purposes, is:\n\n- \u00b7  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;\n- \u00b7  a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes) created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia\n- \u00b7  an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source\n- \u00b7  a trust (A) the administration of which is subject to the primary supervision of a US court and which has one or more 'United States persons' (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (B) that has made a valid election under applicable US Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.\n\nIf a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes) holds Woodside Securities, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership might depend upon the status of the partner or the partnership, upon the activities of the partnership and upon certain determinations made at the partnership or partner level. Accordingly, Woodside urges partners in partnerships (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes) holding Woodside Securities to consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisers regarding the US federal income and other tax considerations to them of the matters discussed below.\n\n## American Depositary Shares\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, US Holders of Woodside ADSs generally should be treated as the beneficial owners of the underlying shares represented by the ADSs and an exchange of ADSs for such underlying shares generally will not be subject to US federal income tax. Throughout the remainder of this discussion, any reference to a holder of Woodside shares is assumed to include holders of Woodside ADSs.\n\n## Material US federal income tax considerations for US Holders with respect to the ownership and disposition of Woodside securities\n\nWoodside PFIC considerations\n\nAdverse and burdensome US federal income tax rules and consequences apply to US Holders that hold stock in a non-US corporation classified as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for US federal income tax purposes. In general, Woodside would be treated as a PFIC in any taxable year in which, after applying certain look-through rules, either:\n\n- 1.  at least 75% of its gross income for such taxable year, including its pro rata share of the gross income of any corporation in which it is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, consists of passive income (which generally includes dividends, interest, rents and royalties (other than rents\n\n- or royalties derived from the active conduct of a trade or business) and gains from the disposition of passive assets)\n- 2. at least 50% of its assets in such taxable year (ordinarily determined based on fair market value and averaged quarterly over the year), including its pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which Woodside is considered to own at least 25% of the shares by value, produce or are held for the production of passive income.\n\nWhile Woodside does not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the current or future taxable years, there can be no assurance that it will not be a PFIC for any taxable year, as PFIC status is tested each taxable year and depends on the composition of its assets and income in such taxable year. If Woodside is classified as a PFIC for any year during which a US Holder holds Woodside Securities, Woodside will generally continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such US Holder holds Woodside Securities. Because PFIC status is a fact- intensive determination made on an annual basis and depends on the composition of Woodside's assets and income at such time, no assurance can be given that Woodside is not or will not become classified as a PFIC. If Woodside were later determined to be a PFIC, you may be unable to make certain advantageous elections with respect to your ownership of Woodside Securities (including a 'mark-to-market' election or a 'qualified electing fund' election) that would mitigate the adverse consequences of Woodside's PFIC status, or making such elections retroactively could have adverse tax consequences to you. Woodside has not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS or any opinion from any tax adviser as to such tax treatment. Thus, the anticipated reporting position of Woodside described herein is not free from doubt. Woodside is not representing to you that Woodside will not be treated as a PFIC for the current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year.\n\nConsistent with Woodside's expectation, the remainder of this discussion assumes that Woodside will not be treated as a PFIC in the current taxable year or any subsequent taxable year.\n\nTHE PFIC RULES ARE COMPLEX AnD UnCERTAIn. US HOLDERS SHOULD COnSULT WITH, AnD RELY SOLELY UPOn, THEIR TAX ADVISERS TO DETERMInE THE APPLICATIOn OF THE PFIC RULES TO THEM AnD AnY RESULTAnT TAX COnSEQUEnCES.\n\nTax characterisation of distributions with respect to Woodside Securities\n\nIf Woodside pays a distribution in cash or other property to US Holders of Woodside Securities, such distribution generally will constitute a dividend for US federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under US federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the US Holder's adjusted tax basis in its Woodside Securities. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realised on the sale of Woodside Securities and will be treated as in the section entitled 'Gain or loss on sale or",

        "page_content": "other taxable exchange or disposition of Woodside securities'. However, because Woodside does not expect to determine its earnings and profits on the basis of United States federal income tax principles, US holders should expect that any distribution paid will generally be reported to them as a 'dividend' for US federal income tax purposes.\n\nThe amount of any distribution paid in a foreign currency will be equal to the US dollar value of such currency, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such distribution is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into US dollars at that time. If the distribution is converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, a US Holder should not be required to recognise foreign currency gain or loss in respect of the income attributable to such distribution. A US Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the distribution is converted into US dollars after the date of receipt. In general, foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as US-source ordinary income or loss.\n\n## Distributions treated as dividends\n\nDividends paid by Woodside will be taxable to a corporate US Holder at regular rates and will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. Dividends Woodside pays to a non-corporate US Holder generally will constitute a 'qualified dividend' that will be subject to US federal income tax at the maximum tax rate accorded to long-term capital gains if Woodside Securities are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States or if Woodside is eligible for certain benefits under the tax treaty between the United States and Australia and certain holding period and other requirements are met, including that Woodside is not classified as a PFIC during the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or a preceding taxable year. If such requirements are not satisfied, a non-corporate US Holder may be subject to tax on the dividend at regular ordinary income tax rates instead of the preferential rate that applies to qualified dividend income. US Holders should consult with, and rely solely upon, their tax advisers regarding the availability of the lower preferential rate for qualified dividend income for any dividends paid with respect to Woodside Securities.\n\nWoodside believes that it currently is, and anticipates continuing to be, eligible for benefits under the tax treaty between the United States and Australia. Under a published IRS notice, common or ordinary shares, or ADSs representing such shares, are considered to be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States if they are listed on the nYSE, as the Woodside ADSs are expected to be so listed. However, based on existing guidance, it is unclear whether the shares underlying the ADSs will be considered to be readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, because only the ADSs will be listed on a securities market in the United States. US Holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisers regarding the availability of the favorable rate applicable to qualified dividend income for any dividends Woodside pays with respect to the ADSs.\n\nDividends paid with respect to Woodside Securities generally will constitute foreign source income for US foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Subject to certain complex conditions and limitations, any Australian taxes withheld on any distributions on Woodside Securities may be eligible for credit against a US Holder's federal income tax liability or, at such holder's election, may be eligible as a deduction in computing such holder's US federal taxable income. If a refund of the tax withheld is available under the laws of Australia or under the tax treaty between the United States and Australia, as amended, the amount of tax withheld that is refundable will not be eligible for such credit against a US Holder's US federal income tax liability (and will not qualify for the deduction against US federal taxable income). If the dividends constitute qualified dividend income as discussed above, the amount of the dividend taken into account for purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit limitation will generally be limited to the gross amount of the dividend, multiplied by the reduced rate applicable to the qualified dividend income, divided by the highest rate of tax normally applicable to dividends. The limitation on foreign taxes eligible for the credit is calculated separately concerning specific classes of income. For this purpose, dividends distributed by Woodside with respect to Woodside Securities will generally constitute 'passive category income.' The rules relating to the determination of the US foreign tax credit are complex, and US Holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon, their tax advisers regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit in their particular circumstances and the possibility of claiming an itemised deduction (in lieu of the foreign tax credit) for any foreign taxes paid or withheld.\n\n## Withholding tax in Australia\n\nThe Australian withholding tax consequences of dividends paid to non-Australian resident shareholders are outlined in the section entitled 'Material Australian tax considerations'. If Australian dividend withholding tax is payable on dividends from Woodside, US Holders should seek their own tax advice to determine the Australian and US taxation implications.\n\nGain or loss on sale or other taxable exchange or disposition of Woodside Securities\n\nUpon a sale or other taxable exchange or disposition of Woodside Securities (including any portion of a distribution by Woodside treated as such per the section entitled '-Tax Characterisation of Distributions with Respect to Woodside Securities'), a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the di/fference between (i) the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such exchange or disposition and (ii) the US Holder's adjusted tax basis in its Woodside Securities so disposed of. A US Holder's adjusted tax basis in its Woodside Securities generally will equal the US Holder's purchase price, or if acquired pursuant to the Special Dividend, the fair market value, (in each case, expressed in US dollars) for the Woodside Securities, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any prior distributions paid to such US Holder that were treated as a return of capital for US federal income tax purposes. Any such capital",

        "page_content": "gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US Holder held the Woodside Securities for more than one year. Long-term capital gains recognised by non-corporate US Holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates. In addition, the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nGain or loss, if any, realised by a US Holder on the sale or other disposition of Woodside Securities generally will be treated as US source gain or loss for US foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The use of US foreign tax credits relating to any Australian tax imposed upon the sale or other disposition of Woodside Securities may be unavailable or limited and may depend upon the application of the tax treaty between the United States and Australia to such US Holder. US Holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisers regarding the tax consequences if Australian taxes are imposed on or connected with a sale or other disposition of Woodside Securities and their ability to credit any Australian tax against their US federal income tax liability.\n\n## Australian CGT consequences\n\nAustralian capital gains tax (CGT) consequences of disposals of Woodside Securities by US holders are outlined in the section entitled 'Material Australian Tax Considerations-Disposals of Woodside shares'. If any tax is payable in Australia on a gain accruing on the disposal of Woodside Securities, US Holders should seek their own tax advice to determine the Australian and US taxation implications.\n\n## Information reporting and backup witholding\n\nDividends with respect to Woodside Securities and proceeds from the sale or exchange of Woodside Securities may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a US Holder that (i) is a corporation or entity that is otherwise exempt from backup withholding (which, when required, certifies as to its exempt status) or (ii) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number and makes any other required certification on IRS Form W-9. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the US federal income tax liability (if any) of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If backup withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund generally may be obtained, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.\n\n## Additional information reporting requirements\n\nCertain US Holders may be required to comply with certain reporting requirements relating to the Woodside Securities with respect to the holding of certain foreign financial assets, including stock of foreign issuers (such as Woodside). Penalties can apply if US Holders fail to satisfy such reporting requirements. US Holders are urged to consult with, and rely solely upon, their own tax advisers regarding the application of these rules to their ownership of the Woodside Securities.\n\n## Material Australian tax considerations\n\nDividends (including other distributions treated as dividends for Australian tax purposes) paid by Woodside to a US Holder\n\nthat is not an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes will generally not be subject to Australian withholding tax if they are fully franked (broadly, where a dividend is franked, tax paid by Woodside is imputed to the shareholders).\n\nDividends paid to such US Holders, which are not fully franked, will generally be subject to Australian withholding tax not exceeding 15% only to the extent (if any) that the dividend is neither:\n\n- \u00b7  franked; nor\n- \u00b7  declared by Woodside to be conduit foreign income. (Broadly, this means that the relevant part of the dividend is declared to have been paid out of foreign source amounts received by Woodside that are not subject to tax in Australia, such as dividends remitted to Australia by foreign subsidiaries).\n\nThe Australian withholding tax outcome described above applies to US Holders who are eligible for benefits under the Tax Convention between Australia and the US as to the Avoidance of Double Taxation (the Australian Tax Treaty). Otherwise, the rate of Australian withholding tax may be 30%.\n\nIn contrast, dividends (including other distributions treated as dividends for Australian tax purposes) paid by Woodside to a US Holder may instead by taxed by assessment in Australia if the US Holder:\n\n- \u00b7  is an Australian resident for Australian tax purposes (although tax will generally not exceed 15% where the US Holder is eligible for benefits under the Australian Tax Treaty as a treaty resident of the US and any franking credits may be creditable against their Australian income tax liability); or\n- \u00b7  carries on business in Australia through a permanent establishment as defined in the Australian Tax Treaty, or performs personal services from a fixed base in Australia, and the shareholding in respect of which the dividend is paid is e/ffectively connected with that permanent establishment or fixed base, (however, in such a case any franking credits may be creditable against the Australian income tax liability).\n\nThe treatment of dividends outlined above may be modified where the shareholding in Woodside is held through a trust, limited partnership, limited liability company, pension fund, sovereign wealth fund or other investment vehicle. A/ffected US Holders should seek their own advice in relation to such arrangements.\n\n## Material Australian tax considerations-disposals of Woodside Securities\n\nGains made by US Holders on the sale of Woodside Securities will generally not be taxed in Australia.\n\nHowever, the precise Australian tax treatment of gains made by US Holders on the sale of Woodside Securities generally depends on whether or not the gain is an Australian sourced gain of an income nature for Australian income tax purposes.\n\nWhere the gain is of an income nature, a US Holder will generally only be liable to Australian income tax on an assessment basis (whether or not they are also an Australian resident for",

The IMR exemptions broadly apply to widely held IMR entities in relation to their direct investments and indirect investments made through an independent Australian fund manager. The exemptions apply to gains made by IMR entities that are treated as companies for Australian tax purposes as well as gains made by non-resident investors in IMR entities that are treated as trusts and partnerships for Australian tax purposes.\n\nTHE FOREGOInG DISCUSSIOn IS nOT TAX ADVICE OR A COMPREHEnSIVE DISCUSSIOn OF ALL US AnD AUSTRALIAn FEDERAL InCOME TAX COnSEQUEnCES TO US HOLDERS OF WOODSIDE SECURITIES.

In addition to the financial information contained in this report presented in accordance with IFRS, certain 'non-GAAP financial measures' (as defined in Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K under the US Securities Act of 1933 , as amended) have been included in this report. These measures include EBIT, EBITDA excluding impairment, Gearing, Underlying nPAT, net debt, Free cash flow, Capital expenditure, Exploration expenditure, net tangible assets, and net tangible asset per ordinary security. These non-IFRS financial measures are defined section 6.8 Glossary, units of measure and conversion factors. This section provides a reconciliation of these measures to Woodside's Financial Statements.\n\nWoodside believes that the non-IFRS financial measures it\n\npresents provide a useful means through which to examine the underlying performance of its business. These measures, however, should not be considered to be an indication of, or alternative to, corresponding measures of gross profit, net profit, cash flows from operating activities, or other figures determined in accordance with IFRS. In addition, such measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\n\nUndue reliance should not be placed on the non-IFRS financial measures contained in this report, and the non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures computed in accordance with IFRS. Although certain of these data have been extracted or derived from Woodside's Financial Statements, these data have not been audited or reviewed by Woodside's independent auditors. You are urged to read carefully the audited Full-year Financial Statements and related notes thereto.\n\n## Definition and calculation of non-IFRS financial information\n\n| Non-IFRS financial  information            | Why is the non-IFRS financial  information useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Calculation  methodology                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| EBIT                                       | Used to assess the Group's operational profitability excluding net finance costs  and taxation expense.

The omitted information relates to our internal budgets, forecasts and estimates, details of our business strategy, and LnG contractual pricing.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis report may contain forward-looking statements with respect to Woodside's business and operations, market conditions, results of operations and financial condition, including, for example, but not limited to, statements about expectations regarding longterm demand for Woodside's products, timing of completion of Woodside's projects, expected synergies from the merger with BHP's petroleum business, expectations regarding growth opportunities, Woodside's strategic framework, Woodside's dividend policy, future results of projects, operating activities, and new energy products, and expectations regarding the achievement of Woodside's Scope 1 and 2 net equity emissions reduction and new energy investment target and other climate, sustainability and ESG goals. All forward-looking statements contained in this report reflect Woodside's views held as at the date of this report. All statements, other than statements of historical or present facts, are forward-looking statements and generally may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as 'guidance', 'foresee', 'likely', 'potential', 'anticipate', 'believe', 'aim', 'estimate', 'expect', 'intend', 'may', 'target', 'plan', 'forecast', 'project', 'schedule', 'will', 'should', 'seek' and other similar words or expressions. Similarly, statements that describe the objectives, plans, goals or expectations of Woodside are or may be forward-looking statements.\n\nThe information and statements in this report about Woodside's future strategy and other forward-looking statements are not guidance, forecasts, guarantees or predictions of future events or performance, but are in the nature of aspirational targets that Woodside has set for itself and its management of the business.\n\nThose statements and any assumptions on which they are based are only opinions and are subject to change without notice and are subject to inherent known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of Woodside, its related bodies corporate and their respective beneficiaries.\n\nImportant factors that could cause actual results to di/ffer materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, fluctuations in commodity prices, actual demand, currency fluctuations, geotechnical factors, drilling and production results, gas commercialisation, development progress, operating results, engineering estimates, reserve estimates, loss of market, industry competition, environmental risks, climate related risks, physical risks, legislative, fiscal and regulatory developments, changes in accounting standards, economic and financial markets conditions in various countries and regions, political risks, project delay or advancement, approvals, cost estimates and the e/ffect of future regulatory or legislative actions on Woodside or the industries in which it operates, including potential changes to tax laws, as well as general economic conditions, prevailing exchange rates and interest rates and conditions in financial markets.\n\nDetails of the key risks relating to Woodside and its business can be found in section 3.8 - Risk factors. You should review and have regard to these risks when considering the information contained in this report.\n\nIf any of the assumptions on which a forward-looking statement is based were to change or be found to be incorrect, this would likely cause outcomes to di/ffer from the statements made in this report.\n\nInvestors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Actual results or performance may vary materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any forward-looking statements. none of Woodside nor any of its related bodies corporate, nor any of their respective beneficiaries, nor any person named in this report or involved in the preparation of the information in this report, makes any representation, assurance, guarantee or warranty (either express or implied) as to the accuracy or likelihood of fulfilment of any forward-looking statement, or any outcomes, events or results expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement in this report.\n\nPast performance (including historical financial information and pro forma information) is given for illustrative purposes only. It should not be relied on and is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance, including future security prices.\n\n## Emissions data\n\nAll greenhouse gas emissions data in this report are estimates, and our methodologies for measuring or quantifying greenhouse gas emissions may evolve as best practices continue to develop and data quality and quantity continue to improve. Woodside 'greenhouse gas' or 'emissions' information reported are Scope 1 GHG emissions, Scope 2 GHG emissions, and Scope 3 GHG emissions. For more information on emissions data refer to the Climate Report 2022 and the Sustainable Development Report 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Industry and market data\n\nThis report contains industry, market and competitive position data that are based on industry publications and studies conducted by third parties as well as Woodside's internal estimates and research. These industry publications and third-party studies generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While Woodside believes that each of these publications and third-party studies is reliable, Woodside has not independently verified the market and industry data obtained from these third-party sources. Forecasts and other forwardlooking information obtained from these sources are subject to the same qualifications and uncertainties as the other forwardlooking statements contained in this report and may di/ffer among third-party sources. These forecasts and forward-looking information are subject to uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in section 3.8 - Risk factors and in this section, section 6.9 - Information about this report. These and other factors could cause results to di/ffer materially from those expressed in Woodside's forecasts or estimates or those of independent third parties. While Woodside believes its internal research is reliable and its selection of industry publications and third-party studies and the description of its market and industry are appropriate, neither such research nor these descriptions have been verified by any independent source.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nWoodside's Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and comply with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\n## Other important information\n\nAll references to dollars, cents or $ in this report are to US currency, unless otherwise stated.\n\nReferences to 'Woodside' may be references to Woodside Energy Group Ltd or its applicable subsidiaries.\n\nThis report does not include any express or implied prices at which Woodside will buy or sell financial products.\n\nThis report contains references to Woodside's website, our Sustainable Development Report 2022 and our Climate Report 2022.
