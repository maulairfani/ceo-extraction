        "page_content": "## Dear shareholders,\n\nThe foundation of our Group rests upon a philosophy of trusteeship, which imagines corporations as institutions that drive collective prosperity. This philosophy has played an integral role in shaping our actions for generations, guiding us in our quest to enrich lives. Over the years, this purpose, though unstated, has been our unwavering anchor.\n\nIn FY 2022-23, we formally put in words our Group's Purpose statement. At its heart is the commitment to enrich lives by building dynamic and responsible businesses and institutions that inspire trust. products, services, solutions, actions,\n\nEvery day, we strive to honour this commitment through our brands, relationships, and institutions.\n\nOur Purpose statement stands both timeless and fresh against the backdrop of our extensive history. In a world of increasing opportunity, and also accelerating uncertainty, our Purpose statement is meant to act as a talisman and remain at the core of our business decisions.\n\nOur Purpose offers us a unique lens with which to view the world, to bring perspective to it, and to thrive in it. Guided by this unique perspective, we navigate the evolving global landscape with resilience and foresight. As we turn our attention to the current state of the global economy, it is evident that we are charting a course through a 'new normal'.\n\nQUOTE ON BOX\n\n## Global economy: Finding a new normal\n\nThe global economy continues to pull itself out of the pandemic-triggered shock. It does so amid a complex environment marked by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, geo-economic fragmentation, soaring interest rates, and looming risks of a banking contagion. Reflecting these concerns, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects global economic growth to dip from 3.4% in CY22 to 2.8% in CY23. Developed countries are predicted to experience a more pronounced deceleration, their aggregate growth stumbling to just 1.3% in CY23-the slowest pace in a decade, excluding the pandemic-impacted CY20.\n\nOn the brighter side, China's economy marches towards normalisation following the lifting of its Covid-related restrictions.\n\nBoth China and India are set to significantly contribute to global economic growth in CY23, providing a much-needed stimulus as developed economies grapple with challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, global supply chain pressures have largely normalised, helping ease commodity prices and peak inflation levels in most economies. Central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, appear to be nearing the end of their rate-hiking phase, signaling cautious optimism for the global economy and financial markets. However, vigilance remains crucial in the face of potential risk events in this fragile environment.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's message\n\n## India: The shining star\n\nIndia's economic narrative paints a much brighter picture. With a government-led push to infrastructure investments and pragmatic policies such as the production-linked incentives scheme, private capex has seen a surge. This rise triggers a multiyear boom, providing valuable support to economic growth in the face of softening global demand.\n\nA decadal reshaping of supply chains is underway. As global corporations start to look at countries across Asia as part of their China + 1 strategies, India is well positioned to benefit. Supported by the dynamism of its tech-based 'new economy' enterprises and the expanding digitisation across sectors, India's growth momentum continues to strengthen.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) projects India's economy to grow at 6.5% in FY24, demonstrating the nation's resilience amidst subdued global economic conditions. Inflation seems to have peaked globally and in India. Easing inflation, robust foreign exchange reserves, and improving bank assets' quality provide a sizable cushion against potential destabilising events in global markets.\n\nA key component of the rise of any industrial ecosystem is the presence of a confident and skilled workforce. This year, India surpassed China in population, and already has the largest and youngest working age population globally. The lessons learnt from the transformations of other economies through the last few decades point to the importance of this demographic dividend.\n\nIn the grand theatre of global economic evolution, India stands not as a mere spectator, but as a charismatic lead.\n\n## Aditya Birla Group in Perspective\n\nAs India takes centre stage in this grand narrative, the Aditya Birla Group finds itself in a unique position to contribute to this monumental journey. Our enduring success amidst global uncertainties stems from our unyielding commitment to purpose, anchored in principles that are much more than just words.\n\nAnd therefore, the articulation of Purpose was just the first step. We cultivated a deep understanding of our Purpose across the depth and breadth of the Group, including the last mile.\n\nTo transform Purpose from a concept to an embodied experience, approximately 600 of our senior leaders and managers took the initiative to receive training and facilitate introspective dialogues on Purpose. This facilitated their teams to internalise, personalise, and actualise our Purpose in a manner that was both unique and authentically representative of their roles within our dynamic Group.\n\nQUOTE ON BOX\n\nDriven by purpose, the fiscal year 2022-23 stands testament to the breadth and scope of entrepreneurial ventures we have embarked upon. We are exploring uncharted territories, backing our conviction with capital and talent. Our robust platform serves as a launch pad for new initiatives, allowing us to tap into opportunities across traditional and sunrise sectors.\n\nThis year, we've emphasised the implementation of our 3-year HR Strategy, guided by our Purpose Principles. This approach has enabled us to build enduring bonds with our stakeholders, including key employee segments, like early professionals, and attract high-quality talent across traditional and digital businesses.\n\nAs we continue to expand, our employer brand has empowered us to attract over 11,000 employees in FY 2022-23 - a diverse pool of new skills and capabilities. Furthermore, our commitment to diversity is evident in the increasing representation of women in our workforce.",

We achieved the distinctive milestone of producing, dispatching, and selling 100 million tons in FY 2022-23, supported by an effective capacity utilisation rate of 84% for the year.\n\nYour Company has embarked on an aggressive capacity expansion path, including both greenfield and brownfield projects, addressing high-growth geographies across the country.\n\nI am pleased to confirm that the capacity expansion programme is progressing on schedule. This year, we commissioned an additional 12.4 MTPA capacity of grey cement and further inaugurated a 2.2 MTPA brownfield cement capacity at Patliputra in April 2023.\n\nYour Company has already kickstarted work on the next growth phase of 22.6 MTPA. Civil construction is in high gear at most sites, with commercial production from these new capacities expected to roll out phase-wise by FY25/FY26. Upon the successful\n\ncompletion of all ongoing expansion projects, your Company's capacity will soar to 160+ MTPA. This growth will solidify our standing as the thirdlargest cement company globally, outside of China, and the unrivalled leader in India.\n\nThe increase in our production capacity aligns with the strengthening of our brand equity in the marketplace. It's gratifying to note that your Company has not only sustained but significantly amplified its brand equity over recent years.\n\nAs an integrated building solutions provider offering a broad range of products and services, UltraTech is well-positioned to harness the burgeoning opportunity in India. The strategic actions taken over the past few years and the projects currently underway bear testament to our unwavering commitment to be a strategic partner in India's development journey.\n\nQUOTE ON BOX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability is at the core of what we do. It is our stated strategy to integrate sustainability into the value chain of our operations.

UltraTech remains focused on accelerating the transition of its operations towards green energy.\n\nUltraTech recently showcased innovation by utilising both sea and inland waterways to transport a bulk cargo carrier loaded with 57,000 metric tonnes (MT) of phosphogypsum. This material, a byproduct of the industry, was safely moved from the Paradip port in Odisha to UltraTech's jetty in the Amreli district's Kovaya in Gujarat. It will be used in our cement manufacturing operations, demonstrating a safe and effective method for disposing of this industry waste.\n\nThis initiative, the first of its kind in India, is groundbreaking. We are optimistic that it will inspire other cement companies to adopt similar strategies, thereby contributing to a safe and sustainable method of dealing with the country's phosphogypsum stockpile, a significant environmental concern.\n\nWe are encouraged by the recognition our sustainability efforts have received both nationally and globally. Notably, UltraTech was recently ranked first in Sustainability in the Infrastructure and Engineering sector by Sustain Labs Paris (SLP) in partnership with BW Businessworld.\n\nQUOTE ON BOX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to addressing climate change was recognised by the global non-profit organisation, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).

It serves as the bedrock that propels us towards the future, emboldening us to venture into more significant commitments and pursuits.\n\nAs we grow, we expand our capacity to receive by enhancing our absorption of talent, technology, and capital. Indeed, with each stride in growth, we deftly weave in more threads of insights and capabilities, enriching the tapestry of our collective endeavour. This, in turn, enables us to increase our ability to give back, create impact, and enrich lives. This virtuous cycle is at the heart of being a successful purpose-driven organisation.\n\nYour Company doesn't just pride itself on being a purpose-driven entity-it embodies it, living out this ethos in every endeavour, every relationship, and every venture.

As a part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G), over five million rural houses were built in FY 2022-23. Clearly, India's path to the US$ 5 trillion economy goal is being built on the foundation of a robust infrastructure for the country. As a direct implication of the boost in infrastructure spending, the cement sector experienced an increase in demand, thus resulting in a need to expand capacity. We are well positioned to harness the next phase of economic growth, having embarked on an ambitious capacity expansion drive. On completion, this will take your Company to 160+ MTPA production capacity in the next 2-3 years.\n\nIn the financial year gone by, your Company achieved yet another historic milestone registering 100+ million tonnes of grey cement production, dispatch, and sales. It is an incredible achievement as it comes within just five years of your Company achieving a production capacity of 100+ MTPA. This achievement is the result of diligent efforts of all your Company's employees collaborating seamlessly across geographies, functions, and businesses.\n\nSustainability is a key part of your Company's growth strategy. This year, it set a new benchmark in its contribution to the circular economy when it transported a large consignment of phosphogypsum, using inland and coastal waterways, from Paradip port in Odisha to the jetty of your Company's Gujarat Cement Unit located at Kovaya in Gujarat. Circular economy is one of the key focus areas of your Company's sustainability drive. The cement industry is at the heart of the circular economy framework in India. By using industrial and municipal waste in cement manufacturing, your Company helps to substantially reduce the burden on landfill as well as reduce potential Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from conventional waste disposal methods such as incineration.\n\nIt is indeed a matter of pride for all of us that the sustainability efforts at your Company are paying off. Your Company is tracking well on all its key ESG commitments. With net 557 kg CO 2 /tonnes of cementitious products in FY 2022-23, your Company's CO 2 net intensity has decreased by 12% against the commitment of 27% reduction by 2032, from the base year of 2017. Your Company has achieved a water positivity of 4.17 and plastic negative of 2.44 times. It has similarly made significant progress on the energy transition journey by increasing the use of Green Energy. Your Company currently has 555 MW of Green Energy capacity, registering an increase of over 25% in WHRS capacity and over 28% in renewable (solar+wind) energy capacity.\n\nThe progress on the sustainability agenda has won your Company global recognition. This year, your Company was recognised as a leader in climate change by CDP.\n\nWe also have the distinction of being recognised as the only Indian company to rank among the top 10 globally in the Construction Material sector for the second year in a row, by S&P's Global Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI).\n\nYour Company has always striven towards creating value for all its stakeholders. This has been on the back of cost leadership and continuously enhancing process efficiency. We delivered robust financial results in a difficult operating environment characterised by significant increase in input costs through the year. We achieved a strong operating performance, recording 14% YoY volume growth. The strength of your Company's operations is amply exemplified by the fact that it has generated positive cash flow even after meeting all ongoing capex, working capital and dividend payment requirements, and has still been able to deleverage a bit.\n\nWhile we reflect on the year gone by, it is also important for us to look ahead on how the world around us is evolving. Cost pressures, strained supply chains, rising environmental concerns and increasing competition will continue to be the new normal. As the largest cement and ready-mix concrete company in India and the third largest cement company globally (excluding China), your Company believes that it has the responsibility to steer the way ahead for the industry, towards a greener future, while delivering sustainable growth. Your Company is fully cognisant of its responsibility and will continue to do its best in driving sustainability across the value chain of operations, while delivering value to all stakeholders.\n\n## K.

The specialist building products included Basekrete, Readiplast and Sprayo Plast.\n\nA Platinum-rated green building, the new Parliament building's work began in 2019, but the pandemic disrupted the process. Our team was approached to help accelerate the labourintensive process of plastering. Our R&D and Building Products Division's (BPD) technical teams came up with an innovative idea of\n\nmachine plastering using our Sprayo Plast, reducing time and manpower. Successful testing and training led to implementation in just three months. Machine plastering reduced time by three-fold and manpower by two-thirds. The use of Sprayo Plast achieved high-quality finishing in a single coat, especially in the basement.",

Therefore, ensuring the safety of people involved in our operations remains the central focus of our Company.\n\n## Cause of impact on value chain\n\nWe recognise our employees as our most valuable asset. Any safety incident that poses a risk of physical or psychological harm not only affects the well-being of our employees but also hampers their productivity.\n\n## Business strategy\n\nWe have a 'Zero Tolerance' Policy for safety breaches, and we thoroughly assess vendors based on stringent safety criteria before onboarding them. Health and Safety are deeply ingrained in our governance structure, with both Board-level and Unit-level committees overseeing safety leading and lagging indicators.\n\nFurthermore, we are making substantial investments in digitalisation to enhance safety measures. Our AI-based chatbot, USHA, provides company-wide safety training online, and we utilise wearables integrated with IT-enabled systems to conduct safety audits remotely.\n\n## Our target\n\nTarget for zero fatality by 2024.\n\n## Our progress\n\n86% reduction in fatality from last year.\n\n## Circular economy\n\n## Business impact\n\nWe believe that embracing the circular economy has the potential to enhance our overall margins by reducing fuel and material costs.\n\n## Cause of impact on value chain\n\nThe circular economy presents a significant four-fold opportunity for our Company in the cement industry. Firstly, by utilising waste and byproducts from other industries as alternative fuel and raw materials, we can reduce our dependence on non-renewable resources like limestone and fossil-based fuel. Secondly, this shift towards alternative materials helps us reduce our carbon footprint. Thirdly, these waste materials are available at a lower cost compared to conventional materials. Finally, by actively supporting other industries and local urban bodies in implementing sustainable waste management solutions, we can enhance our brand image and reputation, showcasing our commitment to environmental responsibility and compliance with regulations.\n\n## Business strategy\n\nWe are making significant investments in waste pre-processing and co-processing infrastructure, supported by state-of-the-art R&D laboratories, to strengthen our capacity for circular economy practices. We actively use various industrial wastes such as slag, gypsum, fly ash, and more as raw materials, while also incorporating alternative fuels like municipal solid waste, industrial waste, and plastic waste into our operations. Additionally, we are committed to utilising Construction & Demolition waste in our Ready-Mix Concrete plants, further contributing to sustainable resource management.\n\n## Our target\n\nMaximise the usage of industrial and other waste.\n\n## Our progress\n\n- \u00b7 Substitution of 20.60% conventional raw material through recycled and alternative raw material in cement production.\n- \u00b7 Substitution of 5.2% thermal energy from fossil-based fuel through alternative fuel resources.\n- \u00b7 Utilisation of 8512 metric tonnes of C&D aggregates in RMC plants.",

While our primary market is currently focused within the country and its neighbouring regions, we recognise that the outlook for exports, along with the global transition to a low-carbon economy and evolving customer preferences, may have an impact on our overall profit margins.\n\n## Cause of impact on value chain\n\nAs a cement manufacturer, we acknowledge that our industry is inherently carbon intensive due to the nature of our raw materials. This places us in the category of a hard-to-abate sector when it comes to reducing GHG emissions. We recognise the potential risks associated with upcoming global regulations aimed at curbing emissions. Failure to meet our Net Zero target within the specified timeframe could result in reputational damage, loss of brand value, and financial implications for our Company.\n\n## Business strategy\n\nWe have taken proactive steps to drive sustainability and reduce our environmental impact. This includes adopting voluntary targets for GHG emission reduction, replacing fossil-based electricity with renewable energy sources and implementing Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) across our manufacturing Units. We are also optimising our product mix by incorporating lower cementitious content, prioritising the use of sustainable materials. Furthermore, we are actively exploring innovative technologies like Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) in collaboration with startups such as CarbonOrO, Coomtech, and Fortera. Additionally, we are considering kiln electrification with Coolbrook to further enhance our carbon reduction efforts.\n\n## Our target\n\n- \u00b7 Reduction of net specific Scope 1 emissions by 27% by 2032, from 2017 as base year.\n- \u00b7 Substitution of 34% of electricity by green energy by 2024.\n\n## Our progress\n\n- \u00b7 12% reduction in specific net CO 2 emissions till FY 2022-23.\n- \u00b7 19.27% electricity substituted through green energy.\n- \u00b7 MoU signed with Coolbrook for implementation of their technology RotoDynamic Heater TM .\n\n## Impact on external stakeholders\n\n## Enhancing livelihoods through watershed management\n\nIn an effort to tackle the issue of water scarcity in the semi-arid and drought prone Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh, our team has adopted the villages of Ayyavaripalli in Anantapur district and Petnikota in Nandyal district. In collaboration with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), we have implemented an integrated watershed project to address the critical water shortage in the area. With groundwater levels depleting at an alarming rate of 30% annually, we have constructed seven water harvesting structures in Ayyavaripalli village (Kolimigundla Mandal) and Petnikota village (Tadipatri Mandal) to replenish groundwater and ensure a sustainable water supply throughout the year.\n\n## Impact of the integrated watershed project\n\n- \u00b7 The project has positively impacted more than 2,000 individuals residing in 500 households across the villages.\n- \u00b7 The rainwater harvesting structures constructed in Petnikota and Ayyavaripalli have provided a water storage capacity of approximately 35,000 m 3 .\n- \u00b7 The rainwater harvesting structures have harvested about 5,00,000 m 3 of water since January 2023.\n- \u00b7 Groundwater levels in the watershed areas have increased by 2-4 metres as a result of the rainwater harvesting structures.\n- \u00b7 Through watershed interventions, approximately 400 acres of previously barren land have been cultivated in both villages.\n\n## Waste diverted from landfill, incineration and open burning\n\nThe waste generated in proximity to our operations, including municipal waste and agricultural residues, is collected, and utilised in our kilns' high-temperature process. This approach effectively prevents landfilling and minimises open burning, significantly reducing our environmental impact.\n\n## Impact of the waste diverted\n\n- \u00b7 We have successfully diverted 630,000 tonnes of waste from ending up in landfills, being incinerated, or being subjected to open burning.\n- \u00b7 Through this initiative, we have aligned our vision with the 'Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan' (Clean India Mission).",

We boast a highly robust Risk Governance structure led by the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee, helmed by an Independent Director. The Committee convenes every six months to oversee the Risk Evaluation, Identification, Assessment, and Mitigation processes. This approach ensures effective management of emerging and existing risks.\n\n## Risk identification\n\nWe have a robust risk identification process in place, where we thoroughly analyse risks, understand their detailed descriptions along with their likelihood and potential impact. We conduct an annual risk review process within our organisation, thereby, ensuring its compliance and effectiveness.\n\n## Risk process\n\nOur risk management structure operates independently from our business lines, ensuring objective oversight. We have integrated risk criteria into our product development and approval process, emphasising the importance of risk management as a fundamental component of our operations. We also foster an effective risk culture by encouraging employees to proactively identify and report potential risks. In addition, risk management criteria are incorporated into the HR review process, allowing us to assess individual performance and recognise contributions to risk mitigation. Our Senior Executives and line Managers actively strive to achieve key performance indicators and targets, encompassing both financial and non-financial aspects, and their performance evaluations and compensation reflect their effectiveness in managing risks and meeting set objectives.\n\n## Risk training\n\nWe prioritise continuous training and education on risk management principles across our Company. We also provide comprehensive training programmes for employees to increase awareness and knowledge of risk identification and mitigation. The training covers a wide range of topics including Code of Conduct, Health & Safety, Social Responsibility, Logistics Safety, Cybersecurity, Environmental Responsibility, and Legal Compliance.",

In terms of our R&D investment, our revenue expenditure for the year is C 11.61 crores.\n\n## Solving building and infrastructure challenges with new materials\n\nWe have completed lab scale testing this year for the development of machine printable structural concrete that significantly reduces the time of construction, allowing for faster building of structures. Additionally, we have developed Ultra High-Performance Concrete (UHPC) for use in high rise buildings, which reduces the column size and possesses higher early strength, enabling quicker restoration of traffic in road applications.\n\nWe have also developed low-density concrete to reduce the dead load in structures and permeable concrete for use in open spaces and parking areas to recharge ground water. Furthermore, we have developed a new method to identify adulteration in market RMC concrete based on thermal signatures and filed for an Indian patent.\n\n## Our product development and innovation strategy\n\nWe remain committed to investing our resources in the development of low carbon products, sustainable energy sources, resource conservation, reducing our carbon footprint, increasing product life cycle, and imparting new functional attributes to cement and its application to concrete.\n\nWe are currently focused on developing and testing 3D printable concrete mixes in-house, which will enable us to attain faster, cheaper, safer, and more efficient construction, and also aligns with the government's 'Housing for All' scheme.\n\n## Key focus areas\n\nWe conduct field-scale testing of our in-house developed 3D printable mixes with different types of concrete grades and structures. We then perform detailed testing of various parameters on the built structures to evaluate their actual performance and estimate their lifecycle. Our goal is to develop performance concrete with a high percentage of replacement of Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs), such as over 50% cement replacement by fly ash or slag, and 3D printable concrete formulations with 30% SCMs.\n\n## New launches\n\nWe have developed two more innovative products, Weather Plus and UltraTech Premium, to provide enhanced performance in terms of strength development and better resistance to water permeability. These products are designed to improve the life cycle and stability of the structures. We have also formulated a special cement with improved crack resistance properties in both mortar and concrete, which can significantly enhance the life cycle of the structures.",

This enables us to identify specific areas where we need to enhance our control systems, to prevent the recurrence of incidents.\n\nData analytics help us obtain safety insights from safety observations and the near misses at our Units. We provide the Units with detailed analysis, including section/area-wise, contractor-wise, and standard-wise breakdowns, enabling them to take focused, risk-based corrective actions.\n\n## Video Enabled Decisions and Alerts (VEDA)\n\nBy deploying custom built AI/ML models for analysing video feeds to provide real-time, actionable insights and alerts 24*7, automated analysis of feeds using AI in an on-premise server is carried out. This raises audiovisual alarms through real-time voice, text and e-mail alerts in case of any deviation, while enabling monitoring of safety trends through the dashboard. VEDA has been instrumental in identifying non-adherence of arc flash suit in substation, heat resistant PPE while working with hot materials.\n\n## Continuous PPE upgradation\n\nWe frequently assess the quality, protection factor, and suitability of PPEs based on Unit feedback. We work closely with vendors to upgrade PPEs as needed.\n\n## Corrective actions\n\n## Prevention of incident recurrence and compliance tracking\n\nWe consider incident learning as a crucial aspect of our safety management. We share serious incident findings and recommended actions via RCN to facilitate organisation-wide learning. The Unit incident investigation sub-committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with the recommended actions, and we track progress through monthly safety reports from each Unit.\n\n## Consequence management\n\nWe maintain a zero-tolerance policy towards unsafe behaviour. If the cause of a mishap is revealed to be at-risk or reckless behaviour, we apply a consequence management approach. Disciplinary action is taken against individuals and groups, and this is reflected in their performance appraisal through our ERP software.",

        "page_content": "## Enhancing health and safety\n\n## Safety training and initiatives\n\nWe organised around 750,000 man-hours of safety training across all our Units this year. Here is a brief description of the various initiatives undertaken:\n\n## Standard champions training\n\nWe implemented the 'Standard Champions training' programme, under which we trained 500 employees across all our Units, on 18 safety standards. This led to the creation of a pool of competent trainers who could impart knowledge to their colleagues and contribute towards helping us achieve our safety goals.\n\n## E-learning modules\n\nWe developed e-learning modules on critical processes such as coal mill, boiler operations with the likelihood of hot material exposure, management\n\n## Training through digitalisation\n\nObjective: To proactively address the challenges of worker safety, health, and well-being and to achieve our organisational goal of 'Zero Harm'.\n\nEfforts: Explanatory Virtual Reality (VR)-enabled immersive training modules, that seamlessly guide workers through simulation of highrisk activities, was chosen for this purpose. The features were:\n\n- \u00b7 Use of computer modelling and simulation that enables a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3D) visual hazard, interact with it, understand its risks and consequences and ultimately, learn the safest way of doing the activity to avoid any negative consequences.\n\nof change and electrical arc flash. These were uploaded onto our LMS platform, and we made it mandatory for all employees involved in these operations to qualify through a test after completing the courses. Around 5000 employees have completed these courses.\n\n## Virtual training sessions\n\nVirtual training sessions were organised around the four fatal risk prevention elements, namely Work at Height, Conveyor Safety, Electrical Safety, and Hot Material Safety, for our contractual workforce. The sessions were conducted in Hindi and other regional languages, and we have covered approximately 14,000 contractual workers to date.\n\n## Classroom training sessions\n\nWe provided classroom safety training to 1,800 supervisors of contractors across all our Units.\n\n- \u00b7 To address 'At-Risk behaviour' to inform contract workmen about workplace hazards and associated risks.\n- \u00b7 Each module (4-5 minutes) has various steps, including the dos and Don'ts of the task.\n\nAt the end of the training, users assess about the understanding of the task and the system generates automatic reports.\n\n## Key highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Over 14,000 workers on 30 different VR modules have been trained and evaluated.\n- \u00b7 Lost time injuries have decreased by 50%.\n- \u00b7 Fatal risk prevention related LTIs have decreased by 37%.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR) has reduced by 45%.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through a structured six-step process, we aim to promote positive safety behaviour, correct risky behaviour, and engage in safety conversations. Regular behaviour-based safety training programmes are also conducted, and a consequence management procedure has been instated to deter any alarming behaviours. We also institutionalised a Reward and Recognition programme to reinforce positive safety behaviour.\n\n## Safety on the road\n\nWe have implemented a road and driving safety standard that covers vehicle, driver, and road safety. We evaluate compliance with these standards periodically through internal and external audits, and corrective actions are taken for non-compliance. The Plant Logistics Head (PLH) is responsible for ensuring road safety at our Units. We hold regular meetings with transporters to review road safety performance and ensure that they follow our road safety norms.\n\n## Safer through technology\n\nWe have implemented various measures to ensure safe driving practices at our cement plants. Our cement trucks are equipped with GPS technology to monitor driving behaviour and counsel drivers regarding improvement. All new drivers and contract workers undergo safety induction to educate them on our safety system requirements. We have developed a truck yard management plan, conduct driver awareness initiatives, provide training on defensive driving and first aid, and organised health camps for drivers.\n\n## Rail safety\n\nWe have trained 544 individuals, including employees and contract workers, who are involved in rail yard-related activities across our Units on rail safety. This training was conducted by an external expert.\n\n## Safety at Ready-Mix Concrete Plants\n\nWe are dedicated to bolstering the safety culture at our 230+ strategically located ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants, to tackle the high attrition levels and low safety awareness among our skilled workforce of nearly 8,000 people. All RMC sites follow our safety standards, and regular training on established safety protocols is provided. We use our Train the Trainer (TtT) module for training and also impart defensive driving skills to transit mixer drivers. An animated training module helps concrete workers safely use the concrete pump, and arc flash suits are mandatory. Our senior leadership conducts surprise audits of the RMC plants.",

This led to numerous challenges, including women spending three hours daily fetching water, resulting in health issues and safety hazards. Additionally, it exacerbated problems such as domestic violence, limited access to education, poor health, and unsanitary living conditions. Shockingly, the study also revealed that 30-35% of girls had dropped out of school due to the consequences of water deficiency. The project was implemented after extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including SelfHelp Group women members, village Panchayats, and community leaders.\n\nWe have successfully constructed 183 (165) check dams, 75 (69) rainwater harvesting structures, soak pits, and large ponds. This year, our efforts extended to Dhar, Maihar, and Khor in Madhya Pradesh, Malkhed in Karnataka, Tadipatri in Andhra Pradesh, and Baga in Himachal Pradesh.

The programme revolves around three key goals: revitalising the village economy using a watershed approach, promoting sustainable livelihoods through organic farming and organic by-product preparation. Gothans are managed by the Gothan committee and women-led Self-Help Groups (SHGs), producing various farm and offfarm products such as vermicompost, NADEP compost, vermiwash, and biopesticides.\n\nThis initiative not only generates income through sustainable means but also encourages local self-governance, restores village commons, and provides opportunities for vulnerable and marginalised communities through economic programmes and schemes. Villages receive training on integrated farming methods, organic manure preparation, and biopesticide production utilising local resources. Additionally, they cultivate climate-resilient seasonal vegetables, minor millets (such as Ragi) and turmeric. Women are trained to produce various products like Ragi powder, turmeric powder, guava jam, soaps from natural ingredients, and cow dung products for sale in the local market. Mushroom cultivation and off-farm activities are also promoted among women farmers.",

This positive change has enabled farmers in the region to cultivate watermelons, a longer duration crop well-suited for the sandy loam soil of Karnataka. The watermelon seeds are typically sown in November, and within 60 days, small fruits start appearing on the vines. As the warm summer months progress, these fruits continue to grow. The farmers are delighted by the abundance of watermelons, which serve not only\n\nas a source of food but also as a refreshing drink and even a means to wash their faces.\n\nTo further enhance crop yields, a 'mulching system' was introduced in collaboration with Krishi Vigyan Kendra. This innovative technique has resulted in a significant fourfold increase in yield. Previously, farmers like Shri. Rudramani, who owned three acres of land, relied on short-duration crops like fenugreek seeds and tomatoes that provided limited income. However, with the implementation of the mulching system, Rudramani now harvests approximately 50 tonnes per acre.\n\n## 242 Lakhs\n\nCATTLE VACCINATED AGAINST LUMPY VIRUS\n\nWORTH ASSETS OF DIARY FARMERS SAVED\n\n## 100 Cows\n\nSAVED WITH TIMELY MEDICINE ADMINISTRATION OF LUMPY DISEASE\n\nTo assist the farmers in selling their sweet watermelons, Rajashree Cement established a dedicated shop corner called 'Sweet Summertime.'

The IMF projects that in a plausible alternative scenario with further financial sector stress, global growth could decline to about 2.5% in 2023 with advanced economy growth falling below 1.0%. Global inflation is expected to fall from 8.7% in 2022 to 7.0% in 2023 and 4.9% in 2024, which is yet above pre-COVID-19 pandemic range of average 3.5% between 2017 and 2019. Elevated interest rates, financial sector stress compelling central banks to reconsider policy actions, and the war in Ukraine continue to weigh on global economic activity.\n\nOver the next two years India is projected to be the fastestgrowing major economy, as IMF projects India's GDP growth at 5.9% and 6.3% during 2023 and 2024 respectively, which is expected to surpass China's 5.2% and 4.5% GDP growth in the same period. This is despite the three shocks of COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and central banks across economies led by the US Federal Reserve responding with synchronised policy rate hikes to curb inflation, leading to appreciation of the US dollar and the widening of Current Account Deficits in net importing economies.\n\nThe Indian economy appears to have moved on after its encounter with the pandemic, staging a full recovery in FY22 ahead of many nations and positioning itself to ascend to the pre-pandemic growth path in FY23. Yet in the current year, India has also faced the challenge of reining in inflation that the European strife accentuated. Measures taken by the government and the Reserve Bank of India ('RBI'), along with the easing of global commodity prices, finally managed to bring retail inflation below the RBI upper tolerance target in March 2023. In the process of arresting rising inflation, during FY23, the RBI hiked interest rates by 2.5% in six tranches.\n\nIndia's economic growth is expected to be brisk in FY24, as a vigorous credit disbursal and capital investment cycle is expected to unfold in India with the strengthening of balance sheets in the corporate and banking sectors. Direct tax revenue collections have been highly buoyant and so have GST collections, which should ensure the full expending of the Capex budget within the budgeted fiscal deficit. Further, support to economic growth will come from the expansion of public digital platforms and path-breaking measures such as PM GatiShakti, the National Logistics Policy, and the Production-Linked Incentive ('PLI') schemes to boost manufacturing output.\n\nThe capital expenditure initiatives of the central government are another growth driver of the Indian economy. A sustained increase in private Capex is imminent with the strengthening of the balance sheets of corporates and the consequent increase in credit financing it has been able to generate. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme ('MGNREGS') has been directly providing jobs in",

Schemes like PM-Kisan and PM Garib Kalyan Yojana have helped in ensuring food security in the country.\n\nDespite strong global headwinds and tighter domestic monetary policy, the IMF expects India to grow around 5.9% in 2023. This growth, without the advantage of a base effect, reflects India's underlying economic resilience - its ability to recoup, renew, and re-energise the growth drivers of the economy. India's economic resilience can be seen in the domestic stimulus to growth seamlessly replacing the external stimuli. Structural reforms implemented by the government have resulted in ease of doing business.\n\nThe release of Urban Real Estate demand was reflected in the housing market too as demand for housing loans picked up. At ' 19,36,428 crores at the end of March 2023, outstanding housing loans have grown by an absolute 14.9% and 42.2% compared to a respective ' 16,84,424 crores a year ago and ' 13,61,880 crores at the end of March 2020. Consequently, housing inventories have declined, prices are firming up, and construction of new dwellings is picking up pace, and this has stimulated innumerable backward and forward linkages that the construction sector is known to carry. The universalisation of COVID-19 vaccination coverage also has a significant role in lifting the housing market as, in its absence, the migrant workforce could not have returned to construct new dwellings.\n\nApart from housing, construction activity, in general, has significantly risen in FY23 as the much-enlarged capital budget of the central government and its public sector enterprises is rapidly being deployed.\n\n## Cement Industry during FY23\n\nThe country's cement demand is expected to climb by around 10% over fiscal year 2023, as reported by a leading ratings agency. The growing housing sector, which typically accounts for 60% to 65% of India's cement consumption, will remain a key demand driver. Also, continued large investments in roads and infrastructure projects will fuel cement demand.\n\nIn the Union Budget 2023-24, the government has allocated US $1.8 billion for the creation of safe housing, clean drinking water, and sanitation, and increasing road and telecom connectivity, among other initiatives. The government has also allocated US $9.6 billion to address housing shortages. As per a post-budget report by a research affiliate of a credit rating agency, cement demand is expected to witness third straight year of growth with a 7% to 9% jump to ~425 million tonnes in FY24. In FY24, infrastructure and affordable rural housing segments are expected to propel growth, where the highest traction is expected from roads, where the total annual outlay for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the National Highways Authority of India ('NHAI') has seen an increase of 25% and 14%, respectively. The government has also increased budget outlay for affordable rural housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana - Gramin ('PMAY-G') by 12.5% for FY24. Launched in 2015, PMAY-G is part of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana ('PMAY'), a massive government scheme promoting affordable housing in India.\n\nIt is against this backdrop, that we share your Company's performance during FY23.",

The lower operating margin was attributable to higher input costs, partly offset by volume growth and better sales realisations.\n\n## Cost Highlights\n\n## i. Energy Cost\n\nOverall energy costs increased by 36% from ' 1,240/t to ' 1,692/t mainly due to higher fuel prices.\n\n## ii. Input Material Costs\n\nRaw material costs rose from ' 531/t to ' 600/t because of an increase in additive and fly ash prices. Increase in diesel prices impacted inbound transportation and mining costs, resulting in higher raw material costs. Your Company is continuously working on improving the share of blended and premium products in its product mix, which is expected to result in an improvement in overall profitability.\n\n## iii. Freight and Forwarding Expenses\n\nLogistics costs increased marginally from ' 1,214/t to ' 1,248/t due to an increase in diesel cost as well as business season surcharges levied on railway freight. Reduction in lead distance mainly on account of a change in the market mix and synergies arising out of the integration of acquired assets aided in lowering the impact of rising diesel costs.\n\n## Employee Costs\n\nEmployee costs increased to ' 2,562 crores as compared to ' 2,359 crores in the previous year, primarily due to the annual increments.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nAt ' 2,619 crores, depreciation was higher by ' 162 crores, on account of capitalisation of new capacities during the year.\n\n## Finance Cost\n\nRepayment of borrowings led to a decrease in finance costs from ' 798 crores to ' 755 crores. However, an increase in the interest rate impacted interest costs.\n\nYour Company does not accept any fixed deposits from the public falling under Section 73 of the Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act') and the Companies (Acceptance of Deposits) Rules, 2014.\n\n## Credit Rating\n\nYour Company has adequate liquidity and a strong balance sheet. CRISIL and India Ratings and Research reaffirmed their credit rating as CRISIL AAA/Stable and IND AAA/ Stable for Long Term and CRISIL A1+ and IND A1+ for Short Term, respectively. Further, CARE Ratings has rated the long-term borrowings as CARE AAA/Stable and short-term borrowings as CARE A1+.\n\nYour Company has also obtained its credit rating for its foreign currency bond issuances from Fitch and Moody's and has been rated by them as BBB- and Baa3, respectively.\n\nThis is a testament to your Company's sound financial management as well as its ability to service financial obligations in a timely manner.\n\n## Income Tax\n\nNormalised income tax expenses increased in line with an increase in taxable income.\n\n## Net Profit\n\nNormalised PAT decreased by 11% from ' 5,549 crores to ' 4,917 crores.\n\n## Significant changes in key financial ratios, along with detailed explanations:\n\n| Particulars                    |   FY23 |   FY22 | % Change   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Debtors Turnover (Days)        |  18    |  18    | -          |\n| Inventory Turnover (Days)      |  34    |  33    | (4)        |\n| Interest Coverage Ratio        |  12.6  |  12.72 | (1)        |\n| Current Ratio                  |   1.21 |   1.3  | (7)        |\n| Debt Equity Ratio (Gross)      |   0.17 |   0.2  | (18)       |\n| Debt Equity Ratio (Net)        |   0.03 |   0.07 | (53)       |\n| Operating Profit Margin (%)    |  16.4  |  22    | (25)       |\n| Net Profit Margin (%)          |   8.1  |  11.2  | (27)       |\n| Return on Net Worth (%)        |   9.3  |  11.3  | (18)       |\n| Return on Capital Employed (%) |  12.1  |  14.4  | (16)       |\n| Earnings Per Share (EPS)       | 171    | 192    | (11)       |\n\n## Detailed explanation of ratios\n\n- I.

The ratio shows how well a company uses and manages the credit it extends to customers. The ratio is calculated by dividing average trade receivables by average per day turnover.\n- II. Inventory  Turnover (Days) represents the average number of days a company holds its inventory before selling it. It is calculated by dividing average inventory by average per day turnover.\n- III. Interest Coverage Ratio measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payment with its available earnings. It is calculated by dividing PBIT by finance cost. Your Company's Interest Coverage Ratio decreased by 1% over the previous year mainly on account of lower PAT during the year.\n- IV. Current  Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by current liabilities (excluding current borrowings).\n- V. Debt  Equity  Ratio is used to evaluate a company's financial leverage. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is financing its operations through debt versus wholly owned funds. It is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder's equity. Your Company's Debt Equity Ratio (Net) has improved by 18% mainly on account of reduction in debt during the year.\n- VI. Operating Profit Margin (%) is a profitability or performance ratio used to calculate the percentage of profit a company generates from its operations. It is calculated by dividing the PBIDT (excluding Other Income) by turnover. Your Company's Operating Profit Margin decreased by 25% mainly on account of higher costs, partly set off by higher volume and higher realisations during the year.\n- VII. Net Profit Margin (%) is equal to how much net income or profit is generated as a percentage of revenue. It is calculated by dividing the profit for the year by turnover. Your Company's Net Profit Margin decreased by 27% mainly on account of higher costs and was partly set off by higher volume, higher realisations and lower interest outgo during the year.\n- VIII. Return on Net Worth ('RONW') is a measure of profitability of a company expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by dividing Net Profit from continuing operations for the year by average Net Worth during the year.\n- IX. Return on Capital Employed ('ROCE') is a financial ratio that measures a company's profitability and\n\n- the efficiency with which its capital is used. In other words, the ratio measures how well a company is generating profits from its capital. It is calculated by dividing profit before interest, exceptional items, and tax by average capital employed during the year.\n- X. Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each share. It serves as an indicator of a company's profitability. It is calculated by dividing profit for the year by weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year. For your Company, the EPS decreased on account of reduction in Net Profit by 11.4% over that of the previous year.\n\n## Cash Flow Statement\n\n|                                                          | FY23   | '  in crores) FY22   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------|\n| Sources of Cash                                          |        |                      |\n| Cash from Operations                                     | 8,789  | 9,237                |\n| Non-operating Cash Flow                                  | 482    | 286                  |\n| Proceeds from Issue of Share Capital                     | 5      | 4                    |\n| (Increase) / Decrease in Working Capital                 | 559    | (567)                |\n| Total                                                    | 9,835  | 8,960                |\n| Uses of Cash                                             |        |                      |\n| Net Capital Expenditure                                  | 5,831  | 5,422                |\n| (Redemption) / Increase in Investments                   | 529    | (7,734)              |\n| Investment in Subsidiaries, Joint Ventures,              | 875    | 1,809                |\n| Associates, and Others                                   |        |                      |\n| Repayment of Borrowings (Net)                            | 360    | 7,360                |\n| Repayment of Lease Liability including  Interest thereof | 167    | 160                  |\n| Purchase / (Sale or Issue) of Treasury Shares  (Net)     | 106    | 83                   |\n| Interest                                                 | 650    | 838                  |\n| Dividend                                                 | 1,091  | 1,065                |\n| Total                                                    | 9,610  | 9,002                |\n\n## Sources of Cash\n\n## Cash from Operations\n\nCash from operations was lower compared to the previous year due to the rise in costs, which was partly set-off by higher volume and sales realisation.\n\n## Non-Operating Cash Flow\n\nCash from other activities was higher on account of increased interest income on bank deposits and intercorporate deposits.\n\n## Increase in Working Capital\n\nIncrease in working capital is attributed to increase in inventories and trade receivables on account of inflationary impact on fuel inventory and higher sales, respectively.",

Finally, the Occupational Health and Safety ('OHS') Board, chaired by the Managing Director and Head of Manufacturing, reviews organisational safety performance once every two months, and a further course of action is communicated across units.\n\n## Building Competence\n\nAround 750,000 man-hours of safety training were organised across units during the year.\n\nA brief description of the various safety training elements are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Standard Champions training: to build a pool of competent in-house resource as trainers, 500 employees across all units were trained on 18 safety standards through the 'Standard Champions training' programme.\n- \u00b7 VR-enabled safety training on 30 modules was organised for contract workmen and employees at units to ensure that job-specific immersive training is provided to each contract workman before deploying them to the job. VR puts learners in places and situations they are likely to encounter on the job and allows them to experience how their actions affect outcomes, all in a safe environment. Around 12,000 persons were trained during the year.\n- \u00b7 E-learning modules on critical processes (such as use of a coal mill or boiler, operations involving the likelihood of hot material exposure, and the management of change) were developed and uploaded to the learning management system ('LMS') platform. The system was institutionalised so that all employees involved in these operations needed to mandatorily get themselves qualified through tests after going through these courses. Around 5,000 employees completed these courses during the year.\n\n- \u00b7 Virtual training sessions in Hindi as well as regional languages were organised for the contractual workforce on four fatal risk prevention elements: working at height, conveyor safety, electrical safety, and hot material safety. Around 14,000 contractual workers covered so far.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 544 persons (employees and contract workers) engaged in rail yard related activities across units have been trained on rail safety by an external expert.\n- \u00b7 Classroom safety training has been imparted to 1,800 contractor's supervisors across all units.\n\n## Facilitating Adherence to Safety\n\n- \u00b7 Monthly safety campaign, driven by identified themes (based on analysis of past incidents): Multiple activities/events are organised and supported by a variety of mediums (3D animation video, creative posters, training through virtual platform etc.) to reach out to all.\n- \u00b7 Safety toll-free number (available 24/7): As a deterrent against safety violations, an exclusive safety toll-free number has been made available with communication to every person (employee/contract worker) so that they can act as whistleblowers to save lives. The concerns voiced are addressed, keeping the caller's identity anonymous.\n- \u00b7 60 seconds to think: This involves seven questions that have to be asked by each individual before initiating any work. They must sign this and submit it along",

It also facilitates the ability of any contract worker to say 'no' if they feel they are not safe to execute the work or are not convinced that the conditions to execute the work may cause an accident.\n\n- \u00b7 Safety behaviour observation: Safety observation-a structured, pro-active six-step process-is in place to achieve positive change in people's behaviour towards safety in the workplace. It aims to i) recognise and reinforce positive safety behaviour, ii) identify and correct behaviour at risk, and iii) engage in conversation regarding safety concerns or issues. During the year, over 4,00,000 observations were reported through this across units.\n- \u00b7 Digitisation of walk-through inspection (WTI): A latitude-longitude-based unique QR code was generated for each of around 50 locations of a unit. By scanning the specified section's QR code, the user can view the WTI checklist of the section and report findings by using the 'speech-to-text' feature. Around 300,000 findings were reported through WTI and closed during the year across all units.\n- \u00b7 20 Pictorial Standard Operating Procedures ('SOPs') in Hindi - with less text and more visuals displayed at relevant locations for contractual workers to easily understand and follow.\n- \u00b7 30 3D-animated videos in English and Hindi on past serious incidents are shown at units for easy understanding by employees and contractual workers about how and why those happened, to prevent recurrence.\n- \u00b7 A Behavioural Science-Based Safety ('BSBS') program was launched to address the psychological issue of contractual workforce towards safety.\n- \u00b7 With the on-going capacity expansions, safety at project sites pose their own challenges on account of timelines for execution and contract workmen attrition. To give more thrust towards safe execution of projects, multilayer monitoring was introduced which is over and above the existing safety management practices at your Company. Apart from respective project HRC and Apex committees, safety experts were deployed at the sites. Additionally, expert rigger and scaffolding experts were placed at each project site to support safe execution.\n\n## Verifying Compliance\n\n- \u00b7 Assurance: An independent safety assessment was carried out by a third-party expert agency to evaluate the degree of compliance to 17 safety standards (as applicable) across of your Company. The result of this\n\nassessment has been shared with units to enable them take corrective actions. The minimum score improved from 53% in FY22 to 72% in FY23.\n\n- \u00b7 Safety audit: Around 4,000 observations reported through first party safety audit (FPSA) across units were closed. In addition, 8,000 contractor field safety audits were carried out across units during the year. Safety audits at 62 RMC plants by safety professionals of nearby manufacturing units identified 1,825 findings, all of which were subsequently closed.\n- \u00b7 ' \u0939\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0906\u092a\u0915\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0939 \u0939 \u0948 - Contractor Connect Initiative': Unit Heads/Function Heads engage through weekly sessions with contractors and workers to verify adherence to safety norms while at work. This has been continued for 84 weeks so far since launch.\n\n## Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nIn terms of the provisions of Section 135 of the Act read with the Companies (Corporate Social Responsibility Policy) Rules, 2014, the Board of Directors of your Company has constituted a Corporate Social Responsibility ('CSR') Committee, chaired by Mrs. Rajashree Birla.

The policy on Related Party Transactions, as approved by the Audit Committee and the Board, is available at https://www.ultratechcement.com/investors/ corporate-governance#policies.\n\nThe details of contracts and arrangements with related parties of your Company for the financial year ended 31 st March, 2023, is provided in Note No. 38 to the standalone financial statements of your Company.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nYour Company recognises that every business encompasses risks that need timely intervention and management. To achieve the ambitious business goals in a challenging and dynamic environment, your Company is committed to proactively managing risks. While risks can never be eliminated, effective risk management can help in avoiding, mitigating, transferring, or accepting the associated impacts of risks.\n\nAt your Company, the Risk Management and Sustainability Committee ('RMS Committee') is responsible for overseeing your Company's risks. It reviews the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, analyses risks in depth, and defines mitigation actions where necessary. Your Company aims to assess and prioritise risks based on their significance in terms of impact and likelihood, considering the business environment, operational controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nYour Company has identified several key risks, including economic environment and market demand; inflation and costs of production; legal and compliance; financial; environment; climate and sustainability; information technology; and talent management. Your Company considers the risk horizons, which includes longterm strategic risks, short to medium-term risks, and single events. The risks are analysed based on their likelihood and impact to determine the appropriate risk management strategy.\n\n## Key Business Risks identified by your Company:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic Environment and Market Demand\n\nThe demand for construction material is driven by the economic growth in the country. Economic slowdown and subdued infrastructural development might lead to a slowdown in construction projects, thus leading to a reduction in cement consumption in the country. In a scenario where incremental capacity addition exceeds incremental cement demand, the government's push for infrastructure and housing will aid the growth in cement consumption.\n\nGiven that the cement industry in India is an aggregation of small and large companies, the risk of protecting market share in such environment is optimal for your Company. With the expanding capacities of existing players and the emergence of new entrants, competition is a sustained risk. To mitigate this, continuous endeavours to enhance brand equity through innovative marketing activities, enhancement in the product portfolio, and value-add services have been the thrust areas for your Company. The engineering expertise of your Company and its emphasis on quality also act as a significant counter measure to the risk of market fluctuations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Inflation and Cost of Production\n\nYour Company faces the risk of inflation and price fluctuations in the cost of coal, pet coke, power, and other fuels, since these are market-driven. The cement industry is extremely energy intensive, and changes in fuel prices can significantly impact production cost. To de-risk, your Company has established specific policies of long-term contracts, and it continuously optimises its fuel mix and energy efficiency, while exploring the use of alternative fuels.\n\nThe procurement of raw materials at an economical cost or of suitable quality faces a high degree of inflationary certainty. Your Company mitigates this risk through the establishment of exhaustive policies for procurement of specific raw materials and stores those which are amenable to just-in-time inventories.",

Your Company currently possesses sufficient limestone reserves. However, securing additional reserves is critical to address your Company's expansion plans. Apart from the preservation and extension of existing reserves, a range of measures, including strategic sourcing and changing input-mix, are adopted by your Company to mitigate the risk of unavailability of limestone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nThis risk relates to any inadvertently violated laws covering business conduct. The country's regulatory framework is ever-evolving, and the risk of noncompliance and penalties may increase for your Company, leading to reputational risks. A comprehensive risk-based compliance programme, involving inclusive training and adherence to the Code of Conduct, is thus institutionalised by your Company. As a step to mitigate the legal and compliance risk, your Company's management encourages its employees to place their reliance on professional guidance and opinions to discuss the impact of any changes in laws and regulations to ensure total compliance. Periodic and ad hoc reporting to various internal committees for oversight ensures the effectiveness of such a programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial\n\nThis comprises the risk of exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. The risk management strategy is to identify the risk exposure, measure and evaluate the financial impact, and decide on steps to mitigate the risks together with ensuring regular monitoring and reporting.\n\nWith the objective of minimising risks arising from the uncertainty and volatility of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, an elaborate financial risk management policy is followed for every transaction undertaken in foreign currency. Your Company's policies to counter such risks are reviewed periodically and constantly aligned with the financial market practices and regulations.\n\nChanging laws, rules, regulations, and standards relating to accounting, corporate governance, public disclosure, and listing regulations are generating newer and unforeseen\n\nrisks for companies. The new or changed laws, regulations, and standards may lack precedence and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. Thus, your Company maintains a high standard of corporate governance and public disclosure to de-risk itself from such dynamic regulatory changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environment\n\nEnvironmental risk pertains to the harm caused to the environment by pollution resulting from waste discharge and greenhouse gas emissions. To prevent this, your Company's operating units are equipped with Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems ('CEMS') in the major stacks and monitored in real-time by the Central Pollution Control Board ('CPCB') and State Pollution Control Boards ('SPCBs'). The units have been in compliance with the regulations of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change ('MoEF&CC'), and no major deviation has been observed.\n\nIn addition to CEMS, third-party environment monitoring is regularly carried out by laboratories which are approved by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories ('NABL'), and the results are further substantiated by monitoring carried out by SPCBs.\n\nRegular measures are being taken to maintain the performance efficiency of Pollution Control Equipment at all the units. This year, the performance efficiency study of Air Pollution Control Devices ('APCDs') in the units was carried out by NCCBM. Internal environmental audits are also conducted to ensure that the emissions are kept within or lower than the limits for the APCDs on a regular basis.\n\nFor better control of fugitive emissions, your Company has initiated an emission inventory dispersion modelling study for one of its units by the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai. Your Company has also constructed covered sheds for various raw materials and fuels at some units and concreted new roads at others.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate and Sustainability\n\nYour Company has analysed climate change-related risks in its operations, including the physical and transition risks it entails, which are aligned with the Task Force on",

The following climate-related risks have been identified:\n\n## Physical Risks\n\n- \u00b7 Acute physical risks arising from longer-term changes in climate patterns causing damage to assets or supply chain disruption, such as floods, heat waves, cyclones, and droughts.\n- \u00b7 Chronic physical risks such as variations in temperature, precipitation patterns, and water stress.\n- \u00b7 Transitional risks emerging from the transition to low-carbon business pathways that involve regulatory changes, technology, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change.\n\nYour Company has developed a risk mitigation strategy against each climate risk, summarised as follows;\n\nAcute physical risks: Your Company diligently implements disaster management plans, health and safety protocols, and adequate communication protocols during extreme weather events to ensure site safety and minimise the impact on the workforce. Annual weather forecasts are being considered in global supply chain decisions to mitigate the risk of delays in sourcing fuels and machinery due to natural calamities. Insurance coverage is in place to protect against damages to business assets or loss of materials in warehouses or transit due to extreme weather events.\n\nChronic physical risks: Your Company has proactively installed rainwater harvesting systems across sites. In addition, at several of the manufacturing sites, Zero Liquid Discharge ('ZLD') plants have been installed to enable the reuse of 100% treated water within the sites. As a result, your Company is 4.1 times water positive currently.\n\nMeasures to mitigate the risks of heat waves have been introduced across sites, making your Company resilient to such risks. Some such measures include minimal work in mid-day hours in warehouses or outdoor areas during peak summer days, flexible work hours with early morning and late evening shifts to avoid exposure to heat waves, and compliance to the WASH Pledge (ensuring the availability of drinking water).\n\nTransitional risks: Emerging climate policies and the world carbon market economy could significantly impact companies in the future due to their effects on the supply chain, physical risk, shifting customer preferences, and the transition to a low-carbon economy. Your Company has analysed physical and transitional risks using a scenariobased approach and is aligned with the Representative Concentration Pathway ('RCP'), ETP B2DS, and IPCC 1.5-degree scenarios. Your Company's resilience has been evaluated under scenarios, and potential pathways for decarbonisation have been considered to ensure compliance with policy mechanisms. Some key risks that may have financial implications for the Company are the introduction of carbon pricing in India; the financing community is expected to strengthen its climate-related financing mechanism; non-compliance to meet 1.5 /.notdefC pathway requirements; maturity and viable low carbon technology adoption, among other developments. Your Company has committed to achieving net zero by 2050 and is capable of adapting to new risks arising from climate policy changes by focusing on the green energy transition, enhancing the circular economy, diversifying its low-carbon product portfolio, and participating in new technology development and piloting with global companies in association with the GCCA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Information Technology\n\nThis comprises risks related to Information Technology ('IT') systems, such as data integrity and physical assets. Your Company deploys IT systems, including ERP, SCM, Data Historian, and Mobile Solutions, to support its business processes, communications, sales, logistics, and production. Risks could primarily arise from the unavailability of systems and/or loss or manipulation of information. To mitigate these risks, your Company uses backup procedures and stores information at two different locations. Systems are upgraded regularly with the latest security standards. For critical applications, security policies and procedures are updated periodically, and users are educated on adherence to the policies",

The risks in talent management are mitigated by following a policy of being an employer of choice and instilling a sense of belonging. Specialised training courses are adopted to enhance and reskill employees to prepare them for future roles and create a talent pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Geopolitical Tension\n\nThe rising fuel prices in the wake of geopolitical tensions have had an adverse impact on the cost of manufacturing cement owing to increased raw material, fuel, and energy costs. For your Company's business, raw material, fuel, and logistics account for a major share of the manufacturing cost. The anticipated rise in the procurement of raw materials and high consumption of energy is likely to lead to the need to prioritise local dependence for raw material and energy fulfilment in order to mitigate the disruption caused due to such global geopolitical tension.\n\n## Internal Control Systems and their Adequacy\n\nYour Company has put in place adequate internal control systems that are commensurate with the size of its operations. Policies and procedures related to internal control systems are designed to ensure sound management of your Company's operations, safekeeping of its assets, optimal utilisation of resources, reliability of its financial information, and compliance.

This philosophy / policy is detailed below.\n\n## Aditya Birla Group: Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy\n\nAt the Aditya Birla Group, we expect our executive team to foster a culture of growth and entrepreneurial risk-taking. Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards including incentive programs, retirement benefit programs, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the longterm success of our stakeholders.\n\n## Our business and organisational model\n\nOur Group is a conglomerate and organised in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences.\n\n## I. Objectives of the Executive Remuneration Program\n\nOur executive remuneration program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success and thereby build value for our shareholders.\n\nOur executive remuneration program is intended to:\n\n- 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to our executives on a holistic basis.\n- 2. Emphasize 'Pay for Performance' by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals.\n\n## II. Executives\n\n## Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy applies to the following:\n\n- 1. Directors of the Company.\n- 2. Key Managerial Personnel: Chief Executive Officer and equivalent (eg. Managing Director), Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary.\n- 3. Senior Management: as may be decided by the Board of Directors.\n\n## III. Business and Talent Competitors\n\nWe benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are broadly equitable and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. Secondary reference points bring to the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, to appreciate the differences in levels and medium of pay and build in as appropriate for decision making.\n\n## IV. Executive Pay Positioning\n\nWe aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive payouts at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognise the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning our executives.\n\nWe use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector.\n\n## V. Executive Pay-Mix\n\nOur executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits.\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan:\n\nWe tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We annually align the financial and operational metrics with priorities / focus areas for the business.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive:\n\nOur Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained",

Performance Goal Setting\n\nWe aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic.\n\nThreshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement.\n\nTarget performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance.\n\nMaximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, reflecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.\n\n## VII.   Executive Benefits and Perquisites\n\nOur executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites and benefits plans that commensurate with their roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group.\n\n## Other Remuneration Elements\n\nEach of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies.\n\nWe limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax gross-ups for our executives.\n\n## Risk and Compliance\n\nWe aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as, remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives, uncapped pay- outs, unreasonable goals or thresholds, steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds.\n\n## Claw back Clause\n\nIn an incident of restatement of financial statements, due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made thereunder, we shall recover from our executives, the remuneration received in excess, of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of financial statements, pertaining to the relevant performance year.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination, Remuneration and Compensation Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy / Policy. These services will be established through 'arm's length', agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.",

It is intended to provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements on a holistic basis; emphasise 'pay for performance' by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed business and individual goals.\n\nExecutive pay practices and levels are dynamically tracked and aligned with peer companies in similar industries, geographies, size and function. Your Company aims to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to its executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive payouts at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. It recognises the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning its executives. Your Company uses secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector.\n\nThe remuneration involves a balance between fixed and incentive pay, reflecting short and long-term performance objectives appropriate to the working of your Company and its goals. A material proportion of compensation for senior management is performance based - 25% to 40% of compensation. It increases as the employee grows in the organisation and takes up roles of higher responsibility. The more senior the role, the weightage of business performance on the variable pay also increases in comparison to unit performance and individual performance. This ensures a competitive pay-mix which aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits.\n\nAnnual incentive plan pay-outs of executives is linked to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. Financial and operational metrics are annually aligned with priorities / focus areas for the business. Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as a retention and reward tool. Stock options are used as the primary long-term incentive vehicles as your Company believes that they best align executive incentives with stakeholder interests. Your Company also grants restricted stock units as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain its executives. The ratio of stock options and restricted stock units is generally 75:25.\n\nYour Company has integrated climate change and sustainability targets in the key responsibility areas ('KRAs') of the executive directors and senior management. Thus, emission reduction targets and other improvement targets related to climate change are also linked with the incentives provided.",

The Government of India is soon to hold the G20 Ministerial Conference on Women Empowerment. In this context, EMPOWER is the G20 alliance fixated on empowerment and progression of women's economic representation. A McKinsey report mentions that India can line its GDP up to 18 percent if it can work out ways to bridge the gender equity gap. This is the outcome of envisioning the positive power of women, if their creative potential was tapped to the maximum. Our Government is a signatory to the UNSDG Goals, among which SDG-5 is a commitment to gender equality. Phenomenal steps has been taken to rise up to this goal and assiduously pursue the upliftment of women every which way.\n\nAs you may be aware, G20 Presidency of India is ongoing. Within its frame EMPOWER is championing women led development pivoted on women entrepreneurship, leadership inclusive at all levels, grassroots and above as well as education.

Our constant endeavour is to go on fostering the enabling ecosystem and the inclusive culture that ABGites experience and take pride.\n\nWe are engaged in enriching lives in 9,000 villages pan India, through our multiple CSR initiatives. A call-out of our selective women centered projects:\n\n- \u00b7 More than 20,280 poorest of the poor women in UP were served through livelihood programmes enabled by the Nudge Foundation's Asha Kiran project with our support.\n- \u00b7 Over 14,000 women are employed in our fashion business. These are unlettered and come from villages.\n- \u00b7 Honing skills and training vulnerable communities in different vocations.\n- \u00b7 Strengthening the women farmer community, endeavouring to close the marketing loop and forming women led Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO) on high value agriculture.\n- \u00b7 Setting up watershed management and water harvesting processes towards sustainable livelihood.\n- \u00b7 We have trained 50,000 women in different skills set.\n- \u00b7 We have empowered 45,000 women through the creation of 5,000 SHGs. They are engaged in income generation activities such as tailoring (our uniforms at the manufacturing plants are tailored by the SHG women), also running salons, making masalas, papads and other kitchen condiments, which again are looped back to us besides the local market. Livestock rearing, horticulture and vegetable cultivation, besides toy making are some of the areas, these SHGs specialise in with our handholding on the financial side, helping them access loans.\n- \u00b7 In the domain of education, we reach out to well over 100,000 students through our network of formal (52 schools) and non-formal educational institutes. Of these girls constitute 50%. Furthermore, we foster the cause of the girl child through 52 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas.\n\nIn our journey up until now, in different phases, we have seen women evolve and develop grit and substance, reflecting the triumph of the human spirit.\n\nYour Company is equally committed to unlock the creative potential of women to the optimal, with a clear linkage to the SDG Goals.

The annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read the Company's annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and describe actions applicable under the applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Management's and Board of Directors'/ Trustees' Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs, profit/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the Company/ Trustees of the Trust are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of Company/Trust and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors/ Trustees are responsible for assessing the ability of Company/Trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors/ Trustees either intends to liquidate the Company/Trust or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Board of Directors/ Trustees are responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of Company/Trust.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements of the Trust of the Company to express an opinion on the standalone financial statements.

We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in the section titled 'Other Matter' in this audit report.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Company and Trust included in the standalone financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nThe financial statements of the Trust have been audited by one of the joint auditors of the Company whose report have been furnished to us, and our opinion in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of the Trust, is based solely on the report of such joint auditor.\n\nOur opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## For B S R & Co.

The Company's shares are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India, and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), India, Global Depository Receipts are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Sustainability Linked Bonds are listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.\n\n## 1 (B) Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## (a) Statement of Compliance\n\nThese standalone financial statements (hereinafter referred to as 'financial statements') are prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III notified under Section 133 of Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act''), amendments thereto and other relevant provisions of the Act and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI'), as applicable.\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company at their meeting held on 28th April, 2023.\n\n## (b) Basis of Preparation and Presentation:\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities:\n\n- (i) Derivative Financial Instruments measured at fair value\n- (ii) Certain financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding financial instruments)\n- (iii) Assets held for disposal - measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs on disposal of assets and its value in use.\n- (iv) Employee's Defined Benefit Plan as per actuarial valuation.\n- (v) Assets and liabilities acquired under Business Combination measured at fair value; and\n- (vi) Employee share based payments measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In determining the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\n- (i) The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is the functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\n- (ii) Figures less than ' 50,000 have been shown at actual, wherever statutorily required to be disclosed, all other figures have been rounded off in decimals to the nearest ' in lakhs, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Classification of Assets and Liabilities into Current/ Non-Current\n\nThe Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of Current / NonCurrent classification of its Assets and Liabilities.\n\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, an asset is classified as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be realised, or is intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle; or\n- (ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n- (iii) It is expected to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- (iv) The asset is a cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to",

Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classification.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current only.\n\n## (c) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the assets's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of PPE have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classified as\n\nPPE when they meet the definition of PPE as specified in Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nPPE except freehold land are stated at their cost of acquisition/installation or construction net of accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n\n## Expenditure during construction period:\n\nExpenditure/ Income during construction period (including financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress (CWIP) , and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other Non-Current Assets'.\n\n## (d) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with indefinite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Company.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Company uses different useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic benefits from those classes of assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.",

Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised if such expenditure leads to creation of an asset, otherwise such expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## \u00b7 Intangible Assets acquired separately:\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax / duty credits\n\navailed wherever applicable) and any directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use. The Company determines the amortisation period as the period over which the future economic benefits will flow to the Company after taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale:\n\nThe Company classifies assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through",

This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities held for sale' respectively. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (g) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n\nValued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the finished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\n## \u00b7 Work-in- progress (WIP), finished goods, stockin-trade and trial run inventories:\n\nValued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods, WIP and trial run inventories includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of Stock-in Trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n\n## \u00b7 Waste / Scrap:\n\nWaste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## (i) Employee Share based payments:\n\nEquity- settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is amortised over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equitysettled employee benefits reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on the fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (j) Treasury Shares:\n\nThe Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing the Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing Costs:\n\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost\n\nincurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange difference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (l) Government Grants:\n\nGovernment grants, related to assets, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with Value Added Tax (VAT) / Goods & Services Tax (GST) payment, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nThe benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (m)  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.",

Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.\n\nClaims against the Company where the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in financial statements, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The costs are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to reflect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (o) Revenue Recognition:\n\n## (i) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n- \u00b7 Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration and outgoing taxes on sale. Any amounts receivable from the customer are recognised as revenue after the control over the goods sold are transferred to the customer which is generally on dispatch/delivery of goods.\n- \u00b7 Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Significant financing component Generally, the Company receives shortterm advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n- (ii) Dividend income is accounted for when the right to receive the income is established.\n- (iii) Interest income is recognised using the Effective Interest Method.",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identified asset;\n- (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n## As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected\n\nto be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through profit or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU, or is recorded in Statement of Profit or Loss if the carrying amount of the ROU has been reduced to zero.\n\nLease Liabilities have been presented as separate line and the 'ROU' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classified as financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash flows are classified as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (q) Employee benefits:\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans:\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried",

Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit or Loss when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The Company provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a defined benefit plan, payable to the employees is the based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Company and is in accordance with the Rules of the Company for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements); net interest expense or income; and re-measurement.\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Company's defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the\n\npresent value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Provident Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Company are entitled to receive benefits in respect of provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan, for which both the employees and the Company make monthly contributions at a specified percentage of the covered employees' salary. The contributions as specified under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Company. The Company is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.\n\n## Defined contribution plans:\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits. The Company provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Company are eligible for participation in defined contribution plans such superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Company, since Company has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution.\n\n## Other employee benefits:\n\nA liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured using the projected unit credit method by a qualified independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period, at the present value of the estimated future cash",

With reference to some employees, liability of other fixed long-term employee benefits is recognised at the present value of the future cash outflows expected to be made by the Company.\n\nRemeasurement gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (r) Income Taxes:\n\nIncome Tax expenses comprise current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.\n\nCurrent Tax is measured on the basis of estimated taxable income for the current accounting period in accordance with the applicable tax rates and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax asset are recognised for deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax losses, carry forward of unused tax credits at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the taxable temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credits are in the form of unused tax credits that are carried forward by the Company for a specified period of time, hence it is grouped with Deferred Tax Asset. MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- b) In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nThe Government of India, on September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, inserted a new Section 115BAA in the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides an option to the Company for paying Income Tax at reduced rates as per the provisions/conditions defined in the said section. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions and deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has estimated and applied the lower income tax rate on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realized or settled in the future period when the Company may be subjected to lower tax rate.\n\n## (s) Earnings Per Share:\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is computed by dividing the net profit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.",

At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;\n- \u00b7 exchange differences relating to qualifying effective cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations which are recognised in OCI.\n\n## (u) Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures:\n\nThe Company's investment in its subsidiaries, associates and Joint Ventures are carried at cost net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.\n\nOn disposal of the Investment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (v) Financial Instruments:\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\n## Initial Recognition:\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the tenure of the financial assets or financial liabilities. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price (net of variable consideration).\n\n## Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets\n\nThe Company classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI') or Fair Value through Profit or Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:\n\n- \u00b7 the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and\n- \u00b7 the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\n\n## Amortised Cost:\n\nA financial asset shall be classified and measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are",

For financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Company recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset increases significantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Company's trade receivables do not contain significant financing component and as per simplified approach, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.\n\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities:\n\nThe Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.

The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability de-recognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## Financial Guarantee Contract Liabilities\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities are disclosed in financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\n## (w) Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n\n## (x) Financial liabilities and equity instruments:\n\n## \u00b7 Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of\n\nan entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\n## (y) Derivative financial instruments:\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cashflow hedge.\n\n## (z) Hedge accounting:\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to effective portion as described above are reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial",

Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (aa)  Segment Reporting - Identification of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete financial information is available. Based on the management approach as defined in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (bb)  Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## (cc)  Business Combination and Goodwill:\n\nThe Company applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Company to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when, there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Company determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identified all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identified, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve.

Amount classified as financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## Note 1(C) Key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Company's  financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax\n\nlosses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (iii) Income Taxes:\n\nThe Company calculates income tax expense based on reported income and estimated exemptions / deduction likely available to the Company. The Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Company has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to realised or settled in the future when the Company may be subject to lower tax rate based on the future financials projections.\n\n## (iv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (v) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical benefits and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its longterm nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## (vi) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.",

Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 43.\n\n## (viii) Litigation and contingencies:\n\nThe Company has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management's assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements.\n\n## (ix) Business Combination:\n\n## (a) Fair Valuation of Intangibles:\n\n## Mining Reserve:\n\nThe Company has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Company, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## (b) Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on the size of land parcel.\n\n## Leasehold land:\n\nLeasehold land was valued basis the leasehold interest for the remaining duration of the lease.\n\n## Other Assets:\n\nThe cost approach has been adopted for fair valuing all the assets except vehicles which have been measured at the old book values less depreciation.\n\nThe cost approach includes calculation of replacement cost using price trends applied to historical cost and capitalisation of all the indirect cost, these trends are on the basis of price indices obtained from recognized sources such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)/ Office of Economic Adviser (OEA) or market intelligence. In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## (x) Classification of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Company's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.",

There is no overdue or cost exceed for Projects under Intangible assets under development.\n\n## C) Goodwill\n\nThe Company had acquired cement business of Century Textiles and Industries Limited (Century Business) at an enterprise value of ' 8,387.71 Crores and accounted as per Ind AS 103 - Business Combinations with effect from May 20, 2018 as per order dated July 3, 2019 by National Company Law Tribunal. The Company had recognised a goodwill of ' 2,208.82 Crores based on the difference between the fair value of consideration transferred and fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill acquired under business combinations has been allocated to the acquired business as Cash Generating Unit (CGU). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the recoverable value of a CGU to its carrying value.\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as at March 31, 2023 is ' 2,208.82 Crores (March 31, 2022: ' 2,208.82 Crores) . The recoverable amount of the CGU was determined using a value-in-use calculation. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation include estimated future cash flows for five years, industry trend, growth rates and weighted average cost of capital.\n\nBased on our impairment testing, the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying amount including goodwill. Therefore, no impairment loss was recognized during the year ended March 31, 2023. Sensitivity analysis with 1% change in growth rate and weighted average cost of capital also indicates that no impairment required on carrying amount of goodwill.",

In particular, this exposes the Company to actuarial risk such as adverse salary growth, change in demographic experience, inadequate return on underlying plan assets. This may result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in nature, the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.\n\n## (b) Pension:\n\nThe Company considers pension for some of its employees at senior management based on the period of service and contribution for the Company. There is no material risk associated with this plan.\n\n## (c) Post-Retirement Medical Benefits:\n\nThe Company provides post-retirement medical benefits to certain ex-employees who were transferred under the Scheme of arrangement for acquiring Larsen & Toubro cement business and eligible for such benefits from earlier Company. There is no material risk associated with this plan.\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n| Sr   No  Particulars   | Sr   No  Particulars                                                | As at March 31, 2023   | As at March 31, 2023   | As at March 31, 2023   | As at March 31, 2022                                 | As at March 31, 2022   | As at March 31, 2022               |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                        |                                                                     | Gratuity  (Funded)     |                        | Pension                | Post-Retirement  Medical Benefits Gratuity  (Funded) | Pension                | Post -Retirement  Medical Benefits |\n| (i)                    | Change in defined benefit obligation                                |                        |                        |                        |                                                      |                        |                                    |\n|                        | Balance at the beginning of the year                                | 733.73                 | 5.63                   | 0.56                   | 671.71                                               | 6.18                   | 0.56                               |\n|                        | Adjustment of:                                                      |                        |                        |                        |                                                      |                        |                                    |\n|                        | Current Service Cost                                                | 53.34                  | -

The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of financial instruments are:\n\n- Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n- Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company specific estimates. The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n- Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.",

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company's operations. The Company's principal financial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Company's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity fixed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The sources of risks that the Company is exposed to and their management is given below:\n\n| Risk   | Exposure Arising From                                                                                     | Measurement                                                                  | Management                                                                                |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| I)     | Market Risk                                                                                               |                                                                              |                                                                                           |\n|        | A)    Foreign  Committed commercial  transaction                                                          | Cash Flow Forecasting                                                        | (a)   Forward foreign exchange contracts (b)   Foreign currency options                   |\n|        | Currency Risk                                                                                             | Financial asset and Liabilities not  denominated in INR Sensitivity Analysis | (c)   Principal only/Currency swaps                                                       |\n|        | B)   Interest Rate  Risk Long Term Borrowings at variable  rates                                          | Sensitivity Analysis,  Interest rate movements                               | (a)   Interest Rate swaps, Coupon only swaps (b)   Portfolio Diversification              |\n|        | C)    Commodity  Price Risk Movement in prices of  commodities mainly Imported  Thermal Coal and Pet Coke | Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price  tracking                             | (a)   Commodity Fixed Prices (b)   Swaps/Options                                          |\n| II)    | Credit Risk Trade receivables, Investments,  Derivative Financial instruments,  Loans and Bank balances   | Ageing analysis, Credit  Rating                                              | (a)   Diversification of mutual fund  investments, (b)   Credit limit & credit worthiness |\n|        |                                                                                                           |                                                                              | (c)   Criteria based approval process                                                     |\n| III)   | Liquidity Risks Borrowings and Other Liabilities  and Liquid Investments                                  | Rolling cash flow  forecasts                                                 | (a)   Adequate unused credit lines and  borrowing facilities                              |\n\nThe Company has standard operating procedures and investment policy for deployment of surplus liquidity, which allows investment in debt securities, fixed deposits and mutual fund schemes of debt categories only and restricts the exposure in equity markets.Compliances of these policies and principles are reviewed by the internal auditors/internal risk management committee on periodical basis.\n\nThe Corporate Treasury team updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis about the implementation of the above policies. It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Company on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## (I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.",

The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials and spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps, options and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2023   | '  in Crores March 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Trade Receivables                                     |                  |                               |\n| USD                                                   | 0.41             | 1.29                          |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                               |\n| USD                                                   | 37.59            | 22.93                         |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.40             | 0.62                          |\n| Others                                                | 0.15             | 0.46                          |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                               |\n| USD                                                   | 40.00            | 40.00                         |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                               |\n| USD                                                   | 34.92            | 25.14                         |\n| LKR                                                   | 0.65             | 0.65                          |\n\n## Foreign currency sensitivity on unhedged exposure:\n\n100 bps increase in foreign exchange rates will have the following impact on profit before tax.\n\n| Particulars   | As at   March 31, 2023   |   '  in Crores As at   March 31, 2022 |\n|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| USD           | -                        |                                  0.17 |\n| LKR           | 0.03                     |                                  0.02 |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps profit will decrease by an equal amount.\n\n## (B) Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company's borrowing with floating interest rates. For all long-term borrowings with floating rates, the risk of variation in the interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. The Company constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to achieve an optimal maturity profile and financing cost.\n\n## Interest rate exposure:\n\n| Particulars                | Total Borrowings   | Floating Rate Borrowings   | Fixed Rate Borrowings   | '  in Crores Non-Interest Bearing Borrowings   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| INR Borrowing              | 5,463.54           | 240.00                     | 4,908.55                | 314.99                                         |\n| USD Borrowing              | 3,286.80           | -                          | 3,286.80                | -                                              |\n| Total as at March 31, 2023 | 8,750.34           | 240.00                     | 8,195.35                | 314.99                                         |\n| INR Borrowing              | 6,859.41           | 383.84                     | 6,129.02                | 346.55                                         |\n| USD Borrowing              | 3,031.70           | -                          | 3,031.70                | -                                              |\n| Total as at March 31, 2022 | 9,891.11           | 383.84                     | 9,160.72                | 346.55                                         |\n\nNote: Interest rate risk hedged for Foreign Currency borrowings has been shown under Fixed Rate borrowings",

Since the Energy costs is one of the primary costs drivers, any adverse fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Company enters into fixed price swaps/other derivatives for imported coal, enter into long-term supply agreement for pet coke, identifying new sources of supply etc. While fixed price swaps/ other derivatives are available in the markets for coal but in case of pet coke no such derivative is available; it has to be procured at spot prices. Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and fuel requirement are monitored by the central procurement team.",

Ind AS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements.\n- 2. Ind AS 12 - Income Taxes: The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n- 3. Ind AS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty.\n\nThe Company is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.\n\nSignatures to Note '1' to '59'\n\nIn terms of our report of even date attached.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\nFor B S R & Co.

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint venture in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of the one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) and (b) of the 'Other Matters' section below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matters\n\n- (a) We draw attention to Note 37(b) of the consolidated financial statements which refers to orders dated 31 August 2016 (Penalty of Rs. 1,449.51 crores) and 19 January 2017 (Penalty of Rs.68.30 crores) of the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which the Company had filed appeal. Upon the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT') disallowing its appeal against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, the Company has filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, the Company has deposited an amount of Rs. 144.95 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of Rs. 1,449.51 crores recorded as asset. The Company, backed by legal opinions, believes that it has a good case in both the matters basis which no provision has been recognised in the books of account. Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.\n- (b) We draw attention to Note 37(b) of the consolidated financial statements, where in case of UltraTech Nathdwara Cement Limited ('UNCL'), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent, one of the joint auditors of the Company has audited the financial statements and without modifying their opinion on the audited consolidated financial statements of UNCL for the year ended 31 March 2023 reported that the Order dated 31 August 2016 (penalty of Rs. 167.32 crores) was passed by the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which UNCL had filed appeal. Upon the NCLAT disallowing its appeal against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, UNCL filed an appeal before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, UNCL has deposited an amount of Rs. 16.73 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of Rs. 167.32 crores recorded as asset in the consolidated financial statements. Based on the legal opinion obtained",

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of reports of the one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors on separate/consolidated financial statements of components audited by them, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the appropriateness of this assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint venture to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial statements/financial information of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint venture to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements/financial information of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors, such one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in paragraph (a) and (b) of the section titled 'Other Matters' in this audit report.",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.

A Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nOur aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements/financial information insofar as it relates to six subsidiary companies, five associate companies and one joint venture company, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.

In determining the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\n- (i) The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is the functional currency of the Holding Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Holding Company operates.\n- (ii) Figures less than ' 50,000 have been shown at actual, wherever statutorily required to be disclosed, all other figures have been rounded off in decimals to the nearest ' in lakhs, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Classification of Assets and Liabilities into Current/ Non-Current\n\nThe Group has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of Current / NonCurrent classification of its Assets and Liabilities.\n\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, an asset is classified as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be realised, or is intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle; or\n- (ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n- (iii) It is expected to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or",

Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not affect this classification.\n\nAll other liabilities are classified as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current only.\n\n## (b) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf significant parts of an item of PPE have different useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classified as PPE when they meet the definition of PPE as specified in Ind AS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment.\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nPPE except freehold land are stated at their cost of acquisition/installation or construction net of accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n\n## (c) Expenditure during construction period:\n\nExpenditure/ Income during construction period (including financing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other non-current Assets'.\n\n## (d) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with indefinite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Group, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Group.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Group uses different useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic benefits from those classes of assets. The estimated useful life are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.",

Depreciation on deductions/disposals is provided on a pro-rata basis up to the month preceding the month of deduction/disposal.\n\n## (e) Intangible Assets and Amortisation:\n\n## \u00b7 Internally generated Intangible Assets:\n\nExpenditure pertaining to research is expensed out as and when incurred. Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised if such expenditure leads to creation of an asset, otherwise such expenditure is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## \u00b7 Intangible Assets acquired separately:\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax / duty credits\n\navailed wherever applicable) and any directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use. The Group determines the amortisation period as the period over which the future economic benefits will flow to the Group after taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed periodically, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. Class of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives / basis of amortisation are as under:\n\n|    | No Nature       | Estimated Useful life /  Basis of amortization                                                                                                    |\n|----|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|  1 | Jetty Rights    | Over the period of the  relevant agreement such  that the cumulative  amortisation is not less  than the cumulative rebate  availed by the Group. |\n|  2 | Mining  Rights  | Over the period of  the respective mining  agreement                                                                                              |\n|  3 | Mining  Reserve | On the basis of mineral  material extraction  (proportion of mineral  material extracted per  annum to total estimated                            |\n|  4 | Surface  Rights | Over the period of  the respective mining  agreement                                                                                              |\n|  5 | Software        | 3 Years                                                                                                                                           |\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (f) Assets/ Disposal Group classified as held for sale:\n\nThe Group classifies assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale",

Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets/ Disposal Group held for sale' and 'Liabilities/ Disposal Group held for sale' respectively. Once classified as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (g) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of non-financial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n\nValued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the finished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\n## \u00b7 Work-in- progress (WIP), finished goods, stockin-trade and trial run inventories:\n\nValued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods and WIP includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of Stock-in Trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n\n## \u00b7 Waste / Scrap:\n\nWaste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## (i) Employee Share based payments:\n\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.",

The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equitysettled employee benefits reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (j) Treasury Shares:\n\nThe Holding Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing its shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Holding Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing Costs:\n\nGeneral and specific borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost\n\nincurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange difference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (l) Government Grants:\n\nGovernment grants, related to assets, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with VAT / GST payment, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nThe benefit of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the difference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (m)  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as a finance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\nA present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of",

Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.\n\nClaims against the Group where the possibility of any outflow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in financial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in financial statements, where an inflow of economic benefits is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision :\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The cost is reviewed periodically and are adjusted to reflect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance, and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a finance cost in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (o) Revenue Recognition:\n\n## (i) Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an\n\namount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration and outgoing taxes on sale. Any amounts receivable from the customer are recognised as revenue after the control over the goods sold are transferred to the customer which is generally on dispatch/delivery of goods.\n- \u00b7 Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Significant financing component Generally, the Company receives shortterm advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n- -Dividend income is accounted for when the right to receive the income is established.\n- -Interest income is recognised using the Effective Interest Method.\n\n## (p) Lease:\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identified asset;\n- (ii) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n## As a lessee:\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through profit or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU or is recorded in Statement of Profit or Loss if the carrying amount of the right-ofuse asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n'Lease Liabilities' and 'Right of Use Assets' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classified as financing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash flows are classified as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor:\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (q) Employee benefits:\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans:\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a qualified independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is reflected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur.

The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The Group provides benefits such as gratuity, pension and provident fund to its employees which are treated as defined benefit plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a defined benefit plan, payable to the employees is based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Group and is in accordance with the Rules of the Group for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);\n- \u00b7 net interest expense or income; and\n- \u00b7 re-measurement\n\nThe present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual deficit or surplus in the Group's defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Provident Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Group are entitled to receive benefits in respect of provident fund, which is a defined benefit plan, for which both the employees and the Group make monthly contributions at a specified percentage of the covered employees' salary. The contributions as specified under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Group. The Group is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.\n\n## Defined contribution plans:\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such benefits. The Group provides benefits such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Group managed fund) to its employees which are treated as defined contribution plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Group are eligible for participation in defined contribution plans such as superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Group, since the Group has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution.\n\n## Other employee benefits:\n\nA liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee benefits are measured using the Projected Unit Credit method by a qualified independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period, at the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) Credits are in the form of unused tax credits that are carried forward by the Group for a specified period of time, hence it is grouped with Deferred Tax Asset. MAT is recognised as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Group will pay normal income tax during the specified period.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- b) In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nThe Government of India, on September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, inserted a new Section 115BAA in the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides an option to the Holding Company for paying Income Tax at reduced rates as per the provisions/conditions defined in the said section. The Holding Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Holding Company. However, the Holding Company has estimated and applied the lower income tax rate on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realized or settled in the future period when the Holding Company may be subjected to lower tax rate.\n\n## (s) Earnings Per Share:\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is computed by dividing the net profit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of equity shares which",

At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.\n\nExchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;\n- \u00b7 exchange differences relating to qualifying effective cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations which are recognised in OCI.\n\n## (u) Foreign operations:\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into INR, the functional currency of the Holding Company, at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange differences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in equity (as exchange differences on translating the financial statements of a foreign operation), except to the extent that the exchange differences are allocated to NCI.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange differences related to that foreign operation recognized in OCI is reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. If the Group disposes of part of its interest in a subsidiary but retains control, then the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is re-allocated to NCI. When the Group disposes of only a part of its interest in an associate or a joint venture while retaining significant influence or joint control, the relevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (v) Financial Instruments:\n\nA financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\n## Initial Recognition:\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and ancillary costs related to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss over the tenure of the financial assets or financial liabilities. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price (net of variable consideration).\n\n## Classification and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets\n\nThe Group classifies financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI') or Fair Value through Profit or Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:\n\n- \u00b7 the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and",

For financial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Group recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired financial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the financial asset has not increased significantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on financial asset increases significantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables do not contain significant financing component and as per simplified approach, loss allowances on trade receivables",

If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and recognises an associated liability for amounts it has to pay.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Group de-recognises financial liabilities when and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## Financial Guarantee Contract Liabilities\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities are disclosed in financial statements in accordance with Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\n## (w) Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n\n## (x) Financial liabilities and equity instruments:\n\n## \u00b7 Classification as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\n## (y) Derivative financial instruments:\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cashflow hedge or used in a net investment hedge.\n\n## (z) Hedge accounting:\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk as cash flow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in OCI and",

The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to effective portion as described above are reclassified to Statement of Profit or Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Group also hedges its risk of change in foreign exchange rates associated with net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries with a different functional currency than the Group's functional currency. Net investment hedges are accounted for similar to cash flow hedges and accordingly, any foreign exchange differences on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation reserve ('FCTR') so as to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The amounts accumulated in equity are included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the foreign operation is disposed or partially disposed.\n\n## (aa)  Segment Reporting: Identification of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker\n\n('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete financial information is available. Based on the management approach as defined in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (bb)  Goodwill:\n\nGoodwill arising out of Consolidation of financial statements of subsidiaries are tested for impairment at each reporting date.\n\n## (cc)  Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash flows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net profit before tax is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Group are segregated.\n\n## (dd)  Business Combination and Goodwill:\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.",

A cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when, there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Group determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identified all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identified, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Group recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classified either as equity or financial liability. Amount classified as financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n\n## (ee)  Discontinued Operations:\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business, the operations and cashflows of which can be clearly distinguished from those of the rest of the Group and which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and\n\n- -Is a part of single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or\n- -Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.\n\nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.\n\nWhen an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative Statement of Profit and Loss is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.\n\n## Note 1(C) Key sources of estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe preparation of the Groups financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Group uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (iii) Income Taxes:\n\nThe Group calculates income tax expense based on reported income and estimated exemptions / deduction likely available to the Group. The Holding Company is continuing with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and different exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Company. However, the Group has applied the lower income tax rates on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to realised or settled in the future when the Group may be subject to lower tax rate based on the future financials projections.\n\n## (iv) Fair value measurement of financial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (v) Defined benefit plans:\n\nThe cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical\n\nbenefits and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its longterm nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## (vi) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n## (vii)  Share-based payments:\n\nThe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions and cash settled transactions with employees using either Black-Scholes model or binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 50.\n\n## (viii) Litigation and contingencies:\n\nThe Group has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management's assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements.",

The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Group, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## Brand:\n\nThe Group has used relief from royalty method for value analysis of Brand. The method estimates the value as the present value of the after-tax projected revenues cash flows attributable to the Brand value.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash flows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk associated with the Brand Name, which is higher than the overall business.\n\n## (b) Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on size of land parcel.\n\n## Leasehold land:\n\nLeasehold land was valued basis the leasehold interest for the remaining duration of the lease.\n\n## Other Assets:\n\nThe cost approach has been adopted for fair valuing all the fixed assets except vehicles which have been measured at the old book values less depreciation.\n\nThe cost approach includes calculation of depreciated replacement cost using price trends applied to historical cost and capitalisation of\n\nall the indirect cost, these trends are on the basis of price indices obtained from recognized sources such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)/ Office of Economic Adviser (OEA) or market intelligence. In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## (x) Disposal Groups:\n\nThe Group has used comparable market multiple approach to assess the fair value of the disposal group.\n\nUnder the market multiple approach, enterprise value of a company is determined by using multiples derived from valuations of comparable companies, as manifested through stock market valuations of listed companies considering Enterprise Value/ Revenue and Enterprise value/ EBITDA multiples based on their market price and latest published financial information.\n\nAppropriate adjustments are made (e.g. for debt and surplus assets) to arrive at the equity value of the disposal group.\n\n## (xi) Classification of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Group's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Description of the nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows:\n\n- a) Capital Reserve: Company's capital reserve is mainly on account of acquisition of cement business of Larsen & Toubro Ltd., Gujarat Units of Jaypee Cement Corporation Ltd (JCCL) and cement capacities of 21.2 MTPA of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) and JCCL, being excess of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid.\n- b) Securities Premium: Securities premium is credited when shares are issued at premium. It is utilised in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to issue bonus shares, to provide for premium on redemption of shares or debentures, equity related expenses like underwriting costs, etc.\n- c) Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR): The Company has issued redeemable non-convertible debentures. Accordingly, the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 (as amended), requires the company to create DRR out of profits of the company available for payment of dividend. DRR is required to be created for an amount which is equal to 25% of the value of debentures issued. However, this requirement is no more applicable w.e.f. April 1, 2018 as per the amendment in the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 vide dated August 16, 2019; accordingly the Company has not made any new addition in the said reserve and accounted the reversal of outstanding reserve linked to payment of specific non-convertible debentures.\n- d) General reserve: The Company has transferred a portion of the net profit of the Company before declaring dividend to general reserve pursuant to the earlier provision of Companies Act, 1956. Mandatory transfer to general reserve is not required under the Act.\n- e) Shares Options Outstanding Reserve: The Company has three share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Company's shares have been granted to certain executives and senior employees. The sharebased payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.\n- f) Treasury Shares : The Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employees Stock Options Scheme, 2018 (ESOS 2018). As per Ind AS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation, Reacquired equity shares of the Company are called Treasury Shares and deducted from equity.\n- g) Cashflow Hedge Reserve: The Company has designated its hedging instruments as cash flow hedges and any effective portion of cashflow hedge is maintained in the said reserve. In case the hedging becomes ineffective, the amount is recognised to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n- h) Exchange differences on translating the financial statements of foreign operations: Exchange variation in Opening Equity Share Capital, Reserves and Surplus, Assets and Liabilities of UltraTech Cement Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd, UltraTech Cement Middle East Investments Ltd, PT UltraTech Mining Indonesia and PT UltraTech Investment Indonesia is accounted under this reserve.\n\n## Note 17: Non-Current Borrowings\n\n| Particulars                                  | Non-Current          | Non-Current          | '  in Crores Current Maturities of Long-Term debts *   | '  in Crores Current Maturities of Long-Term debts *   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                              | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 | As at March 31, 2023                                   | As at March 31, 2022                                   |\n| Secured:                                     |                      |                      |                                                        |                                                        |\n| Non-Convertible Debentures - Note (a1)       | 500.00               | 500.00               | -                                                      | -                                                      |\n| Sales Tax/VAT/GST Deferment Loan - Note (c1) | 168.10               | 159.04               | 34.61                                                  | 34.60                                                  |\n|                                              | 668.10               | 659.04               | 34.61                                                  | 34.60                                                  |\n| Unsecured:                                   |                      |                      |                                                        |                                                        |\n| Non-Convertible Debentures - Note (a2)       | 500.00               | 1,500.00             | 1,000.00                                               | 250.00                                                 |\n| Foreign Currency Bonds- Note (d)             | 3,286.80             | 3,031.70             | -                                                      | -                                                      |\n| Term Loans from Banks:                       |                      |                      |                                                        |                                                        |\n| In Foreign Currency - Note (b)               | 821.74               | -                    | -                                                      | 303.17                                                 |\n| Sales Tax/VAT/GST Deferment Loan - Note (c2) | 79.77                | 112.26               | 32.51                                                  | 40.65                                                  |\n|                                              | 4,688.31             | 4,643.96             | 1,032.51                                               | 593.82                                                 |\n| Total                                        | 5,356.41             | 5,303.00             | 1,067.12                                               | 628.42                                                 |\n\n- * Amount disclosed under the head ' Current Borrowings' (Refer Note 22).",

Principles of Consolidation:\n\nThese financial statements are prepared on the following basis in accordance with Ind AS on 'Consolidated Financial Statements' (Ind AS - 110), 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures' (Ind AS - 28) and 'Disclosure of interests in other entities' (Ind AS - 112), specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013.\n\n## (i) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.",

Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## (iii) Loss of control\n\nWhen the Company loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## (iv) Equity accounted investees\n\nThe Group's interests in equity accounted investees comprise interest in associates and joint venture.\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the Group's share of profit or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\n## (v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nThe financial statements of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Venture and Associates used in the consolidation procedure are drawn upto the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2023.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group and its subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of financial instruments are:\n\n- Level 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n- Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.\n\n|                                                       | '  in Crores         | '  in Crores         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Particulars                                           | As at March 31, 2023 | As at March 31, 2022 |\n| Financial Assets at fair value through profit or loss |                      |                      |\n| Investments - Level 2                                 | 6,259.56             | 5,899.52             |\n| Investments - Level 3                                 | 141.38               | 71.08                |\n| Fair value Hedge Instruments                          |                      |                      |\n| Derivative Assets - Level 2                           | 474.61               | 406.15               |\n| Total                                                 | 6,875.55             | 6,376.75             |\n| Fair value Hedge Instruments                          |                      |                      |\n| Derivative Liability - Level 2                        | 103.76               | 10.51                |\n| Total                                                 | 103.76               | 10.51                |\n\nThe management assessed that the carrying amounts of cash and bank balances, trade receivables, loans, trade payables, cash credits, commercial papers and other financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair values largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n- (a) The fair values of the quoted investments/units of mutual fund schemes are based on market price/net asset value at the reporting date.\n- (b) The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves and an appropriate discount factor.\n- (c) The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value determined using forward exchange rates and interest rate curve of the respective currencies.\n- (d) The fair value of currency swap is calculated as the present value determined using forward exchange rates, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and an appropriate discount factor.\n- (e) The fair value of foreign currency option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.\n- (f) The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group's operations. The Group's principal financial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the group. The group uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity fixed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The several sources of risks which the Group is exposed to and their management are given below:\n\n| Risk   |                               | Exposure Arising From                                                                       | Measurement                                      | Management                                                                                                  |\n|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| I)     | Market Risk                   | Market Risk                                                                                 | Market Risk                                      | Market Risk                                                                                                 |\n|        | A)    Foreign  Currency  Risk | Committed commercial  transaction Financial asset and Liabilities                           | Cash Flow Forecasting Sensitivity Analysis       | (a)   Forward foreign exchange contracts (b)   Foreign currency options (c)   Principal only/Currency swaps |\n|        | B)   Interest Rate  Risk      | Long Term Borrowings at  variable rates Investments in Debt Schemes                         | Sensitivity Analysis,  Interest rate movements   | (a)   Interest Rate swaps, Coupon Only swaps (b)   Portfolio Diversification                                |\n|        | C)    Commodity  Risk         | Movement in prices of  commodities mainly Imported  Thermal Coal and Pet Coke               | Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price  tracking | (a)   Commodity Fixed Prices (b)   Swaps/Options                                                            |\n| II)    | Credit Risk                   | Trade receivables, Investments,  Derivative financial instruments,  Loans and Bank balances | Ageing analysis, Credit  Rating                  | (a)   Diversification of mutual fund  investments, (b)   Credit limit & credit worthiness                   |\n| III)   | Liquidity Risks               | Borrowings and Other Liabilities  and Liquid Investments                                    | Rolling cash flow  forecasts Broker Quotes       | (a)   Adequate unused credit lines and  borrowing facilities (b)   Portfolio Diversification                |\n\nThe Group has standard operating procedures and investment policy for deployment of surplus liquidity, which allows investment in debt securities, fixed deposits and mutual fund schemes of debt categories only and restricts the exposure in equity markets.",

It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Group on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## (I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n## A) Foreign Currency Risk:\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash flows of an exposure in foreign currency, which fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials & spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2023   | March 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Trade Receivables                                     |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 0.41             | 1.29             |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 37.91            | 23.03            |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.40             | 0.62             |\n| Others                                                | 0.15             | 0.46             |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 50.00            | 40.00            |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 34.92            | 25.14            |\n| LKR                                                   | 0.65             | 0.65             |\n\n## Foreign currency sensitivity on unhedged exposure:\n\n100 bps increase in foreign exchange rates will have the following impact on profit before tax.\n\n| Particulars   | As at   March 31, 2023   |   As at   March 31, 2022 |\n|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| USD           | (4.17)                   |                     0.17 |\n| LKR           | 0.03                     |                     0.02 |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps profit will decrease by an equal amount.",

The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's short term borrowing (excluding commercial paper) with floating interest rates. For all long-term borrowings with floating rates, the risk of variation in the interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. The Group constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its financing strategies to achieve an optimal maturity profile and financing cost.\n\n## Interest rate exposure\n\n| Particulars                | Total borrowings   | Floating rate  borrowings   | Fixed rate  borrowings   | '  in Crores Non-Interest  bearing borrowings   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| INR - Borrowings           | 5,463.54           | 240.00                      | 4,908.55                 | 314.99                                          |\n| USD - Borrowings           | 4,437.24           | 1,150.44                    | 3,286.80                 | -                                               |\n| Total as at March 31, 2023 | 9,900.78           | 1,390.44                    | 8,195.35                 | 314.99                                          |\n| INR - Borrowings           | 6,867.55           | 391.98                      | 6,129.02                 | 346.55                                          |\n| USD - Borrowings           | 3,335.29           | 303.59                      | 3,031.70                 | -                                               |\n| Total as at March 31, 2022 | 10,202.84          | 695.57                      | 9,160.72                 | 346.55                                          |\n\nNote: Interest rate risk hedged for foreign currency borrowings has been shown under Fixed Rate borrowings.\n\nInterest rate sensitivities for unhedged exposure (impact on profit before tax due to increase in 100 bps):\n\n| Particulars   | As at   March 31, 2023   | '  in Crores As at   March 31, 2022   |\n|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| INR           | (2.40)                   | (3.92)                                |\n| USD           | (11.50)                  | (3.04)                                |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps profit will increase by an equal amount.\n\nInterest rate sensitivity has been calculated assuming the borrowings outstanding at reporting date have been outstanding for the entire reporting period.\n\n## Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management:\n\nForward Exchange and Interest Rates Swaps Contracts:\n\n- (A) Derivatives for hedging currency and interest rates, outstanding are as under:\n\n| Particulars   | Particulars                                 | Hedged item     | Currency   | As at   March 31, 2023   | As at   March 31, 2022   | in Crores Cross  Currency   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| a.            | Forward Contracts                           | Imports         | USD        | 37.73                    | 35.10                    | Rupees                      |\n|               |                                             | Loan receivable | USD        | -                        | 0.48                     | Rupees                      |\n|               |                                             | Imports         | Euro       | 4.35                     | 2.03                     | USD                         |\n|               |                                             | Imports         | JPY        | 5.63                     | -                        | USD                         |\n|               |                                             | Investment      | USD        | 28.80                    | 18.00                    | Rupees                      |\n|               |                                             | Investment      | AED        | 105.61                   | 66.13                    | USD                         |\n| b.            | Options                                     | Imports         | USD        | 16.50                    | -                        | Rupees                      |\n| c.            | Other Derivatives:                          |                 |            |                          |                          |                             |\n|               | i.

This derivative is being used to hedge the Group's exposure to AED foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to OCI to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries. There is no ineffectiveness during the year ended March 31, 2023.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the forward contracts.\n\n| Particulars                                                        | March 31, 2023            | March 31, 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Currency exchange risk hedged                                      | AED to INR                | AED to INR       |\n| Nominal amount of hedging instruments                              | AED 1,056.09 Mn           | AED 661.13 Mn    |\n| Maturity date                                                      | March 2024 to  March 2033 | March 2023       |\n| Carrying value of hedging instruments (Derivative Assets)          | '  2.21 Cr                | '  9.19 Cr       |\n| Change in the fair value of the hedging instrument during the year | '  2.21 Cr                | '  9.19 Cr       |\n| Fair value gain on effective hedge                                 | '  2.21 Cr                | '  9.19 Cr       |\n\nThe hedging gain recognised in OCI before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for measuring effectiveness. There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss.\n\n## (D) Commodity price risk management:\n\nCommodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to fluctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to various external factors, which can affect the production cost of the Company. Since the Energy costs is one of the primary costs drivers, any fluctuation in fuel prices can lead to drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Company enters into forward covers for imported coal, enter into long-term supply agreement for pet coke, identifying new sources of supply etc. While forward covers are prevailing in the markets for coal but in case of pet coke no such derivative is available; it has to be procured at spot prices. Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and fuel requirement are monitored by the central procurement team.",

Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements.\n- Ind AS 12 Income Taxes: The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.",

The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are 'monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'. Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty.\n\n## Signatures to Note '1' to '63'\n\nAs per our report of even date attached.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board of Directors\n\nFor B S R & Co.
