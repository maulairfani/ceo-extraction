We began by talking to our employees, to explore and fully understand what CRH is at its very best.\n\nWe continued by looking out into the world to better understand the needs in the world that CRH can fulfil. With insight from experts from a wide range of fields, we developed a broad view of the impact that CRH has, beyond what we make and sell - how we contribute to a better built world.\n\nAt CRH what we make is essential to life and living, because our materials, products and solutions define how our world is built. We help make homes, buildings and infrastructure that stand the test of time.\n\nWe have a relentless drive and a capability that can be applied to solving some of the major challenges of our time.\n\nVISION GRAPHIC\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe've always had a culture of reinvention and continuous improvement.

The last 12 months have represented another challenging year for the world and for the building materials sector. The Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer reviews on page 14 and 62 respectively outline the key operational highlights and drivers of CRH's performance in what has been another record year for the Group despite these challenges.\n\n## Purpose\n\nDuring 2022, we launched our Purpose. We also took the opportunity to review and revise the wording of our values to strengthen and align with our Purpose. The Purpose statement and the revised values are set out on page 6.\n\nThe process to articulate our Purpose included input from our employees through focus groups and test panels across all geographies, divisions and organisational levels. We also took on board valuable insights from global experts in a range of fields. I was present at the launch of our Purpose last year and was struck by the extent to which the newly articulated Purpose resonated with those present, by encapsulating what has driven the success of CRH to date and underpinning how we will build the CRH of the future.\n\nThe feedback we received on our Purpose during our engagement with employees during the year, details of which are included in the Corporate Governance Report on page 88, was similarly positive. Our Purpose is currently being shared with our whole organisation and is being embedded in our operational and strategic processes, demonstrating our commitment to guiding and nurturing the culture of the organisation.",

See cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements on page 135.\n- 2. Refer to page 27 for further detail on our decarbonisation targets.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAt CRH our vision is to develop sustainable solutions that build, connect and improve our world. In recent years we have reshaped and repositioned our business to help realise that vision and to deliver superior growth and performance. We have a clear strategy in place which has sharpened our competitive advantage, strengthened our resilience and enabled CRH to deliver a strong performance during 2022, despite an increasingly challenging and volatile cost environment globally.\n\n## Solutions Strategy\n\nIntegrating our materials and products with value-added services that can be delivered as solutions in multiple markets uniquely positions CRH to capture additional value across the entire construction value chain. By deepening our relationships with customers, removing reasons to switch and improving our pricing power we can capture more business from each individual customer, deliver greater production and logistical efficiencies and achieve higher utilisation rates on our asset base.\n\nIn 2022 we continued to develop our solutions proposition with a strong focus on enhancing the ability of our businesses to solve problems and address new and emerging challenges that customers are facing. This included the acquisition of businesses that complement and enhance our existing offerings and enable us to deliver more complete solutions for customers.\n\nCRH spent a total of $3.3 billion on acquisitions and investments in 2022 (2021: $1.5 billion). The most significant of which was our $1.9 billion acquisition of Barrette Outdoor Living (Barrette), North America's leading provider of fencing and railing systems for the outdoor living space. Integrating Barrette with our existing outdoor living businesses enables us to provide a complete suite of sustainable outdoor living solutions for our customers.\n\nWe are also seeing increasing demand for integrated solutions in major infrastructure and commercial projects in key markets across each of our Divisions. In 2022 this included areas such as drainage and wastewater systems, energy and telecoms  infrastructure, manufacturing facilities and data centres. CRH is uniquely positioned to meet this demand through our extensive operational footprint and ability to combine multiple materials, products and services at a level of scale required to deliver these projects on-time and on-budget.\n\nThis helped CRH to deliver a strong financial performance during 2022 which saw sales 12% and EBITDA (as defined)* 13% ahead of the prior year, while EBITDA (as defined)* margin increased despite the significant inflationary cost environment.\n\n## Sustainability Leadership\n\nWe continued to make progress in decarbonising our business and, in 2022 announced an industry-leading absolute carbon emissions reduction target. In early 2023, the SBTi validated our revised targets 2 in line with the updated 1.5\u00b0C science-based framework which now",

This is aligned with our ambition to be a net-zero business by 2050.\n\nWe are innovating to improve circularity and climate resilience in the built environment. This includes the development of new low-impact products and solutions that are less carbon intensive and help to mitigate and adapt to climate change while reducing its environmental and social effects.\n\nThis is an area where we see increasing opportunities as public policy changes begin to drive an increase in demand for products such as lowcarbon concretes and asphalt. In 2022 assisted by our Innovation Centre for Sustainable Construction (ICSC), our businesses continued to introduce new low-carbon concretes.\n\n## Customer Connected\n\nThere are currently over 100 projects being undertaken by the ICSC as part of our innovation agenda. In 2022 we further increased our investment in innovation, launching a new venture capital unit, CRH Ventures, and establishing a $250 million venturing and innovation fund. CRH Ventures will partner with construction technology and climate technology companies, across the construction value chain, investing in the development of new technologies and innovative solutions to meet the increasingly complex needs of customers and evolving trends in construction.\n\nCRH is particularly well positioned with the technical capabilities, knowledge and expertise of a global industry leader, to pilot and scale new technologies and innovations that will enable safer, smarter and more sustainable construction. We also have the benefit of deep market insights and strong customer relationships which provide CRH with a unique understanding of the evolving needs of the industry and the changing nature of construction.\n\nMaintaining our ability to solve our customers' complex construction challenges is critical to our continued commercial and operational success and we are investing to strengthen our market leadership.\n\n## Empowered Talent\n\nAt CRH people are our priority. We pride ourselves on the enduring relationships that we build and the care we take for each other's safety and wellbeing.\n\nWe took early and decisive action to protect our colleagues in Ukraine and their families in February 2022 and I remain deeply moved by the efforts of our people. We also stood together as a company to support the humanitarian effort in Ukraine including raising and donating over $1.7 million to UNICEF.\n\nWe continue to put safety first and to drive our culture of safety and wellness towards ensuring zero harm. Regrettably, despite our best efforts, we fell short in delivering on our safety target in 2022 with five fatalities recorded during the year. This is unacceptable and has further strengthened our resolve to achieve our ambition of zero harm and target of zero fatalities. Our thoughts are with the families of the deceased.\n\nIn 2022 we continued to deliver our Inclusion & Diversity (I&D) strategy by appointing a new executive committee sponsor for I&D strategy setting and a new Chief Culture and People Officer (CCPO) at executive committee level, to elevate the strategic focus on culture and people at CRH.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nOur people are essential to unlocking the full potential of CRH's solutionsfocused business model. Through our global talent strategy and development programmes we are investing in our people to grow their skills and drive our business forward. This helps us to identify and attract talent and empower the next generation of leaders to reinvent the way our world is built.\n\n## Focused Growth\n\nOur integrated solutions strategy is the engine which will drive future growth in CRH and will allow our business to reach its full potential, fuelling our innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, while delivering significantly higher margins, returns and industry-leading cash generation.\n\nTo deliver this strategy and fully capitalise on the opportunities in the market requires an enhanced organisational structure capable of better serving our customers through increased cross-company collaboration and innovation. This will also help to unlock additional improvements in productivity, growth and financial performance. For this reason, effective 1 January 2023 we have reorganised CRH into two distinct Divisions, CRH Americas and CRH Europe.\n\nCRH Americas will bring together our existing Americas Materials businesses with our Architectural Products and Infrastructure Products businesses in North America. CRH Europe will bring together our existing Europe Materials businesses with our Architectural Products and Infrastructure Products businesses in Europe, as well as our global Leviat business.\n\nBringing these businesses together in the Americas and Europe will establish two strong growth platforms that position CRH to lead the way in integrated, sustainable construction solutions that are scalable and replicable across multiple markets. This is another important step in achieving our vision to build, connect and improve our world.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOverall, we expect resilient demand and increased pricing in 2023 despite macroeconomic uncertainties and ongoing cost inflation. Our operations in North America will benefit from strong pricing and robust infrastructure demand being underpinned by significant increases in funding at both federal and state level. The non-residential sector is supported by government funding initiatives in clean energy and the onshoring of critical manufacturing, while the residential new-build sector will experience short-term weakness as a result of rising interest rates. In Europe we expect positive pricing momentum to offset lower volumes. Construction activity in Central and Eastern Europe will continue to be supported by EU infrastructure funds, while our businesses in Western Europe remain underpinned by resilient repair, maintenance and improvement (RMI) activity and stable infrastructure demand. Notwithstanding a number of macroeconomic risks and uncertainties, CRH remains well positioned for another year of progress in 2023 due to our uniquely integrated, valueadded solutions strategy together with a strong and flexible balance sheet.\n\nAlbert Manifold Chief Executive 1 March 2023",

This business is underpinned by a portfolio of well-located assets in attractive construction markets in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our business addresses the needs of customers with both new build and RMI requirements in infrastructure, residential, non-residential and construction markets. Demand for our materials, products and services is driven by a number of important market fundamentals, while sector specific trends are creating challenges and opportunities that will shape the way in which we meet that demand now and in the future.\n\nThrough its broad base of high-quality businesses and leadership positions in local construction markets, CRH is well positioned to capitalise on future growth potential, both organic and inorganic. Our business is also positioned to align with the major demand fundamentals in key global markets which enables CRH to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the changing nature of construction. This has involved moving our business away from being solely a supplier of base materials and has helped CRH deliver superior performance.\n\n## Demand Fundamentals\n\nConstruction demand continues to be driven by a number of factors including significant infrastructure needs, long-term residential under-build and a resurgence in non-residential demand.\n\nIn the US we have orientated our operating footprint to benefit from resilient RMI activity in the North East and Midwest along with new-build expansion driven by migration and population growth in the South and West.\n\nIn Europe we have seen resilient RMI demand and advancements in sustainable construction in the more stable and developed markets of Western Europe. This is in addition to significant new-build infrastructure and residential needs coupled with a supportive regulatory environment for sustainable solutions in the higher growth markets in the East.\n\nIn both geographies we have seen significant government support for infrastructure, through state and federal funding in the US and EU funding in Eastern Europe.\n\n<!-- image -->",

CRH is uniquely positioned to deliver solutions which meet these and other demands.\n\nOur ability to combine materials, products and services provides CRH with a competitive advantage and an opportunity to strengthen and scale our position in key construction markets. We can sustain that competitive advantage by building on our core strengths with renewed focus on the customer, sustainability, and innovation.\n\n## Solutions for a Sustainable Future\n\nOur integrated approach is allowing us to take great strides in providing the solutions needed by our customers and communities.\n\n- 1. Decarbonisation: Including designing-out embodied and operational carbon, reuse of carbon we cannot avoid, providing support infrastructure for energy transition and developing energy efficiency solutions.\n- 2. Waste: This includes the recycling and reuse of construction and other waste, enabling resilient, resource-efficient buildings and infrastructure, building more circular supply chains.\n- 3. Water: Conserving water across the value chain and advancing solutions that enhance resilience to flooding, upgrading water infrastructure and ground water recharging.\n\nWhile these themes are highly complex, we recognise that they are of growing importance for society and for communities around the world. This is why, at CRH, we are actively addressing them and embracing the value creation opportunities they present.\n\nFor further information on how we are addressing these themes please see pages 26 to 35.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022 CRH's operating companies across the US helped to deliver multiple infrastructure projects receiving funding under the Act. State level funding for infrastructure projects is also an important driver of CRH's business in the US where CRH is the largest road paver and undertakes significant road construction and repair and maintenance work on behalf of local and state governments.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\n## How regulatory certification is helping to develop the market for sustainable cements in France\n\nOur Europe Materials business Eqiom, received NF certification (which indicates compliance with French, European and International standards) for its new reduced CO 2 cement range in 2022 following the launch of a new standard designation by France's Scientific and Technical Center for Building (CSTB). The new certification will allow the cement's use in structural concrete for the first time. This change represents a significant opportunity for Eqiom as it expands the market opportunity for low CO 2 cement solutions.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n## Industry specific trends\n\n## Challenges and opportunities\n\nIn addition to important macro trends, there are a number of construction industry specific trends that are shaping how CRH evolves to meet the needs of its customers and which are having an impact at all levels of the value chain.\n\n## 1. Climate Change\n\nThe changing climate will require a more resilient built environment. This will drive demand for the rebuilding of critical infrastructure and the retrofitting of homes and other buildings. In addition the need for regulatory changes aimed at decarbonising our industry will stimulate demand for circularity and sustainable materials and products.\n\n## 2. Changing customer preferences\n\nCustomers' needs are evolving and there is increasing demand for more holistic solutions and services. In addition increasing reporting requirements on product attributes and increased digitalisation in distribution and retail is driving go-to-market innovation.\n\n## 3. Supply side shifts\n\nA range of factors including labour shortages, automation, migration, retraining, and wage inflation is driving supply side change that is shaping our industry, while increasing investment in technology and digital solutions is creating significant value.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The global population is currently 8 billion and is expected to increase by 2 billion people in the next 30 years, with much of this growth predicted in urban areas. With cities already at capacity, there are significant demands on the built environment and the infrastructure needed to support these expanding populations. To meet these demands, society must move quickly to plan for growth and provide the efficient and resilient buildings, infrastructure and utilities, such as clean water, affordable energy, transport and telecommunications, that are essential for modern life.\n\nIn addition to developing this essential infrastructure, we must also address the increasing demands being put on our world's resources. To ensure that we protect vital global resources, both public and private sector leaders need to take bold action to support and invest in sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure.\n\nAs the provider of the materials, products and services that are constructing the world of tomorrow, we see significant opportunities for our business to lead the way in construction solutions to help tackle the sustainability challenges faced by the built environment and position CRH for future growth and improved performance.\n\nWe are embracing our responsibility to society and evolving as a business to successfully address the macro trends that are redefining our industry. Our new sustainability framework identifies three rapidly emerging and hard to address global challenges for the built environment and society decarbonisation, waste and water.

The built environment, including the homes, buildings and infrastructure on which we rely, accounts for approximately 40% of global carbon emissions. The major contributor is the energy that is used to heat, cool and operate buildings year-round, followed by emissions from the manufacturing of the materials used in construction. There is a significant opportunity to design, construct and renovate the urban landscape to provide the efficient, resilient, net-zero buildings, infrastructure and utilities our communities need to minimise the impacts of and adapt to the risks posed by climate change.\n\n## Reinventing the Way we Build\n\nExtreme weather events and their impact on populations, infrastructure and economic output of affected regions are increasing in frequency and magnitude. In addition, the built environment requires a significant transition to address the challenges of increased urbanisation whilst providing affordable, resilient and energy efficient homes and infrastructure. At CRH, we believe we have a responsibility to reduce carbon emissions from our business, manage our own exposure to the impacts of climate change and also provide the sustainable integrated solutions our customers and society need.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy provides the opportunity to help solve the challenges of decarbonisation and create value through the delivery of high-performance buildings and infrastructure, including solutions to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and provision of clean energy infrastructure. To accomplish this, the construction sector must use materials efficiently at every point in supply chains, improve energy efficiency and tackle carbon emissions throughout the entire life-cycle of construction projects and the buildings and infrastructure they create.\n\nAt CRH, we continuously strive to build strong connections with our customers and suppliers across every business activity, recognising the role we play in responding to the demands of our customers and communities to develop the innovative solutions needed to transform the way we build. As a global leader in the supply of sustainable materials and solutions, all aspects of our business strive for low-carbon and low-impact production, products and services to mitigate and adapt to climate change and combat its environmental and societal effects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

With society moving away from fossil fuels, we are proud to be laying the foundations for the clean energy transition through our provision of sustainable integrated solutions for the infrastructure that is needed, for example, to support solar and wind energy installations and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nWhether harnessing power from inland or coastal waters, or switching to wind-derived renewable electricity generation, all forms of low and zerocarbon energy require one or more of the CRH product range. In addition, we recognise the contribution that many of our products make to ensuring better quality, sustainable buildings, helping customers achieve higher scores in green building rating schemes, such as BREEAM\u00ae, DGNB and LEED\u00ae. This includes thermal mass properties of concrete for improved building energy efficiency.\n\n## Committing to Climate Action\n\nAs an industry, we must take a whole-life approach to carbon and take responsibility for reducing our direct and indirect emissions as we help prepare society for a changing environment. At CRH, we are working to ensure that our businesses, products and the assets built from them are part of the solution to climate change. We are committed to further reducing carbon from our operations and supply chain and ensuring that the vital products we provide help us to deliver on our ambition to be net-zero by 2050. CRH has a long and proud history of setting ambitious carbon reduction targets and achieving them ahead of schedule. In 2021, we accelerated our target to decrease the carbon intensity of our cement production, bringing forward our cement specific net 3 CO 2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product target of 520kg from 2030 to 2025.\n\nRecognising the ongoing need for absolute emissions reductions across our activities, in 2022 we announced an industry-leading ambition to reduce our absolute carbon emissions by 25% by 2030 (from a 2020 base year). In early 2023, the SBTi validated our revised targets 4 in line with the updated 1.5\u00b0C science-based framework which now equate to a 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030 5 (from a 2021 base year). This target applies to our group-wide gross carbon emissions and covers our total footprint across Scope 1, 2 and 3. It is also inclusive of organic business growth.\n\nWe also joined the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative in 2021, which aims to achieve net-zero global emissions by no later than 2050 in order to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. See page 31 for more information on our progress against our carbon reduction targets.\n\n- 1.

CRH further commits to reduce gross Scope 3 GHG emissions 23.5% from purchased clinker and cement per tonne purchased over the same timeframe.  *The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.\n- 5. CRH is not relying on carbon offsetting to achieve its 2030 emission reduction target and is committed to decarbonising our operations and value chain. We are involved in a number of initiatives with a goal of removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere. In the longer-term, carbon offsets may become more relevant for residual emissions.",

Our decarbonisation roadmap is business-led and executed through locally managed plans. There is central oversight and co-ordination that builds on our significant experience in carbon reduction across different geographies, functions and business types, where for many years our\n\ndedicated team of experts have been active. For example, technical experts within our Group Technical Services team are key enablers in delivering our decarbonisation roadmap across our cement activities, which represent the largest share of Group Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Our 2025 cement specific net CO 2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product reduction target is a component of the 2030 roadmap and the actions and costs to achieve this target have been fully reflected in the roadmap. Accelerating decarbonisation efforts to meet our 2050 net-zero ambition will require collaboration across governments, industries and society to develop the technologies, supporting infrastructure and the right policy environment needed to achieve global carbon reductions. Some of these technologies are well known but require further scaling-up and deployment. Others require further research and development before they can be implemented across production processes.\n\n## Our Decarbonisation Roadmap Levers\n\n## KEY ACTIONS\n\n| Low-carbon products            | Designing and formulating low-carbon products                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Low-carbon fuels               | Maximising the use of lower-carbon fuels, including  waste biomass, as alternative sources of heat                                                   |\n| Recycled materials             | Increasing the use of recovered and recycled material  inputs for our processes, products and solutions                                              |\n| Clean electricity              | Switching to clean electrical energy, improving our  demand management and increasing our generation  capability                                     |\n| Transport and mobile equipment | Decarbonising our 'on-road' and 'off-road' vehicles  and mobile equipment                                                                            |\n| Responsible sourcing           | consume by acquiring, purchasing and sourcing  responsibly                                                                                           |\n| Business optimisation          | Implementing the best available techniques in  our manufacturing operations and optimising the  emissions footprint of the activities in our network |\n| Next generation technologies   | Focusing investment on new, low-carbon technologies,  and solutions across the group operations                                                      |",

We are also involved in the GCCA's innovation programme, 'Innovandi', which supports research and development on emerging technologies to help the industry decarbonise and produce net-zero concrete by 2050.\n\nOur decarbonisation roadmap levers, highlighted below, focus on the key technological and operational areas to drive net-zero aligned decarbonisation.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EXAMPLES OF PROGRESS DURING 2022\n\nWe continue to drive carbon emission reduction in our cement and concrete products through the replacement of high CO 2 clinker with traditional supplementary materials such as limestone, slag and fly ash. In addition, new materials such as natural pozzolans and calcined clay were introduced into our wider product mix, a result of our Group-led research over previous years.\n\nWe are an industry leader in the use of low-carbon and alternative fuels. Our in-house technical experts continue to develop knowledge and guide our businesses in using alternative and waste biomass fuels to reduce carbon emissions. For example, Jura Cement, part of our Europe Materials Division, is using 80% waste-derived alternative fuels. In addition, in 2022 numerous trials were undertaken with external partners in North America and Europe to replace fossil fuels, such as diesel, with Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) in our operations and on-site mobile equipment and develop new innovative solutions to reduce CO 2 emissions.\n\nWe are an industry-leading recycler of asphalt and the largest recycler of building materials in North America. Approximately 25% of every mile of road we build is from recycled materials. In addition, our MoistureShield decking product from Oldcastle APG, part of our Building Products Division, is made with 95% recycled content. In Finland, Rudus, part of our Europe Materials Division, offers recycled alternatives to virgin concretes and aggregates. Up to 30% of natural aggregates in our Uuma-concrete products can be replaced with recycled aggregates, hence substantially contributing to CO 2 reduction and saving of scarce natural resources.\n\nWe actively continue to target an increase of renewable energy across our operations. We are increasingly focused on procuring power from renewable sources, such as on-site solar installations at Leviat's production site in Melbourne, Australia, part of our Building Products Division, which will cut energy costs on-site by 35%. We are also supporting the global transition to clean electricity. For example, Staker Parson, part of our Americas Materials Division, collaborated to install a wind farm at its Gomex Pit location in Utah, reducing pressures on the national power infrastructure.\n\nDelivering an increasingly sustainable transport model across road, rail and water is a key part of our transition to a low-carbon economy. This includes the electrification of vehicles and mobile equipment. For example, Tarmac, part of our Europe Materials Division, has committed to transitioning its fleet of corporate cars and vans to electric vehicles by 2030. In 2022 Tarmac acquired the first electric battery concrete mixer truck in the United Kingdom (UK) at its Washwood Heath site in Birmingham, marking a significant milestone for both the business and wider UK construction industry as part of a continued drive towards net-zero.\n\nWe are increasing our efforts to reduce the CO 2 emissions throughout our entire value chain, with specific focus on emissions from purchased goods and materials, transportation, and fuels and energy. We actively participate in cross-industrial cooperation to drive decarbonisation across all levers. In 2022 CRH and Shell created a strategic alliance to explore decarbonisation opportunities across transport, operations, and materials. The solutions include, but are not limited to, vehicle electrification and charging infrastructure to reduce transport emissions; deploying low-carbon fuels for off-road equipment and renewable electricity to power facilities.\n\nWe continue to invest in and guide our plants in achieving best-in-class production efficiency and operational excellence and pride ourselves on continuously measuring and improving our operations. For example, within our cement businesses, we work to improve kiln energy efficiency and specific power consumption across our locations. Further efficiency is achieved through the internal integration of our operations and resources. For example, at Tarmac's Tunstead site, part of our Europe Materials Division, there is one established quarry servicing co-located aggregates, cement and lime production, resulting in optimised materials efficiency.\n\nCRH continues to place itself at the forefront of innovative solutions. In 2022 we introduced a Group-wide $250 million venturing and innovation fund to support our decarbonisation journey. With the support of this fund we have expanded both the number and range of research initiatives across our entire Group, including hydrogen use, CO 2 mineralisation projects, novel cements, AI technology and Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS).",

        "page_content": "## Decarbonisation continued\n\n## Investing in Innovative Technologies\n\nTo accelerate progress on decarbonisation, CRH is placing itself at the forefront of innovative solutions. As well as identifying new sources of alternative fuels and materials, our ICSC continues to develop novel, ground-breaking decarbonisation technologies to help realise our ambition of becoming net-zero by 2050. Developing carbon capture, utilisation and storage solutions, piloting new technologies to reduce carbon emissions during manufacturing, utilising concrete's ability to absorb CO 2 , as well as developing new solutions for the built environment, such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure, continue to be priorities in our innovation programme.\n\nBy decarbonising our business, we are not only accelerating our own actions to reduce carbon emissions, but we are also contributing to the decarbonisation efforts and net-zero ambitions across our industry and society. To further drive actions in this area, we have established a $250 million venturing and innovation fund, to help our operating companies and functions develop new ideas and bring value creating solutions to the market. Through CRH Ventures, our new venture capital unit, we are investing in, and partnering with, construction technology and climate technology companies to pilot and scale new technologies and innovations that will enable safer, smarter, and more sustainable construction. Our venturing and innovation fund supports our decarbonisation journey and demonstrates our continued commitment to investing in new technologies that will shape the built environment of tomorrow. This follows a strong record of innovation investment of approximately $1 billion every 10 years and builds on the numerous ongoing innovation projects that are being carried out across our operations.\n\n## Climate-related Financial Planning\n\nAddressing climate change is central to the Group's strategy. Our financial planning is targeted at solving the challenges that the built environment and society face now and in the future. We aim to play a pivotal role in providing a lower impact and climate-resilient built environment through the creation of long-term financial and societal value.\n\nCRH's strategy and financial planning process is designed to identify, evaluate, and manage significant risks and threats that could inhibit the Group from operating in a stable and sustainable manner. For more information on climate-related risk and opportunities, including impacts, time periods and influence on strategy, see pages 150 to 156. The Sustainability, Risk and Finance teams work closely to ensure that climaterelated considerations are integrated into the financial planning process to ensure that adequate capital expenditure, investments and operational capital is directed to achieving the organisation's financial and environmental objectives. Where opportunities arise in our businesses and markets, we are uniquely positioned to maximise the environmental and business benefit. We are creating value-added solutions to address the impacts of climate change to ensure that we can continue to drive growth and value for our business and support our customers and society in the transition to netzero.\n\nOur 2030 decarbonisation roadmap will require an incremental capital expenditure of approximately $150 million per annum to implement and execute. Further investment will be required beyond 2030 to deliver our net-zero ambition. In regions and countries where carbon trading schemes are in operation, facilities that fall within the scope of this legislation comply with CO 2 'cap and trade' and carbon tax schemes, including the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme and other regional schemes. With\n\na disciplined approach, alongside strict internal investment criteria, the net business benefit is expected to increase revenue and profitability, whilst safeguarding against future CO 2 costs and simultaneously creating superior customer and societal value. For further detail on our strategy for managing climate-related risks and opportunities see our TCFD Executive Summary on pages 56 to 59.\n\nAs part of our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) programme, we assess the climate-related risks and opportunities on a timeline relevant to the Group's science-based decarbonisation ambition. Our climate risk assessment and decarbonisation roadmap ensure the business is prepared and ready to manage and adapt to the challenges ahead. For further detail on our risk management processes for managing climate-related risks and opportunities see page 53.\n\n## Measuring our Performance\n\nWe continue to develop our disclosure practices to better measure and improve our performance across the value chain. CRH uses a variety of reliable, verifiable and objective metrics and targets to measure and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities. Internally, these inform the Group's risk governance, strategy, and management processes and help identify best practices and key improvement areas. We are also a long-term participant in CDP and were awarded an A- for our 2022 climate disclosures. As part of our reporting, we have included targets and performance against our targets for each climate-related risk and opportunity to illustrate our progress. This includes our non-financial KPI on Greenhouse Gas Emissions 1 Scope 1 and 2 absolute carbon emissions which has decreased by 7% in 2022. Our carbon emissions have reduced in the year as we execute against the levers in our decarbonisation roadmap, and lower clinker production (partially related to the temporary closing of our operations in Ukraine). We also saw an improvement in our cement specific net CO 2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product which reduced to 566kg (from 586kg in 2021).\n\n## EU Taxonomy\n\nIn Europe, operations are subject to national environmental laws and regulations, most of which now emanate from EU Directives and Regulations. The EU Taxonomy regulation is part of the EU's overall efforts to implement the European Green Deal. It is intended to serve as a standardised and mandatory classification system to determine which economic activities are considered as 'environmentally sustainable' by the EU. For CRH, only cement manufacturing is eligible under the taxonomy. On page 272 to 273 we report the proportion of total revenues, CapEx and operational expenditure in accordance with the eligibility and alignment to technical screening criteria.\n\nNON-FINANCIAL KPI NON-FINANCIAL KPI\n\n1.0 kg/$ Revenue (2021: 1.2 kg/$) Greenhouse Gas Emissions Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO 2 e Emissions (kg/$ Revenue)",

For reporting Scope 1 CO 2 lime emissions we use the Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 and 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. We calculate Scope 1 CO 2 e emissions from other activities using appropriate emission factors and in line with the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol (Revised Edition). These methodologies consider CO 2 e emissions from biomass fuels as climate neutral.\n\nWe calculate Scope 2 CO 2 e emissions from electricity in line with the method of the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance (2015), using 'International Energy Agency (2022) Emissions Factors' (published in 2022) and eGRID2020 'Summary Table' for emissions factors (published in 2022).\n\nFollowing a materiality analysis on sources of Scope 3 CO 2 e emissions, CRH has reaffirmed that the six categories listed above are the most relevant for our business. We calculate Scope 3 CO 2 e emissions estimations in line with the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 Standard and the GHG Protocol's Scope 3 Standard for cement companies, using the UK Government 'GHG conversion factors for company reporting 2022'. Reported Scope 3 CO 2 e emissions include the most relevant emissions categories for CRH operating company activities.\n\nCRH defines its organisational boundary on a financial control approach (entity driver based), and our Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions are reported on this basis.\n\nAll 2020 and 2021 numbers above are presented on a 'As Reported' basis consistent with CRH Sustainability Reports. In 2022 in order to better reflect our decisions on where we source power, we adopted market based Scope 2 carbon emissions approach (location-based equivalent is 2.3 million tonnes). Note the 2021 and 2020 Scope 2 emissions have not been restated from locationbased.\n\nFor the purposes of this report, all references to carbon emissions (CO 2 ) relate to CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e), which include the six Greenhouse gases listed in the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO 2 ); methane (CH 4 ); nitrous oxide (N 2 O); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ).

By taking a circular approach, we can reduce the use of primary resources in construction projects, leading to less intensive and more cost-effective development practices.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\nWe also see an opportunity to lead by example and promote a circular approach in the wider industry and society. This includes developing more circular designs through our modular and off-site manufacturing solutions, allowing for less complex product replacement and enhancement due to the design of the modular structures. In addition, off-site solutions also offer many other benefits, including improved time and cost predictability, reduced noise and traffic disruption during construction, and improved health and safety rates.\n\n## Enhancing Value Through Increased Circularity\n\nMinimising waste, using materials efficiently and using recycled waste, by-products and renewable resources are key components of CRH's sustainability framework and contribute to improving circularity in the built environment. We are a leader in the recycling and use of waste and byproducts from other industries as raw materials and fuels in our processes and products. We have an opportunity to increase further the use of renewable and recyclable materials to enable the resilient, resource efficient infrastructure and buildings needed to enhance modern living.\n\nOur operations use waste and by-products from both our own and other construction and industrial processes, such as recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) and recycled asphalt shingles (RAS), construction and demolition (C&D) waste, fly ash, ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), as well as using various wastes as fuel. For example, approximately 25% of every mile of road we build in North America is made from recycled materials. In addition, we work closely with partners, such as the World Building Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the GCCA, to help develop the innovative technologies and processes needed for the efficient reuse of byproducts in the most cost-effective way.\n\n- 1. Alternative raw materials and fuels are selected wastes and by-products which can be used to replace natural substances and fossil fuels. This metric demonstrates to investors our focus on the circular economy. We monitor this KPI in order to evaluate our performance in contributing to the circular economy which, as noted above, represents a growth opportunity for CRH.",

Extreme weather patterns associated with climate change, including droughts, floods and freezing events, are putting increasing pressure on our built environment and the water systems that support our cities, towns and communities. As a result, access to water resources, water scarcity and water management, including flood management, are among the most significant risks facing society today.\n\n## Delivering Solutions for Water Management\n\nAt CRH, we are committed to playing our part to overcome the global challenges associated with water management by conserving water at our own operations, as well as providing solutions to upgrade water infrastructure and enhance resilience to flooding.\n\nIn many regions vital water management infrastructure is old and designed for a climate that no longer exists. There is also the increasing demand for new water infrastructure to support growing communities. Continuing to deliver safe drinking water to millions of homes and businesses will require investment in the construction, maintenance and upgrading of water infrastructure to enhance the resilience of communities.\n\nAt CRH, we are committed to helping to solve the global challenges associated with water management and distribution. We have a significant role to play through our solutions to capture, treat, manage and distribute water resources efficiently. We continue to invest in the development of innovative new products and solutions to enhance further our end-to-end solutions offerings to our customers. For example, our acquisition in 2021 of NPP, Inc., a water, energy and infrastructure solutions business in the US, has increased our offering of safer, sustainable and effective solutions for water transmission and distribution, as well as sewer and wastewater infrastructure.\n\n## Enhancing Resilience to Extreme Weather Events\n\nIn addition to solving the challenges faced by water transmission and distribution, society is looking for enhanced sustainable solutions that help strengthen the resilience of cities and the wider built environment against coastal erosion and storm surges. CRH has a significant role to play in protecting communities through our products and solutions that enable effective management of water. This includes products used in flood defences, stormwater management systems and permeable paving products to manage urban stormwater run-off more effectively.\n\nWe also work to protect and rebuild our communities in the wake of extreme weather events. Concrete is inherently resilient, and the products and solutions offered by CRH are effective in protecting against flooding and helping to improve the storage capacities of flood water temporarily in stormwater systems during flood events. By replacing essential infrastructure, such as that needed to protect against coastal erosion, and designing products for resilient construction, we can help protect vulnerable coastlines and reduce the potential damage to properties, economic activities and infrastructure from flooding.\n\nIn addition to flood management, our products and solutions help to address challenges in drought-sensitive areas, through water capture, treatment and distribution, as well as through engineering measures to increase groundwater recharge, alleviating problems related to the extraction of groundwater.\n\n## Promoting Responsible Water Use\n\nWe practice and promote responsible water management across our operations, continuously aiming to reduce, reuse and recycle water and ensure that our activities do not endanger local surface water or groundwater. We continue to invest in new technologies and innovative processes to reduce water intake from utility sources and protect valuable local water resources. In addition, we were awarded an A- by CDP for our 2022 water security disclosures.\n\n- 1  As reported number in 2021 46% and restated in 2022 to reflect impact of discontinued operations.\n- 2  Products with enhanced sustainability attributes are defined as those products that incorporate any, or a combination of; recycled materials; are produced using alternative energy and fuel sources; have a lower-carbon footprint as compared to those produced using traditional manufacturing processes; and/or are designed to specifically benefit the environment (i.e. water treatment and management systems, products with strong thermal mass/U-values).\n\n.",

Our Global I&D Council, chaired by our Chief Executive, is responsible for driving the strategy and accountability for I&D across CRH. In addition, our I&D strategy is sponsored at executive level through the Group General Counsel and the newly appointed CCPO.\n\nWe have many initiatives underway to continue to build inclusion and address structural barriers in the workplace, such as gender equality. We have established I&D Committees across our Divisions and corporate offices to lead and embed change throughout CRH. In addition, many of our operating companies now have their own I&D plans in place at a local level. In addition, Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) have been established in some of our businesses to further embed our inclusive culture.\n\nWe closely monitor participation of women in our workforce as a whole and are committed to increasing the representation of women across the organisation. The percentage of women in senior management was 15% in 2022. In addition, we continued to focus on executing our I&D strategy across the Group. This is supported, for example, by our target of 33% women in senior leadership by 2030. As of 31 December 2022, 33% of the Directors of CRH plc and 19% of senior leadership were women.\n\nThe Board and management are committed to building an inclusive and diverse organisation, in which talented people of all backgrounds can work in an environment which enables them to perform at their best.

Our businesses are united through responsible leadership as we navigate the changing world.\n\nWe advance with intent and contribute to the delivery of global goals, such as the United Nations SDGs and the Paris Agreement. We are a constituent member of indices including the MSCI Leaders ESG Indexes, FTSE4Good Index, the STOXX\u00ae Global ESG Leaders Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). We recognise that partnership is key to progress in these areas. By collaborating across the value chain with a wide range of stakeholders, we are helping to advance our shared priorities.\n\nIn responding to ESG trends, we also use our influence and scale to promote sustainability initiatives by collaborating with NGOs and charitable organisations. In doing so we strengthen local relationships and champion the causes most important to society. Our contributions have been recognised and many of our operating companies have achieved awards for excellence in sustainability.\n\n## Driving our Sustainability Performance\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for CRH's sustainability performance to management through the Chief Executive. This includes ensuring sustainability policies are implemented in all business lines. We regularly review our sustainability policies and take a strategic approach in responding to global trends. Daily responsibility for ensuring that the Group's Environmental, Health and Safety and Social policies are effectively implemented lies with individual location managers, assisted by a network of Group specialists across the areas of environment, health and safety and human resources. In addition, we provide training to our employees to raise awareness of our performance standards and our sustainability policies and the importance of upholding them across our business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Responsible Business continued\n\nOur sustainability performance is monitored using KPIs across the areas of environment, safety and wellbeing, and social and employee matters. We have identified the most important ESG topics and KPIs for CRH through a range of internal and external processes. These include annual sustainability reporting by our businesses to the Group, review of issues raised through ERM processes and regular formal materiality assessment reviews, the outcomes of which guide our strategy and reporting. An overview of our materiality assessment process and outcomes will be included in our 2022 Sustainability Performance Report, which will be published in March 2023 on the CRH website, www.crh.com.\n\nThese internal and external processes allow us to monitor opportunities and risks and articulate what matters most to society. Our non-financial due diligence processes are well established in our business and supply chains, and we made no material changes to these in 2022.\n\nOur most relevant sustainability KPIs are provided on pages 24 to 49. We provide training to our employees to raise awareness of our performance standards and the importance of upholding them across our business. Our training and awareness tools include our non-financial policies and our CoBC. We comply with the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (see page 134 for more information) and the EU Taxonomy Regulation (see pages 270 to 273 for more information) and we make disclosures consistent with TCFD (see pages 56 to 59 for more information). In addition, our annual independently assured Sustainability Performance Report is prepared in line with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting standards. This includes additional information on environmental performance and social and employee matters.\n\n## Governance and Ethics\n\nCRH is committed to the highest level of legal, ethical and moral standards, complying with the law and working responsibly. We do not tolerate any illegal behaviour and all CRH companies respect and comply with the laws and obligations in the countries and regions in which they operate. A 'Speak-up' culture encourages employees, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders to raise good faith reportable concerns through a number of secure channels, including the CRH Hotline, where, if needed, the reporters can remain anonymous. Employees can speak to members of their management team, Legal and Compliance team or, in the case of fraud and theft, also to a dedicated Fraud Point of Contact in their business. We are strongly focused on protecting \"Speak-up\" reporters from retaliation, in accordance with the CRH \"Speak-up\" Policy and requirements of local laws.\n\nOur CoBC, available on crh.com/sustainability/codes-of-conduct, outlines clear expectations for employees related to business conduct. We take a zero-tolerance approach to bribery, corruption and fraud. Regular training on our CoBC is provided to all employees. Certain employees, based on risk profile, undertake annual Advanced Compliance Training (ACT), covering Anti-Bribery, Competition/Antitrust, Anti-Fraud and AntiTheft. Globally our senior management complete an Annual Compliance Certification, confirming their business's compliance with our CoBC and accompanying policies. Further detail on the CRH Hotline and CoBC awareness and training is set out on page 101.\n\nIn the US, CRH supports the rights of employees to participate in the political process through employee-funded Political Action Committees (PACs) and CRH's US operations provide administrative support (consistent with applicable laws) to their affiliated federal and state PACs.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We engage with suppliers to develop a responsible and sustainable supply chain needed to deliver innovative, sustainable products and solutions.\n\nThrough our SCoC, we continue to operate our core supplier due diligence processes to increase visibility and insights into our suppliers. These actions are taken with the goal of ensuring that good business practices are upheld throughout our supply chain. We continue to review our supply chain risks through our ERM Framework (see page 50 for more information).\n\nc. 10,700 (2021: c. 8,500)\n\nemployees completed ACT training in 2022\n\nc. 31,500 (2021: c. 32,600) employees completed CoBC training in 2022\n\nCASE STUDY\n\n## Supporting the transition to more sustainable supply chains\n\nWe are passionate about sustainable and resilient supply chains. For example, in 2022 Tarmac, part of our Europe Materials Division, launched its second Supplier Sustainability Week to drive the net-zero and wider sustainability agenda in partnership with its supply chain. This event consists of digital events and meetings covering everything from strategic industry insights to specialist presentations on areas such as I&D, renewable energy and sustainable packaging. The event also provided a platform to announce the winner of the Tarmac 2022 Innovation Challenge, which has been running since 2019. The focus of this year's challenge was 'energy efficiency or innovation resulting in improvements for the industry'. The winning entry was submitted by Prior Power Solutions for a hydrogen introduction system that can be fitted onto new or existing diesel engines that offers CO 2 reductions of up to 8%, which will be brought to life in partnership with Tarmac.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\n## Driving Better Decision-making\n\n## Our Risk Framework\n\nERM is a process embedded across the Group that provides a structured and consistent global approach to identifying, assessing and managing our most material threats and opportunities. Ultimately, the purpose of ERM is to assist our people in making better decisions by focusing decision-makers on taking the right risk for the right reward, encouraging effective and informed interaction with risk to protect and grow our business.\n\nOur ERM framework, aligned with Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) principles, provides a clear approach for our people to comprehensively identify and effectively manage the uncertainty our businesses face as they strive to create value for the Group.\n\nThe Board, supported by its sub-committees, is ultimately accountable for ensuring the Group takes the right risks aligned to our objectives, owning and approving the Group's risk management and internal control systems, and defining the Group's risk appetite.\n\nRisk workshops, facilitated by Group Risk, bring together leaders from across the Group to identify risks and opportunities, and define mitigation. Uncertainties that present themselves as downside risks are assessed in line with the Group's risk appetite and those which present themselves as opportunities are sufficiently explored and captured, where possible. To maximise value, ERM is integrated into our formal strategic planning and budgeting processes, and also at key day-to-day decision points. Doing so drives a risk-intelligent culture and underpins more informed and confident decision-making closer to the customer. Performance is our commitment and encouraging all employees to proactively manage risk creates a more agile and resilient organisation, which is reflected in this year's strong financial performance.\n\nThe Group Risk team supports the business by continuing to enhance our risk framework, processes and practices. In line with our pillar of empowered talent, the Group Risk team is supported by a network of risk champions, comprising senior leaders from every business, to provide continuous process advocacy and support formal activity, such as risk reporting and analysis. Strong tone at the top and robust governance structures ensure that risks and opportunities are reported in a timely manner and processes are implemented to minimise risks and maximise opportunities.\n\nOur framework enables us to be customer connected, allowing us to add depth to our understanding of our customers and markets and generate new ways to meet their needs. This is evident in how our integrated solutions strategy works with customers to find solutions to their challenges, minimising risks associated with large scale development, and allowing the Group to capture opportunities.\n\nFor a full overview of risk governance structures and key steps in our risk process, please see page 94 of the Audit Committee Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With our primary focus being the safety of our colleagues and their families, we worked to support the evacuation of those wishing to leave the country. Since then, operations have resumed and we continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nWith global supply chain issues already impacting most industries, the conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated these challenges with supply chain continuity being added as a principal risk for 2022. Whilst the Group has been relatively successful in managing continuity-related issues, we may face increasing challenges sourcing required raw materials (e.g. flyash, petcoke and energy) at economic rates.\n\nHighly volatile exchange rates also continue as a principal risk, given the significant volatility in 2022 in the performance of many of the Group's currencies relative to USD, the Group's reporting currency.\n\nWhilst Group capacity and financial performance remained strong in 2022 in the face of a challenging and volatile cost environment, and while we expect resilient demand and increased pricing in 2023, industry cyclicality\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n## Risk and Strategy:\n\n2022: Integration of outputs from our risk reporting processes into business strategic and financial planning processes\n\n2023: Further enhancement of our emerging risk framework and integration of outputs into operating company and Group strategic planning\n\n## Ownership and Reporting:\n\n2022: Group-wide deployment of our new Risk Management Information System (RMIS), which is driving transparency and actionable business insights\n\n2023: Formal assignment of all risks, mitigations and actions to specified owners that are subsequently held accountable for their management/delivery\n\nand economic conditions may continue to present risks to the Group in 2023.\n\nOur people are our priority and ensuring we have diverse and empowered talent at all levels of the organisation is core to the successful delivery of the Group's strategy. The Group has continued to focus on our people management programmes in 2022, implementing new programmes to mitigate challenges with attracting and retaining talent which could impact the Group's ability to successfully deliver on that strategy.\n\nWhilst we did not experience any material cyber-related incidents during the year, it remains a principal risk in light of the continually growing threat and an area in which the Group is directing additional resource (see case study on page 53).\n\nMore detailed information on our principal risks, their potential impact on the Group and how they are being mitigated can be found on pages 139 to 148 of the Directors' Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

While considered as part of our identification processes, the assessment of such risks can be difficult to quantify due to a lack of data or longer time horizons.\n\nWhile emerging risks are generally new and unknown (e.g. potentially relating to slowly evolving climate events, disruptive technologies etc.), they can also be known risks that have evolved to present new challenges for the Group.\n\nA dynamic watchlist of these exposures is maintained to enable early recognition of those threats that could impact the long-term performance of our business. Risks are tracked, with potential subsequent desktop research and/or engagement of internal and external subject matter experts and risk champions, with a focus on developing a better understanding of each exposure and beginning to build a strategy to more effectively manage the risk.\n\nThe Risk Committee reviews the watchlist and deems certain threats to be accepted risks, which are integrated into our risk register and are subject to oversight by the Risk and Audit Committees. Whilst the watchlist is primarily utilised as a mechanism to monitor emerging risks, the Group understands that associated opportunities may arise from developing a deep understanding of our emerging risks.\n\nKey emerging risks in this category include extreme weather events, which can present physical barriers to work onsite, dampen demand and hinder performance, and labour model disruption, where tightening labour pools materialise within our industry due to a negative convergence of demographic, educational and economic trends. A detailed description of emerging climate risks is disclosed on pages 150 to 156.\n\n## Managing our Climate Risks and Opportunities\n\nFour climate focused risk workshops, each facilitated by the Group Risk team, were undertaken with senior leaders across our Group functions and Divisions. Drawing on their deep sector, product and environmental experience, participants proposed perceived material risks and opportunities across 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C warming scenarios, for collective debate and assessment. The risks and opportunities were categorised using the TCFD framework, and classified as short (<3yrs), medium (to 2030) or long-term (to 2050), with mitigation and capture plans defined for those perceived most material. Outputs from the respective sessions have been consolidated and analysed, with insights to be used to inform business unit strategy planning and underpin scenario analysis for the climate-related disclosures contained on pages 155 to 156.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n## Tackling Cyber Risk\n\nWith the ever-evolving nature and frequency of cyber-attacks affecting organisations of all sizes, the Group has directed renewed focus on the management of potential exposures. 2022 has continued to see a significant increase in external threats with the manufacturing industry one of the key sectors targeted. With increasing threats, enhanced compliance requirements and a growing risk to industrial control and enterprise systems, CRH continues to invest significant resources in our cyber security defences, including:\n\n- \u00b7  the creation of a Global Information Security Council, which oversees cyber risk and key initiatives seeking to reduce associated threats;\n- \u00b7  the review and update of our cyber risk appetite, clarifying requirements in situations where it previously may have been unclear;\n- \u00b7  establishing a multi-year Cyber Essentials programme, setting out minimum standards across key areas, including user training, privilege access management, system patching, network segregation, etc.; and\n- \u00b7  a comprehensive assessment of our cyber controls environment to identify and prioritise vulnerabilities\n\n## Re-defining our Risk Appetite\n\nOur risk appetite defines the amount and types of risk that CRH is prepared to take to deliver on its objectives. Given the constantly evolving external risk environment as well as a shifting organisational focus to offer our customers sustainable integrated solutions, work was undertaken throughout 2022 to enhance our existing risk appetite framework. Focused on key areas of perceived risk, Group Risk engaged with senior stakeholders and subject matter experts from across the Group to identify areas of potential decision-making uncertainty where risks and opportunities for the Group may materialise. In articulating an acceptable risk appetite for each area, a Global Leadership Team member took ownership of each risk area and oversaw their definition utilising a combination of qualitative statements, and metrics. The new framework was approved by the Board in February 2023 and will be cascaded throughout Group leadership in 2023 to support decision-making.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Enhancing Decision-Making with Risk Data\n\nOver the course of 2022, the Group deployed a new RMIS, which has been integrated into businesses and functions across our global operations. Developed in conjunction with our businesses, the system enables real-time capture and visibility of risk data, promoting transparency, accountability, and awareness of exposures that could have material implications for our business. We continued to invest in our people and to grow the skills required to drive our business, training over 600 employees to use this risk technology during 2022.\n\nAlgorithms built into dashboards automatically filter risks to help leaders effectively prioritise those for review, and provide risk owners with a 'point in time' view of exposures and the effectiveness of mitigation activity, supporting the management of risks to within our defined risk appetite levels. The system underpins our bottom-up risk reporting, easily consolidating risks at all levels throughout the Group and has helped provide a more time-sensitive analysis of risk, expanding and building our strength through scale, and shaping and making our businesses better.\n\n## Turning Risk into Reward\n\nRapidly changing political, social, economic and environmental factors inherently present material uncertainty for our business and major stakeholders. Our ERM framework provides a structured approach for our people to consistently manage risk, whilst positioning us to capitalise on identified opportunities.\n\n## Deep Stakeholder Collaboration\n\nCRH recognises that climate change presents significant risks and opportunities that may materially affect the Group's operational and financial performance, and that collaboration across internal and external stakeholders is integral to our ability to move at speed to deliver our sustainability targets and ambitions. The agreement CRH signed with Shell in 2022 exemplifies this commitment, and will see the businesses collaborate and share learnings across Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific to explore, develop and deploy decarbonisation solutions and technologies at scale, including vehicle electrification and charging infrastructure, low-carbon fuels and asphalt solutions, and renewable electricity generation.\n\n## Driving Continuous Innovation\n\nRapidly evolving construction trends present material opportunity for those able to anticipate and quickly move to meet customers' increasingly complex needs. In seeking to capitalise this opportunity, CRH Ventures was established in 2022 with access to a $250 million venturing and innovation fund to innovate, pilot and scale cutting-edge technologies and solutions with the potential to reinvent the built environment. One of its early investments was in AICrete, which combines data and artificial intelligence to create a unique 'recipe-as-a-service' platform to optimise local materials and minimise the amount of cement used, reducing CO 2 emissions and the cost of concrete production. Recognising that there can be no opportunity without risk, the Group continues to cultivate a 'safe to innovate' culture, creating space for teams to be courageous and creative in their pursuit of transformative market solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We comply with the four TCFD recommendations and the 11 recommended disclosures as set out in Figure 4 of Section C of the report entitled 'Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' published in June 2017 by the TCFD. These are detailed throughout this Annual Report and a crossreferencing map can be seen on page 59.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board is responsible for promoting the long-term success of the Group, generating value for shareholders and ensuring we make a positive contribution to society. Its role includes providing leadership; establishing and monitoring the Group's purpose, values, and strategy; setting the Group's risk appetite; and ensuring there is a robust framework of effective controls to enable risks and opportunities, including those related to climate change, to be successfully assessed and managed.\n\nSustainability, including the impacts of climate change, is embedded in the Group's strategy and business model. The Board recognises the importance of decarbonisation to address the challenges of climate change and believes the Group's integrated strategy of value-added products and innovative solutions have a key role to play in delivering a more resilient and sustainable built environment. Our Governance Report beginning on page 80, provides our framework for addressing climate-related issues.

For more information on the management of climate change see pages 150 to 154.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Group's strategy and financial planning is designed to identify, evaluate, and manage significant risks that could inhibit the group from successfully operating. Our financial planning takes into consideration the multidimensional impacts of climate change on the Group's activities. For more information on how climate considerations are incorporated into the Group's strategy, see pages 150 to 154.\n\nThe Group has identified climate-related risks and opportunities that could impact us in the short (<3 years), medium (to 2030) and longterm (to 2050) using the TCFD's framework. We assessed these factors qualitatively, informed by warming scenario key assumptions and supported where possible with top-down quantitative assessments. We have provided an overview of the material climate-related risks and opportunities and how they impact our businesses, strategy and financial planning in our risks and opportunities disclosure on pages 150 to 154.\n\nBuilding on our climate-related risk and opportunity analysis, CRH also conducted in 2022 a detailed quantitative assessment on two of these risks; carbon pricing and adverse weather, as a first step in undertaking detailed quantification of all risks and opportunities. For more information on the processes, assumptions, and outputs of the Group's climate scenario analysis, see pages 155 and 156.\n\nThe overall assessment identified a number of transitional and physical risks and opportunities, which may adversely or positively impact the operational and financial performance of the Group. The impacts were considered both with and without any mitigation or adaptation actions CRH may take. CRH continually assesses its strategy, business model and ongoing business performance to make sure that they are driving sustainable growth and value creation for its stakeholders. Based on this assessment, the Group believes it has sufficient flexibility and resilience to successfully manage its climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\n## Advancing innovative solutions for carbon reduction\n\nWe use innovative processes to reinvent our products and to support our ambition to decarbonise our operations and the built environment. For example, Tarmac, part of our Europe Materials Division, has become a sector leader through the use of its ULTILOW products, a range of high performing, durable, warmmix asphalts which use lower temperatures in the manufacturing process to reduce carbon by up to 15%. In 2022 Tarmac have led the way in the UK market by making ULTILOW the default asphalt for virtually all road surfacing applications instead of the traditional hot-mix option.",

To understand more about our processes for identifying, assessing, and managing risk, please see our Risk Governance section on pages 50 to 54.\n\nRisks are identified through a number of different forums, such as champion forums, engagement with senior leaders and other stakeholders and through other channels. During 2022, CRH undertook a number of workshops across our three Divisions to identify how climate-related risks could adversely impact the Group and how potential opportunities could create value and contribute to a more resilient built environment. The size and significance of each risk is determined according to assessed impact on the organisation and its likelihood of occurrence. A list of the climaterelated risks and opportunities identified can be seen on pages 150 to 154.\n\n## Metrics and Targets\n\nCRH uses a variety of metrics and targets to measure and manage our climate-related risks and opportunities. Internally, these inform the Group's risk governance, strategy, and management processes. Externally, they allow investors and other stakeholders to assess the Group's performance over time and provide a sound basis for comparison with industry peers.\n\nOur climate-related targets are set by the Global Leadership Team and approved by our SESR Committee, which evaluates these targets annually. In 2022, CRH adopted its industry-leading SBTi validated target 25% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030 (from a 2020 base year). In early 2023, the SBTi validated our revised targets 1 in line with the updated 1.5\u00b0C science-based framework which now equate to a 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030 (from a 2021 base year). For more information see page 31.\n\nOur climate-related targets are linked to our remuneration policy. For our 2022 Performance Share Plan (PSP), 15% relates to ESG metrics, of which 10% are specific to climate. Our PSP is an effective mechanism for incentivising progress towards a more sustainable built environment, recognising the long-term nature of our targets.\n\nTo monitor performance and the implementation of our sustainability strategy, where appropriate key performance indicators and related targets are defined for each climate-related risk and opportunity. To facilitate comparative and trend analysis, our climate-related metrics are disclosed consistently from year to year and our targets have a defined time horizon. See more on pages 150 to 154.\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting team is responsible for monitoring the Group's climate-related metrics and progress being made towards targets through our Annual Sustainability Review process.\n\n- 1: Refer to page 27 for further detail on our decarbonisation targets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our performance reflects the continued execution of our integrated and sustainable solutions strategy.\n\n|                               | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net Debt/EBITDA (as defined)* | 0.9x   | 1.3x   |\n| Interest-bearing loans and    |        |        |\n| borrowings/Profit after tax   | 2.5x   | 4.0x   |\n| Return on net assets (RONA)   | 13.3%  | 12.3%  |\n| Return on net segment assets  | 13.7%  | 12.1%  |\n\nGroup sales of $32.7 billion (2021: $29.2 billion) were 12% ahead of 2021 reflecting solid commercial progress, resilient underlying demand and the strength of our business model. Year-end net debt of $5.1 billion (2021: $6.3 billion) was reflective of our continued strong cash generation, and efficient allocation and reallocation of capital. Net acquisition spend totalled $3.3 billion (2021: $1.5 billion) in the year and total distributions to shareholders were $2.1 billion (2021: $1.8 billion). Net Debt/EBITDA (as defined)* 2 was 0.9x (2021: 1.3x).\n\n## Segmental Reviews\n\nThe sections on pages 68 to 79 outline the scale of CRH's operations in 2022 and provide a more detailed review of performance in each of CRH's reporting segments. A review of the Building Envelope business, which was divested in April 2022 and has been classified within discontinued operations, is also included on page 75.\n\n## Key Components of 2022 Performance\n\nAmericas Materials delivered a strong performance with total sales 15% above 2021 levels and like-for-like sales 3 12% ahead driven primarily by solid price progression across all lines of business.\n\nBuilding Products maintained good activity levels as demand for critical utility infrastructure and outdoor living solutions remained resilient. This, together with strong performances from recent acquisitions, delivered total sales growth of 26%. Like-for-like sales were 11% ahead of 2021.\n\nEurope Materials like-for-like sales were also 11% ahead reflecting continued strong pricing progress which offset the impact of lower activity levels. Total sales were in line with 2021 due to the impact of adverse currency translation effects.\n\nGroup EBITDA (as defined)* of $5.6 billion (2021: $5.0 billion) was 13% ahead despite the backdrop of significant cost inflation, reflecting the benefits of our integrated solutions strategy together with resilient demand and continued commercial progress.\n\nThis improved profitability, coupled with our ongoing focus on balance sheet optimisation, resulted in a further increase in returns with RONA increasing by 100 basis points (bps) to 13.3% (2021: 12.3%).\n\nReported profit after tax was ahead of 2021 at $3.9 billion (2021: $2.6 billion) driven by the strong trading performance and with this year's profit augmented by the profit on disposal of the Building Envelope business.\n\n- 1 See cautionary statement regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 135.\n- 2 Net Debt/EBITDA (as defined)* is a non-GAAP measure as defined on page 260. The GAAP figures that are most directly comparable to the components of Net Debt/EBITDA (as defined)* include: interest-bearing loans and borrowings: (2022: $9,636 million, 2021: $10,487 million) and profit after tax (2022: $3,874 million, 2021: $2,621 million).\n- 3 Details of how non-GAAP measures are calculated are set out on pages 257 to 260.\n- *EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' profit after tax.",

Including the trading contribution and profit on disposal of our discontinued operations, total earnings per share was $5.07 (2021: $3.29).\n\nThe US Dollar strengthened against most major currencies during 2022 resulting in the average US Dollar/euro rate strengthening from 0.8460 in 2021 to 0.9518 in 2022 and likewise the US Dollar/Pound Sterling rate strengthening from an average of 0.7270 in 2021 to 0.8120 in 2022. Overall currency movements resulted in an unfavourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown in the table above.\n\nThe average and year-end 2022 exchange rates of the major currencies impacting on the results of the Group are set out on page 190.\n\n## Sales Revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources - 2022 compared with 2021\n\nThe comments that follow refer to the major components of the Group's cash flows for 2022 and 2021 as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 180.\n\n2022 marked another year of strong cash generation for the Group, with net cash inflow from operating activities of $4.0 billion (2021: $4.2 billion) lower than prior year as a result of higher tax outflows related to profits on divestments. The net movement in inventories, receivables, payables and provisions was an outflow of $518 million (2021: $228 million outflow). Working capital was $2.9 billion at year-end (2021: $2.5 billion) representing 8.8% (2021: 8.5%) of sales. CRH believes that its working capital levels are sufficient for the Group's present requirements.\n\nIn 2022 focused investment in development and replacement capital expenditure amounted to $1.5 billion (2021: $1.6 billion). This investment is made in anticipation of increasing demand in future years, together with incremental capital expenditure investment related to the delivery of our absolute gross carbon emissions reduction target. Spend in 2022 represented 109% of depreciation on owned assets (2021: 110%).\n\nReflective of the continued execution of the Group's strategy and the creation of value through the efficient allocation and reallocation of capital during 2022, the Group invested $3.3 billion (2021: $1.5 billion) in strategic acquisitions which was financed by divestment and disposal proceeds 1 of $3.9 billion (2021: $0.5 billion).\n\nReflecting our strong financial position and commitment to returning cash to shareholders the Group continued its ongoing share buyback programme in 2022 repurchasing 29.8 million (2021: 17.8 million) ordinary shares for a total consideration of $1.2 billion (2021: $0.9 billion).\n\nThese buybacks, together with cash dividend payments of $0.9 billion (2021: $0.9 billion), reflect the Group's continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings were $9.6 billion (2021: $10.5 billion) at 31 December 2022 and corresponding year-end net debt of $5.1 billion (2021: $6.3 billion) reflects healthy inflows from operations and proceeds from the Building Envelope divestment. The Group is in a strong financial position and is well funded.",

At year-end, the Group had sufficient cash balances to meet all maturing debt obligations (including leases) for the next five years and the weighted average maturity of the remaining term debt was 12.2 years.\n\nA CHF330 million Swiss Franc denominated bond was repaid on maturity in September 2022.\n\nThe Group also has a $2.0 billion US Dollar Commercial Paper Programme and a \u20ac1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Programme of which there were no outstanding issued notes at year-end. The purpose of these programmes is to provide short-term liquidity at attractive terms as required.\n\nContractual obligations and off-Balance Sheet arrangements are disclosed on page 274 of this Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nJim Mintern Chief Financial Officer\n\n## Development Review\n\n## 2022\n\nThe Group invested $3.3 billion on 29 acquisitions in 2022 (including deferred and contingent consideration in respect of prior year acquisitions) and a further $1.5 billion on development and replacement capital expenditure projects. On the divestment front, the Group completed nine transactions and realised total business and asset disposal proceeds of $3.9 billion, primarily relating to the proceeds from the Building Envelope divestment.\n\nThe largest acquisition in 2022 was in our Building Products Division where the Group completed its acquisition of Barrette, North America's leading provider of residential fencing and railing solutions, for $1.9 billion. This acquisition complements and enhances our offering of sustainable outdoor living solutions in North America. In addition, Building Products completed a further seven acquisitions in the US and two in Europe amounting to a total spend of $2.7 billion. The Americas Materials Division completed ten solutions-focused acquisitions in the US for a total spend of $0.5 billion, and the Europe Materials Division completed nine bolt-on acquisitions for $0.1 billion, the largest of which was the acquisition of a precast business in Denmark.\n\nThe largest divestment in 2022 was the Building Envelope business for cash proceeds of $3.5 billion (enterprise value of $3.8 billion including lease liabilities transferred of $0.3 billion). A further eight divestments were completed across the Group realising total proceeds of $0.2 billion. In addition to these business divestments, the Group realised proceeds of $0.1 billion from the disposal of surplus property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets.\n\nFurthermore, $52 million cash proceeds were received during the year relating to divestments in prior years, of which $49 million related to deferred consideration received for the divestment of the Group's equity interest in My Home Industries (MHIL) in India.",

Year-end net debt of $6.3 billion (2020: $5.9 billion) was reflective of our continued strong cash generation, disciplined capital expenditure and value-focused investments. Net acquisition spend totalled $1.5 billion (2020: $0.4 billion) and total distributions to shareholders were $1.8 billion (2020: $0.9 billion). Net Debt/ EBITDA (as defined)* was 1.3x (2020: 1.4x).\n\n## Key Components of 2021 Performance\n\nAmericas Materials benefited from increased construction activity in 2021 due to strong residential demand in North America. Underlying good operating performance offset the impacts of higher input costs and inclement weather. Like-for-like sales in 2021 increased by 6% against 2020, due to positive volume growth and pricing progression.\n\nBuilding Products delivered like-for-like sales 7% ahead of 2020, driven by strong demand for residential construction and a moderate recovery in the non-residential sector. Building Envelope, which is classified within discontinued operations for reporting purposes, saw sales increase by 4% in 2021 driven by strong pricing and good demand due to early signs of recovery in the non-residential market.\n\nEurope Materials saw like-for-like sales 11% ahead of 2021 reflecting good volume growth, and pricing progress against a 2020 comparative which was heavily impacted by pandemic restrictions. Positive pricing actions and strong fixed cost control offset cost inflation headwinds.\n\nEBITDA (as defined)* of $5.0 billion (2020: $4.3 billion) was 16% ahead reflecting the benefits of our integrated solutions strategy together with strong demand growth and continued commercial discipline.\n\nReported profit after tax was significantly ahead of 2020 at $2.6 billion (2020: $1.2 billion) driven by a strong trading performance and the nonrecurrence of non-cash impairment charges and one-off restructuring costs in 2020.\n\nThe US Dollar strengthened against most major currencies by the end of 2021. However, during 2021 the US Dollar weakened against most major\n\ncurrencies resulting in the average US Dollar/euro rate weakening from 0.8771 in 2020 to 0.8460 in 2021 and likewise the US Dollar/Pound Sterling weakening from an average 0.7798 in 2020 to 0.7270 in 2021.\n\nOverall currency movements resulted in a favourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown in the table above. The average and year-end 2021 exchange rates of the major currencies impacting on the Group are set out on page 190.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources - 2021 compared with 2020\n\nThe comments that follow refer to the major components of the Group's cash flows for 2021 and 2020 as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 180.\n\nDespite significantly increased trading activity compared to 2020, the Group remained focused on cash management. Management delivered a net working capital outflow of $228 million (2020: $196 million inflow) and the Group's operating cash flow increased to $4.2 billion (2020: $3.9 billion). Working capital was $2.5 billion at year-end (2020: $2.4 billion) representing 8.5% of sales (2020: 9.3%).\n\nFocused investment in property, plant and equipment in markets and businesses with increased demand and efficiency requirements, resulted in higher cash outflows of $1.6 billion (2020: $1.0 billion), with spend in 2021 representing 110% of depreciation on owned assets (2020: 74%).\n\nReflective of the ongoing strategy of active portfolio management, the Group invested $1.5 billion in bolt-on acquisitions (2020: $0.4 billion) which was partly financed by divestment and disposal proceeds 1 of $0.5 billion (2020: $0.3 billion).\n\nReflecting our strong financial position and commitment to returning cash to shareholders, the Group continued its share buyback programme in 2021 repurchasing 17.8 million (2020: 6.0 million) ordinary shares for a total consideration of $0.9 billion (2020: $0.2 billion). These buybacks, together with cash dividend payments of $0.9 billion (2020: $0.7 billion), reflect the Group's continued commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nYear-end interest-bearing loans and borrowings were $10.5 billion (2020: $12.2 billion) and year-end net debt of $6.3 billion (2020: $5.9 billion) reflects strong inflows from operations and an increase in disciplined capital expenditure and value-focused investments.",

These construction projects include federal, provincial, state, and local government authority road and infrastructure projects.\n\nDemand momentum in 2022 was underpinned in particular by federaland state-level infrastructure funding along with continued residential and commercial activity, including robust warehouse construction activity.\n\n## Creating Value\n\nCRH has built leadership positions in attractive construction markets across the US and Canada. These positions are supported by a network of strong reserves at quarry locations predominantly adjacent to and serving urban areas where demand is strongest. Our local businesses leverage their strong market knowledge, deep industry expertise and extensive array of essential materials to implement our differentiated strategy, offering value-add, end-to-end solutions which combine different types of materials, products, and services to satisfy multiple customer segment needs. This enables us to provide a unique, value enhancing, one-stop-shop experience saving time and reducing logistical complexity for our customers. This helps deepen our relationships and increase the share of wallet our customers spend with us.\n\nIn addition, our operations are vertically integrated enabling us to optimise production throughout the value chain. Essential materials produced by our aggregates and cement businesses for example are supplied to our downstream materials businesses for use in products such as readymixed concrete and asphalt.\n\n- 1 Net Assets at 31 December 2022 comprise segment assets less segment liabilities excluding lease liabilities as defined on page 260.\n- 2 Sector exposure and end-use balance are based on sales.\n- 3 Throughout this document annualised volumes have been used which reflect the full-year impact of development activity during the year and may vary from actual volumes sold.\n- *EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' profit after tax.",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\nBusiness Performance & Segmental Reviews\n\nGovernance\n\nThis approach is fundamental to our development strategy and sets CRH apart within our industry. The largely unconsolidated US building materials market presents further opportunities for value creation by allowing us to continue to identify and acquire businesses that can be efficiently integrated into our existing network and support our strong culture of safety and ongoing efforts towards a more inclusive and diverse workforce. An example of how we have been doing this is by collaborating with educational institutions to equip younger generations with the core skills needed within our industry and enable underrepresented individuals to access university. The CRH Canada Bridge Scholarship Program builds equity, diversity and inclusion by providing financial aid to students from underrepresented and underserved communities. In 2022 there were nine recipients from across Canada who were awarded a CRH Canada Bridge Scholarship, an example of how CRH also creates social value in the communities in which it operates.\n\n## How our Integrated Solutions Strategy Enhanced a Transport Infrastructure Project\n\nCRH provided a uniquely integrated highway construction solution which helped the Michigan Department of Transport (MDOT) reduce cost, decrease complexity, and save time when replacing 120 lane miles of freeway, and rehabilitating and replacing 27 bridges on Interstate Highway I-69. CRH employed its specialised design and engineering expertise to help MDOT create a single end-to-end design plan, integrating a variety of materials, products, and services into a single efficient construction solution, shortening the construction time from eight years to just three.\n\nThe customer also benefited from CRH's extensive experience in water management infrastructure. Our team worked with project architects and engineers to devise and implement an environmentally friendly solution which incorporated culverts and drainage systems from CRH's Infrastructure Products Group. CRH also helped to enhance the sustainability attributes of the project by providing recycled asphalt and innovative asphalt mix designs. These technologies will ensure the road surface performs above specification for the complex freeze-thaw requirements of MDOT due to Michigan's harsh climate.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n## Empowering Sustainable Solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCRH's vision is to develop sustainable solutions that build, connect, and improve our world. In 2022 we joined the NAPA 'The Road Forward' initiative which aims to achieve net-zero carbon emission asphalt pavements.\n\nIncreasing our use of RAP will be critical to reducing emissions and in 2022 we further expanded our use of RAP in Michigan where our Cadillac Asphalt business began to utilise RAP for the first time.\n\nIn addition to improving the sustainability attributes of our asphalt products, we also continued to make progress in other areas. For example, our American Rock Products business developed a specialised new sustainable readymixed concrete mix which can lower the carbon footprint of concrete used in data centres in Oregon by up to 23%.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\n<!-- image -->",

Operating profit was 10% ahead of 2020. Solid volume and pricing progression across all lines of business coupled with operating efficiencies offset the inflationary input cost environment. Like-for-like sales were 6% ahead of 2020, while like-for-like EBITDA (as defined)* increased by 7%.\n\nUS construction activity recovered in 2021 with increased residential demand along with a moderate recovery in non-residential markets. Infrastructure funding levels were maintained at similar levels to 2020. Canada experienced continued strong demand within its residential sector.\n\nDuring 2021 Americas Materials completed eight acquisitions in the US and Canada for a total spend of $0.7 billion, the largest of which was the acquisition of Angel Brothers Enterprises, an asphalt paving and infrastructure solutions business in Texas. The divestment of the Brazil cement operations was completed in the first half of 2021 for consideration of $0.2 billion.\n\n## Materials\n\nAggregates volumes were 3% ahead of 2020 on a like-for-like basis driven by good demand in our Northeast, Great Lakes and West divisions. The South division was negatively impacted by adverse weather particularly in the first half of 2021. Our selling prices improved 4% on a mix-adjusted basis, resulting in good margin expansion overall.\n\nLike-for-like asphalt volumes were 2% ahead of 2020, while like-for-like average prices also increased. Good market conditions in the Northeast, Great Lakes and West offset unfavourable weather conditions in the South.\n\nReadymixed concrete volumes were 4% ahead on a total and like-for-like basis as residential demand remained strong; good commercial discipline delivered price increases of 5%.\n\nPaving and construction revenues were 7% ahead of 2020, and 1% behind on a like-for-like basis, due to unfavourable weather in the South and a slower start to the season in both Great Lakes and Northeast. Revenues were higher in the West driven by an early start to the construction season and solid underlying demand. Construction margins were ahead of 2020.\n\n2\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nSales in the Northeast were ahead as volumes improved following 2020 which was impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Higher volumes and pricing across all lines of business were offset by higher input costs resulting in operating profit in line with 2020.\n\nGreat Lakes sales were ahead of 2020 driven by solid residential and commercial demand. Operating profit growth was led by good commercial and operational performance offsetting higher input costs.\n\nSouth sales were ahead of 2020 driven primarily by positive pricing and continued growth in readymixed concrete volumes in our Florida and Texas markets. Operating profit marginally declined as an improved commercial and operational performance was offset by the impacts of unfavourable weather and higher input costs.\n\nSales in the West were well ahead of 2020, driven by robust demand and positive pricing across all lines of business. Operating profit improved as higher volumes and prices coupled with cost saving initiatives offset higher input costs.\n\n## Cement\n\nOur cement business delivered a strong performance driven by a growth in sales which were 12% and 11% ahead of 2020 on a total and like-forlike basis respectively. Operating profit was ahead of 2020 driven by a 5% increase in volume, strong price realisation and cost saving measures which offset increases in input costs. Both US and Canada volumes were ahead of 2020 due to good market demand and strong backlog execution.",

EBITDA (as defined)* of $2.7 billion and operating profit of $1.9 billion were 6% and 7% ahead of 2021 respectively, as positive pricing was impacted by higher input costs. Likefor-like sales and EBITDA (as defined)* were 12% and 5% ahead of 2021 respectively.\n\nConstruction market growth remained positive in 2022, primarily driven by strong infrastructure activity, supported by increases in federal, state and local transportation funding. The non-residential market remained resilient, while parts of the new-build residential market faced challenges from rising interest rates and affordability constraints. Canada experienced solid growth in most provinces; however, rising interest rates and inflationary pressures negatively impacted the residential market.\n\nDuring 2022, Americas Materials completed ten solutions-focused acquisitions across the US with a total spend of $0.5 billion. The largest of these was the acquisition of Hinkle Contracting Company, a vertically integrated materials and road solutions business in Kentucky.\n\n## Materials\n\nAggregates volumes declined by 1% compared to 2021 as strong volumes in the South and Great Lakes divisions were offset by unfavourable weather which impacted activity in the Northeast and West divisions. Aggregates prices increased by 10%, driven by strong commercial management.\n\nAsphalt volumes were 3% ahead, driven by increases in the Great Lakes and South divisions, while volumes were lower in the Northeast and West divisions. Asphalt prices increased by 20% compared to prior year.\n\nReadymixed concrete volumes were 6% behind 2021 levels, impacted by less favourable weather conditions in the West and the Northeast. Strong commercial discipline delivered higher prices across all divisions, 14% ahead of 2021, which offset raw materials and energy cost inflation.\n\nPaving and construction revenues were 25% ahead of 2021 due to a strong order book and good project execution.\n\n3\n\n## Regional Performance\n\nSales in the Northeast division were 10% ahead of 2021 as prices improved across all lines of business offsetting lower volumes due to less favourable weather. Operating profit increased, driven by improved pricing which offset lower volumes and higher input costs.\n\nGreat Lakes sales were 20% ahead of 2021, led by improved pricing across all lines of business and solid construction demand. Growth in operating profit was achieved through strong commercial management and ongoing cost control, offsetting input cost inflation.\n\nSouth division sales were 26% ahead of 2021 with volumes ahead of prior year. Pricing was strong across all lines of business. Operating profit marginally declined as strong pricing was offset by increases in energy and bitumen costs.\n\nThe West division delivered 10% sales growth, driven primarily by disciplined commercial management across all lines of business and strong construction revenues. Unfavourable weather and a late start to the season impacted volumes. Operating profit was slightly ahead of 2021 as lower volumes were offset by improved pricing.\n\n## Cement\n\nOur cement division delivered sales growth of 8% driven primarily by price realisation of 12% which offset slightly lower volumes compared with 2021. Operating profit was ahead driven by strong price progression amid an inflationary cost environment.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures",

By way of example, Leviat, part of our Construction Accessories platform, formed an Inclusion and Diversity Council to help build a more inclusive workplace and culture across its businesses, and to reflect the communities in which it operates. Leviat developed a roadmap of initiatives in support of the Council that includes a calendar of events to raise awareness of local customs and traditions of its employees globally and a network of I&D champions to support its I&D priorities. By celebrating diversity, Leviat aims to cultivate the inclusive culture that will help it build a stronger global organisation. This helps Leviat to differentiate itself in the market and ultimately adds value for Leviat's customers.\n\n## Customer Collaboration on Complex Challenges\n\nOne of the ways that CRH is living its Purpose and reinventing the way the world is built is by being connected with our customers. In the US, where CRH is a market leader in water infrastructure solutions, our businesses collaborated with the owners of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to design a bespoke stormwater management solution that could capture, clean and infiltrate 45,000 cubic feet of stormwater to meet strict local stormwater quality requirements. The unique system which was required to collect, treat, and detain stormwater before it can leave the site needed to meet complex requirements such as sitespecific constraints and compliance requirements at the world's third busiest airport.\n\nCRH worked closely with the customer and its architects and engineers to understand the unique needs of the project and design and install a custom-built stormwater solution that is helping to change how LAX handles stormwater. CRH provided a one-stop-shop and single point of contact delivering value for the customer at several different phases of the project.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n## Sustainable Living\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022 our Architectural Products business expanded its MoistureShield plant in Arkansas, doubling the plant's manufacturing capacity. MoistureShield is a decking product made with up to 95% recycled materials, reducing the consumption of limited natural resources, making valuable use of waste and curbing carbon emissions. The expansion into its supply chain is helping CRH to further integrate recycled materials to its supply chain while helping to meet the growing demand for sustainable outdoor living products in the North American market.\n\nCRH sees significant opportunity in the increasing demand for sustainable infrastructure solutions. In Europe, NAL Limited, a CRH company which is based in the UK and specialises in transport infrastructure solutions launched an innovative new Electric Vehicle (EV) charging solution which allows for the installation of EV charging points which are future-proofed for rapid future evolution in EV charging technology.\n\nCASE STUDY\n\n<!-- image -->",

Ongoing business improvement initiatives delivered higher margins through production efficiencies, good commercial management, procurement savings and overhead cost control. EBITDA (as defined)* increased by 19% while operating profit was 25% ahead. Like-for-like sales were 7% ahead of 2020, while like-for-like EBITDA (as defined)* increased by 9%.\n\nDuring 2021 Building Products completed seven bolt-on acquisitions, primarily in the US and across all product platforms, at a total spend of $0.7 billion. The largest acquisition was Infrastructure Products' purchase of NPP, a water, energy and infrastructure solutions business.\n\n## Architectural Products\n\nArchitectural Products in North America delivered strong sales growth in 2021, reflecting positive market demand and robust residential RMI activity. Operating profit increased due to improved pricing and volume growth, a continued focus on operational improvements and strong overhead cost control. Sales in our European businesses were slightly ahead, with operating profit growth driven by operational and commercial excellence initiatives and improved product mix.\n\n## Infrastructure Products\n\nInfrastructure Products experienced strong sales growth in 2021. Sales to the communications and utilities sectors were resilient and demand for IT infrastructure was strong. The business delivered increased operating profit due to continued performance improvement measures and good cost control. Total sales and operating profit also benefited from the acquisition of NPP in the third quarter. Our European businesses contributed to the strong sales growth and operating profit was ahead. Our Australian business experienced lower sales due to COVID-19 restrictions which hindered production and limited deliveries.\n\n2\n\n## Construction Accessories\n\nLike-for-like sales in Construction Accessories were ahead of 2020 driven by strong volumes as the business benefited from higher residential demand and project activity. Sales growth was primarily led by North America, the UK and France. Increased sales and continued cost saving initiatives more than offset input cost inflation, resulting in like-for-like operating profit ahead of 2020.\n\n## Building Envelope (Discontinued Operations)\n\nBuilding Envelope's sales increased driven by strong pricing and early signs of recovery in the non-residential market. Operating profit was ahead of 2020 driven by improved pricing, operational excellence initiatives and other cost savings, partly offset by input cost inflation.",

This, combined with continued strong cost control and production efficiencies resulted in EBITDA (as defined)* 52% ahead of prior year and operating profit 59% ahead, 18% ahead and 20% ahead respectively on a like-for-like basis. This demonstrates the strong contribution from both the underlying businesses and recent acquisitions underpinned by our integrated solutions strategy.\n\nBuilding Products completed ten acquisitions during 2022, mainly in the US, for a total spend of c. $2.7 billion. The largest acquisition was the purchase in July 2022 of Barrette, North America's leading provider of fencing and railing solutions for the outdoor living space.\n\n## Architectural Products\n\nArchitectural Products in North America delivered strong sales growth in 2022, as sustained RMI activity offset the impact of rising interest rates on certain parts of new-build residential construction activity. Underlying demand in our European businesses was solid, particularly in Poland; however total sales were slightly behind 2021 due to currency headwinds. Pricing progress, improved operational performance and contributions from acquisitions resulted in operating profit ahead of prior year in both North America and Europe despite cost inflation and raw materials shortages. The integration of Barrette is progressing well with trading in line with expectations and good synergy delivery.\n\n## Infrastructure Products\n\nInfrastructure Products experienced strong sales growth in 2022, particularly in North America, with robust demand in the communications, energy, water and transportation sectors as well as strong contributions from recent acquisitions. This resulted in operating profit well ahead of prior year as higher activity levels combined with pricing progress and disciplined cost control offset higher energy and materials costs, as well as labour market constraints.\n\n3\n\n## Construction Accessories\n\nProactive pricing actions by our Construction Accessories business resulted in sales ahead of prior year across all regions, with growth primarily driven by the UK, Germany and North America. Operating profit finished well ahead of prior year as commercial excellence measures successfully mitigated the impact of cost inflation.\n\n## Building Envelope (Discontinued Operations)\n\nThe commentary below refers to the trading results of Building Envelope, prior to its divestment in April 2022 , compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nBuilding Envelope delivered sales growth driven by C.R.

CRH employed its significant expertise in materials technology to work with designers and planners to adapt materials specifications in order to simplify logistics, improve scheduling and lower costs for the customer. This included the provision of off-site manufacturing solutions which helped to minimise the impact of the project on the local community and specialised techniques to facilitate the pouring of high volumes of concrete at heights of over 200 metres in sub-zero temperatures and high winds.\n\nThe solution provided by CRH played a key role in accelerating the construction work and facilitated the completion of this major project ahead of schedule.

Jura Cement's use of alternative fuels include used tyres, plastics, solvent chemical waste, automotive oils, biomass and grains which made up 80% of its overall fuel mix and helped to minimise emissions from fossil fuels in 2022.\n\nIn addition to using recycled waste as a fuel, our businesses also use recycled raw materials. In 2022 our Rudus business, based in Finland, continued to roll out its 'Betoroc' and 'Uuma-betoni' concretes, which use recycled materials including crushed concrete and recycled aggregates.\n\nIn the UK, Tarmac began trials of a new low-carbon concrete on the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project during 2022, reducing CO 2 per cubic metre by approx. 60%. In 2022 Tarmac also successfully trialled hydrogen as a fuel in the production of lime. The combustion of hydrogen produces no CO 2 , emitting just water vapour and is likely to play a key role in the road to net-zero.\n\n## CASE STUDY\n\n<!-- image -->",

Europe Materials generated sales of $10.6 billion and EBITDA (as defined)* of $1.4 billion, 16% and 34% ahead of 2020 respectively with an operating profit of $0.8 billion. Like-for-like sales were 11% ahead of 2020, while EBITDA (as defined)* increased by 22%. Energy market volatility resulted in increased cost inflation but positive pricing actions and a continued focus on cost savings and performance initiatives delivered margin expansion.\n\n## UK & Ireland\n\nUK & Ireland sales were well ahead of 2020 reflecting an improved trading environment following significant COVID-19 disruption in 2020. Operating profit was also significantly ahead due to improved volumes across all product lines but also assisted by cost saving and restructuring initiatives which commenced in 2020. Significant pricing actions were undertaken in the second half of the year to offset input cost inflation, which also contributed to the strong 2021 performance.\n\n## Europe North\n\nDespite prolonged winter weather, demand in Europe North (Finland, Germany and Switzerland) improved as the year progressed. Cement and lime volumes were ahead of 2020 which, combined with strong price increases, resulted in increased sales. Europe North experienced significant energy cost inflation, particularly in the second half, but additional pricing actions and a continued focus on cost saving initiatives resulted in operating profit well ahead of 2020 levels.\n\n## Europe West\n\nEurope West (France, Benelux, Denmark and Spain) delivered a good trading performance with higher cement volumes combined with continued pricing progress across all markets. France in particular experienced a strong recovery as a result of improved underlying trading conditions which, together with significant cost saving actions implemented in 2020, have resulted in like-for-like operating profit well ahead of 2020. Our precast operations also delivered sales and operating profit ahead of 2020 despite experiencing significant raw material and energy cost inflation. Overall, continued cost saving actions and commercial initiatives resulted in operating profit well ahead of 2020.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n## Europe East\n\nEurope East (Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Serbia) experienced mild weather in the fourth quarter and robust demand throughout the year, which resulted in cement volumes ahead of 2020 and continued growth in downstream products. Operating profit in Poland was significantly ahead of 2020 due to good volume and price increases combined with strong cost control. Despite rising energy cost inflation in the second half of the year, overall operating profit was well ahead of 2020 with good cost control and strong price increases across all markets.\n\n## Asia\n\nSales and operating profit in the Philippines were significantly ahead of 2020, which was severely impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Cement volumes were well ahead in 2021 as the market recovered. Despite a competitive pricing environment and rising input costs, operational improvements and cost containment initiatives resulted in operating profit ahead of 2020.\n\nCRH's operations include a 26% stake in Yatai Building Materials in China, where strong price increases offset lower volumes to deliver significantly improved operating profit in 2021.",

Like-for-like sales were 11% ahead reflecting continued strong pricing progress which offset the impact of lower activity levels. In 2022, EBITDA (as defined)* was $1.4 billion, 8% ahead on a like-for-like basis and operating profit was $0.8 billion, 12% ahead like-forlike. Unfavourable currency translation effects resulted in total sales in line with 2021, EBITDA (as defined)* -4% behind 2021, and operating profit 1% ahead.\n\n## UK & Ireland\n\nUK & Ireland sales and operating profit were well ahead of 2021 driven by strong pricing and ongoing performance optimisation initiatives. In the UK, aggregates and asphalt volumes were behind prior year due to lower paving activity, while readymixed concrete volumes benefited from an increase in project activity. Ireland primarily benefited from improved construction activity and pricing progress.\n\n## Europe North\n\nSales in Europe North (Finland, Germany and Switzerland) were in line with 2021 driven mainly by price increases which offset lower volumes, and a strong performance in our lime business. Like-for-like operating profit ended ahead of 2021 as improved pricing and cost savings actions compensated for an inflationary and volatile energy cost environment.\n\n## Europe West\n\nEurope West (France, Benelux, Denmark and Spain) delivered sales slightly below 2021 due to softening volumes. Higher raw materials, energy and freight costs in all countries were offset by higher pricing, which, along with continued cost saving actions and commercial initiatives, saw like-for-like operating profit ahead of 2021.\n\n## Europe East\n\nSales in Europe East (Poland, Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Serbia, and Croatia) were ahead of prior year due to a strong focus on commercial actions to offset significant cost inflation. Poland, in particular, delivered sales and operating profit strongly ahead of 2021. Activity levels in Ukraine were impacted by the ongoing conflict and we continue to prioritise the support of our employees during this challenging time. Total operating profit in Europe East was behind prior year.\n\n## Asia\n\nSales in the Philippines ended the year behind 2021. Construction activity was impacted by a pre-election ban on construction and high cost inflation which slowed large infrastructure project activity. Price increases largely offset weaker volumes; however, operating profit was impacted by high energy and transportation costs which resulted in operating profit significantly below 2021.\n\nCRH's operations include a 26% stake in Yatai Building Materials (reported within the Group's share of equity accounted investments) in China where the government's COVID-19 restrictions impacted many areas of the economy, including the construction sector. This resulted in sales and operating profit below 2021.\n\nGovernance\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures",

Accordingly, the Board and management are committed to building a safe, inclusive and diverse organisation.\n\nDuring 2021, CRH conducted an organisational health survey across its businesses, which highlighted an overall good performance and identi/fied areas for improvement. Action plans in line with these areas were developed and implemented. In the last quarter of 2022, a pulse survey was issued to broadly the same population to ascertain progress on the areas identi/fied for improvement. There was a 76% response rate to the survey, which was very encouraging. All organisational health areas where improvements had been focused showed improvement. In terms of inclusion practices, there was a range of trends. In order to understand the underlying drivers of those trends tailored focus groups of employees will be set up. In addition, as outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 108, an improvement in CRH's Inclusion Assessment, based on an externally validated Enterprise Score from engagement surveys, was included as a metric in our long-term incentive plans.\n\nAlso during 2022, led by members of the SESR Committee, we continued our process of direct employee engagement through an in-person discussion with a cross-section of local employees in Houston, Texas during a Board visit. This was supplemented by separate virtual sessions with employees from across our European and Americas businesses. On behalf of the Board, I would like to take the opportunity to thank those employees who engaged openly with us on their experiences and perspectives of CRH across a broad range of topics, including:\n\n- \u00b7  safety;\n- \u00b7  CRH's culture;\n- \u00b7  awareness of the Code of Business Conduct and the extent to which employees feel empowered to speak-up through the CRH Hotline or otherwise when they have good faith concerns;\n- \u00b7  career progression and personal development;\n- \u00b7  performance transparency in relation to the link between individual roles and the performance of businesses;\n- \u00b7  the integration process for newly-acquired businesses;\n- \u00b7  CRH's employee bene/fit programmes;\n- \u00b7  our newly articulated corporate Purpose; and\n- \u00b7  the bene/fits of collaboration and innovation for employees and CRH\n\nWe also had an opportunity during these engagements to explain our remuneration structures and the alignment of incentives with the Group's strategic priorities. In relation to I&D, we noted that progress and many positive improvements are becoming evident across the organisation along with a common view that this will be a long journey.\n\nThe feedback from both the surveys and our direct engagement with employees has enabled us to conclude that there is a positive alignment\n\nThe primary (premium) listing of CRH plc is on the LSE, with the listing on Euronext Dublin characterised as secondary. For this reason, CRH plc is not subject to the same ongoing listing requirements as would apply to an Irish company with a primary listing on Euronext Dublin.

        "page_content": "between our performance culture, training and career development opportunities, our strong safety culture, our corporate Purpose, the initiatives in place to support I&D and our strategy.\n\nHaving robust talent management processes is a vital component of continued success. In that regard, the Board receives regular updates on talent reviews, which provide us with detailed insights into emerging talent within the organisation, the development programmes in place to support individuals and the plans to close any potential gaps in role succession or capability. We also receive regular reports on progress in relation to identi/fied actions and key metrics in the area of talent management such as gender and diversity pipelines. In addition, during visits to operations in Europe and the US, which in 2022 were to Copenhagen, Denmark and, as noted above, to Houston, Texas, the Board had the opportunity to engage with the Divisional and local management teams, collectively and individually. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to attend management conferences held during the year.\n\nFollowing a suggestion made in the external Board evaluation report, conducted by Christopher Saul Associates in 2021, the outcome of which was reported in the 2021 Annual Report, the remit of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee has been expanded by the Board to include human capital management to the extent that this is not a Board agenda item. In line with this, and to balance more evenly the workload of the Committees, the Board has also decided that responsibility for employee engagement will transfer from the SESR Committee to the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee with effect from January 2023.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the Group's strategy. Each year the Board focuses on a number of key strategic topics for in depth review. In the past year the main areas of focus were on our solutions strategy, innovation and sustainability. Further information on the Group's strategy and business model is included on pages 11 to 59.\n\n## Solutions & Innovation\n\nA primary area of focus for the Board over the past 12 months has been on our accelerating solutions journey in the context of evolving construction trends. This included leveraging the Board site visits in Copenhagen and Houston to gain a detailed understanding of the opportunities and challenges that arise from developing, and expanding upon, the solutions CRH currently provides. The interaction between the execution of our solutions strategy and our work in the area of portfolio management is outlined in the Chief Executive's Review on pages 14 and 15.\n\nIn 2022, the Board considered and approved a $250 million venturing and innovation fund to identify new technologies and business models, and to foster innovation across the organisation. The operational and governance structures to support the fund, which will invest in internal projects and external partnerships, have been put in place and a number of initiatives are underway. The Board receives regular updates on the operation of the fund. Further information on the venturing and innovation fund is contained in the Strategy Report on page 30.\n\nDuring the year, the Board also considered, and approved, an updated organisation structure for the Group, resulting in two distinct Divisions, CRH Americas and CRH Europe. This new structure will support CRH in taking advantage of the opportunities resulting from the changing construction environment while retaining the strengths of the existing model.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nAnother area of signi/ficant focus for the Board in the past year was CRH's decarbonisation roadmap. In particular, our industry leading absolute carbon emissions reduction target by 2030 which is aligned with our ambition to be a net-zero business by 2050. In early 2023, the SBTi validated that our revised targets 1 are in line with the updated 1.5 o C science-based framework which now equate to a 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030 (from a 2021 base year).\n\nFurther details in relation to the Board's oversight of CRH's sustainability initiatives are set out in the SESR Committee Report on pages 104 and 105. In addition, the Directors' Remuneration Report on page 110 sets out the way in which sustainability has been integrated into CRH's incentive plans.\n\n## Business Performance and Capital Expenditure\n\nThe Board has in place robust procedures to monitor business performance, against approved /financial budgets, and in respect of the approval of capital expenditure projects and development activity. Signi/ficant projects and opportunities are brought to the attention of the Board early in the process so that the Board can provide feedback to management prior to a formal proposal being considered. In addition, each year the ADF Committee reports to the Board on a detailed review of acquisitions and capital expenditure after three years of performance following approval of the proposal. Table 2 sets out the limits which apply to projects that can be approved by the Board, the ADF Committee and management respectively.\n\n## Limits for Acquisitions, Divestments and Capital Expenditure Projects\n\nTable 2\n\n| Board    | ADF         | Management/CEO   |\n|----------|-------------|------------------|\n| >\u20ac/$100m | \u20ac/$30-100m* | <\u20ac/$30m          |\n\n*For new regions the limit is \u20ac/$50 million\n\n## Dividends and Share Buybacks\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting CRH's dividend policy and decisions on the level and duration of the Group's share buyback programme. In determining our approach to shareholder distributions, we take into consideration the views of shareholders received through the engagement processes outlined below.\n\n## Stakeholder Engagement\n\nDuring the past 12 months, supported by other Committee Chairs and the Company Secretary as appropriate, I held meetings with shareholders holding c.35% of CRH's issued share capital. These meetings provided a valuable opportunity for me to outline the Board's priorities and perspectives on certain matters and to ascertain shareholders' views on a wide range of topics such as Board composition, succession planning, our strategy, capital allocation policies, our approach to sustainability and remuneration. The feedback from these meetings, which was broadly in line with the Board's priorities and perspectives, was provided to the Board and relevant Committees and factored into the Board's decision-making processes. The Board also regularly receives detailed reports from related engagement activities carried out by management.\n\nAs noted above, the Board has transferred responsibility for employee engagement to the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee from the SESR Committee with effect from January 2023. Given the footprint of CRH, the Board believes that having a Committee responsible for employee engagement is the most effective way of ensuring that the views of employees are understood and are taken into consideration in the Board's decision-making processes. The feedback from employee engagement sessions, the results from organisational health surveys and reports from CRH's Hotline also enable us to assess CRH's culture.\n\nDuring both Board site visits in 2022, the Board had an opportunity to meet with, and hear directly from, customers with whom CRH is working on large scale projects. Customer perspectives on our water, road and urban construction solutions were also represented in our investor update in April 2022.\n\nWe also engage with stakeholder and investor groups in relation to sustainability matters and take their views into account when considering the disclosures to be included in the Annual and Sustainability Reports.",

We also published the CRH Group Tax Strategy, which sets out the tax objectives, strategy and governance framework of the Group, due to the increasing importance for tax transparency across a number of different stakeholders, including Governments, sustainability analysts and investors.\n\nA summary of the full range in which we engage with our stakeholders, including the main areas of interest and outcomes of the various engagement processes in 2022, is set out on pages 44 and 45.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Board has /five permanent committees: the Acquisitions, Divestments & Finance Committee, the Audit Committee, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility Committee. Reports from the Chairs of each of the main Committees are set out on pages 92 to 132.\n\nDetailed reports of all Committee meetings are provided to the Board, while Committee minutes and papers are available to all Board members electronically.\n\nThe terms of reference of each Committee are available on the CRH website, www.crh.com.\n\n## Board Training\n\nThe Board has a programme of regular training in areas such as Compliance & Ethics and the Board's responsibilities in respect of Market Abuse.

Badar and the Board were satis/fied that this would not impact on his time commitment to CRH or create any con/flict of interests.\n\n## Re-election of Directors\n\nTable 7 on page 100 provides a summary of competencies, important to the long-term success of the Group, that each Director seeking re-election at the 2023 AGM brings to the Board. I have evaluated the performance of each Director and am satis/fied that each Director is committed to their role, provides constructive challenge and devotes suf/ficient time and energy to contribute effectively to the performance of the Board. I strongly recommend that shareholders vote in favour of the re-appointment of each Director going forward for re-election at the 2023 AGM.\n\n## Modern Slavery\n\nEach year CRH publishes a Modern Slavery statement on the CRH website, www.crh.com, which sets out the measures CRH and its subsidiaries have taken during the relevant /financial year to ensure that slavery or human traf/ficking is not taking place within CRH's business or its supply chains. Our Legal & Compliance department work with our Procurement and Sustainability teams to update the Statement annually and keep it under review. The outcome of the review is reported to the Board, which approves the statement for publication.\n\n## Dematerialisation of Shares\n\nUnder the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation (EU) 909/2014 (CSDR) there is a requirement for all shares in Irish issuers to be held in book-entry form. The period by which this transition must happen is from 1 January 2023 for new issues of shares and from 1 January 2025 for all remaining shares. Book-entry form means an electronic record of ownership such as an entry in an electronic register, without any further document such as a share certi/ficate.\n\nIn last year's report, I noted that the Irish market was considering fully dispensing with share certi/ficates with effect from 1 January 2023 to avoid potential confusion and complications that might arise in some circumstances by having two systems running in parallel. However, following further consideration, market participants no longer intend to accelerate the transition. Therefore, certi/ficated shareholders will experience no change with respect to their existing shares in 2023 and 2024 and their share certi/ficates will remain valid until 2025.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI hope that this report and the reports from the Board's Committees provide shareholders with a good level of insight into the activities of the Board, the priority areas on which we are focused and the structures in place to enable the Board to ful/fil our governance responsibilities to you.\n\nRichie Boucher\n\nChairman 1 March 2023",

The purpose of this report is to provide shareholders with an insight into the workings of, and principal matters considered by, the Committee in 2022, together with how the Committee has discharged its responsibilities and provided assurance on the integrity of the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Committee are set out in full in its Terms of Reference, which is available on our website, www.crh.com.\n\nThe Committee has an extensive agenda which focuses on monitoring the effectiveness of risk management within the Group as well as ensuring the integrity of the Group's /financial reporting, that any judgements made are appropriate, that the external auditor is effective in its role and that the Group has an effective internal control framework. Table 3 on page 93 provides a high-level summary of the main activities of the Committee in 2022.\n\n## Risk Management & Internal Control\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee continued to monitor and assess the Group's ERM framework and the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties facing the Group, including those that could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. This included discussion with both management and the external auditor, Deloitte, on the impact of climate-related risks on the Group's accounting judgements, disclosures and /financial statements.\n\nWe also considered an assessment of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. This had regard to risk management strategies and all material controls, including /financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the Group's business and concluded that the Group's internal control environment continued to be effective.\n\nIn addition, in the context of ever-evolving cyber security threats, we continued to monitor and discuss with management the Group's IT governance and information security programme and the Group's ability to address and mitigate against evolving cyber security threats.\n\nFurther details on the Group's risk governance and risk assessment processes are included on pages 94 and 95 respectively. Further details on the Group's ERM framework are included on pages 50 to 54.\n\n## Financial Reporting\n\nA key area of responsibility and focus of the Committee each year is to monitor the /financial reporting process and the integrity of the /financial statements, and to review signi/ficant /financial reporting issues and judgements exercised in preparation thereof. Accordingly, during the past year, the Committee spent signi/ficant time reviewing and considering the interim and full year results statements and the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F, together with supporting reports from the Group Finance function highlighting all key estimates, judgements and disclosures made by management. This included consideration and discussion with management and Deloitte of the potential accounting and disclosure implications arising from:\n\n- \u00b7  the current volatile macroeconomic environment;\n- \u00b7  the ongoing con/flict in Ukraine; and\n- \u00b7  engagement with stakeholders and relevant regulators in relation to potential additions to the climate-related disclosures included in the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\nThrough discussions with both management and Deloitte, we also reviewed management's impairment testing methodology and processes, including key judgement areas, assumptions and alignment with our carbon emissions reduction targets, as well as the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements. We found the methodology to be robust and the results of the testing process appropriate. Further details in relation to the impairment testing process for 2022 are outlined in Table 5 on page 97.",

This included the impact on the Group's accounting judgements, disclosures and /financial statements, their alignment with CRH's carbon emissions reduction targets, and its approach with regard to compliance with the recommendations of various regulatory bodies, the TCFD and EU Taxonomy requirements. We received a number of speci/fic climate-related updates from management during 2022 and reviewed the climate-related disclosures, including the TCFD and EU Taxonomy disclosures included within the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F, and agreed that these are appropriate and that the assumptions used in the /financial statements were consistent with these disclosures.\n\nWe also considered and discussed with management and Deloitte various accounting and reporting changes that impacted on the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F and may impact future /financial periods. This included discussion on the implications of the changes to the Group's operating segments, which will be an area of focus for the Committee in 2023 (see page 193 for more details).\n\nIn addition, we reviewed the Going Concern and Viability Statements (see page 136), including the underlying assumptions (including alignment with the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets) and analysis to support the statements. We found the methodology and processes to be robust and recommended to the Board that it approve both statements.\n\n## External Auditor\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nThe Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible for the relationship with the external auditor and for monitoring the effectiveness and quality of the external audit process and the independence of the auditor. The Committee's primary means of assessing the effectiveness of the external audit process is by monitoring performance against the agreed audit plan.\n\nThe Committee also considers the experience and knowledge of the external audit team and the results of post-audit interviews with management and the Audit Committee Chairman. These annual procedures are supplemented by periodic formal reviews of the performance of the external auditor.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\nIn June 2022, we met with Deloitte to agree the 2022 external audit plan. This included robust discussion and challenge with both Deloitte and management on the scope, materiality thresholds and the structure of the 2022 external audit plan.

        "page_content": "## External Auditor - continued\n\nWe met with Deloitte at each Committee meeting during 2022 to monitor progress in relation to the 2022 external audit plan and to discuss and consider their views on various matters, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the appropriateness of the Group's accounting practices and policies;\n- \u00b7 the key estimates, judgements and disclosures made by management; and\n- \u00b7 evolving regulatory requirements and other corporate governance developments\n\nIn February 2023, we received and considered a report from Deloitte on its key audit /findings, including the key risks and signi/ficant areas of judgement, prior to making a recommendation to the Board in relation to the approval of this 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nFurther details in relation to the external auditor, including information on how auditor objectivity and independence are maintained, are included in the Governance Appendix.\n\n## Non-Audit Services\n\nIn order to ensure auditor independence and objectivity, we have adopted a policy which sets out the types of permitted and non-permitted non-audit services and those which require explicit prior approval. In 2022 Deloitte provided a number of audit services, including Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 attestation. Deloitte was also engaged during 2022 on a limited number of non-audit services mainly in relation to potential divestments, as well as to provide help with local tax compliance, advice on taxation laws and other related matters, assignments which typically involve relatively low fees.\n\nThe Committee is satis/fied that the external auditors' knowledge of the Group was an important factor in choosing them to provide these services. The Committee is also satis/fied that the fees paid to Deloitte for non-audit work in 2022, which amounted to $1.6 million and represented c.7% of the total audit fees for the year, did not compromise their independence or objectivity. Details of the amounts paid to the external auditor during the year for audit and other services are set out in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 197 (see also Table 4).\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nIn December 2021, the Committee received and approved the Internal Audit Charter and audit plan for 2022. During the year, we received regular updates from the Head of Internal Audit on the delivery of the 2022 plan and on the principal /findings from the work of Internal Audit and management's responses thereto. External Quality Assessments of Internal Audit are conducted periodically to ensure that the Internal Audit function continues to work ef/ficiently and effectively and in compliance with good practice standards.\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee also considered and approved the proposed Internal Audit strategy for the next /five years, which included detailed consideration of the focus, structure and resources required by the Internal Audit function.\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit has direct access to me as Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Committee meets with the Head of Internal Audit on a regular basis without the presence of management.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI would like to thank my fellow Committee members for their commitment and input to the work of the Committee during 2022.\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, the Committee will continue to focus on the key ongoing areas outlined in Table 3 on page 93, and will also continue to monitor and assess the potential impact of the principal and emerging risks and uncertainties (including climate change) on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nShaun Kelly\n\nChairman of Audit Committee\n\n- 1 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Percentage of Audit and Non-audit Fees   |                      |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| 2021                                     | 99% 9%               |\n| 2022                                     | 91% 7%               |\n| \u25a0 Audit fees                             | \u25a0 Non-audit fees 93% |",

The annual goodwill impairment testing was conducted by management, and papers outlining the methodology and assumptions used in, and the results of, that assessment were presented to the Committee. This included review of key judgement areas and assumptions such as CGU determination, discount rates, growth rates, alignment with the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets and the impact of the ongoing con/flict in Ukraine on our Ukrainian business. Following its deliberations, the Committee was satis/fied that the methodology used by management (which was consistent with prior years) and the results of the assessment, together with the disclosures in note 14, were appropriate.\n\nAs outlined in note 14, no impairment charge was recorded in 2022 (2021: $nil).\n\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers requires revenue and expenses to be recognised on uncompleted contracts, with the underlying principle that, once the outcome of a long-term construction contract can be reliably estimated, revenue and expenses associated with that contract should be recognised by reference to the percentage of completion. If it is anticipated that the contract will be onerous (i.e. its unavoidable cost exceeds the economic bene/fit of the contract), a provision is created.\n\nFollowing discussion with management, recognising that the majority of contracts were completed within one year, the Committee was satis/fied that the recognition of contract revenue (including the associated disclosures) was appropriate for the Group in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Platt\n\nMary K. Rhinehart\n\nSiobh\u00e1n Talbot\n\n## Governance Appendix - Further Information\n\nFurther general information in relation to the following governance-related topics is contained in the Governance Appendix:\n\n- \u00b7  the operation of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee\n- \u00b7  how the Board plans for succession\n- \u00b7 the criteria used to determine the independence of non-executive Directors\n- \u00b7  the tenure of non-executive Directors\n- \u00b7  the responsibilities delegated to the Committee by the Board\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee consists of /five non-executive Directors, considered by the Board to be independent. The biographical details of each member are set out on pages 82 to 84. The Chief Executive normally attends meetings of the Committee.\n\nThis report to shareholders summarises the areas of focus for the Committee over the course of the last year, which were primarily: Board composition and renewal, including diversity; Board Committee composition and responsibilities; and executive Director succession planning.\n\n## Board Composition, Renewal and Diversity\n\nThe Board currently comprises two executive Directors and 10 non-executive Directors. Following considerable refreshment over the past number of years, four non-executive Directors have been appointed in the last three years, while six have between three and six years' experience on the Board.\n\nAs can be seen from the biographies of each Director on pages 82 to 84 and the Tables outlining the Board's composition and competencies on pages 85 and 100, your Board is diverse in terms of skills and experience, age, gender and ethnicity. We consider the current size and composition of the Board to be within a range which is appropriate. The spread of nationalities of the Directors re/flects the geographical reach of the Group and we consider that the Board as a whole has the appropriate blend of skills, knowledge and experience, from a wide range of industries, regions and backgrounds, necessary to lead the Group.\n\nA primary area of focus for Board renewal over the last year has been on identifying potential candidates who would further enhance the Board's experience in capital intensive industries of a scale and scope similar to CRH, and in meeting the challenges of, and unlocking the value from, the transition to a low-carbon environment, while also enhancing diversity on the Board.\n\nGender diversity on the Board, which has recently fallen below the year end levels of 2019 and 2020 when more than 40% of the Board was composed of women, continues to be a core criterion when providing role speci/fications to external agents engaged to identify candidates for consideration by the Committee. The Board's policy on diversity in respect of director appointments is set out on page 99. Details of Board gender and ethnicity are set out on page 85.\n\nThe Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee and the SESR Committee work collectively with management on the I&D agenda at below Board level across CRH and monitor progress against agreed Group objectives and targets such as the Board's target of having a minimum of 33% of senior leaders being women by 2030. Details of the current gender balance across the Group, including of the senior leadership team and their direct reports, is set out on page 1.\n\n## Board Committee Composition and Responsibilities\n\nThe Board appointed Mary Rhinehart as Chairman of the SESR Committee during the year. Mary's report on the operation of the SESR Committee is set out on pages 104 and 105. Other changes to committee composition during the year are set out in Table 6 on page 99.\n\nAs outlined in the introduction to the Corporate Governance Report, the Board has extended the remit of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee to include oversight of CRH's human capital management. In addition, responsibility for employee engagement has been transferred to the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee from the SESR Committee with effect from January 2023.",

McKay  |                                            | Audit     |\n\n## Chairman\n\nIn advance of the completion of my initial three-year term as Chairman at the 2023 AGM, the Senior Independent Director engaged with my colleagues on the Board, individually and collectively, to ascertain whether the Board wished me to continue in the role. The Senior Independent Director also chaired this Committee when it considered this issue. I am delighted to have been invited to serve for a further three years and have accepted, subject, of course, to my continued annual re-election to the Board by shareholders.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nDuring the year, following a recommendation from the Committee, the Board appointed Lamar McKay as Senior Independent Director in place of Gillian Platt who had held the position since 2018. The responsibilities of the Senior Independent Director are set out in the Governance Appendix.\n\n## Executive Director Succession Planning\n\nA priority of the Board and the Committee over the past number of years has been enhancing our long-term succession planning for the executive Directors and this is typically an agenda item at each meeting of the Committee and most Board meetings.\n\nWhilst our Chief Executive, Albert Manifold, has a contract of employment currently until age 62 and no decisions have been taken in relation to the timing of succession for this role or potential candidates, the Committee has continued to support the Board in relation to the long-term process of planning for Chief Executive succession. Working in the context of a number of planning scenarios, development programmes for potential internal candidates, which are supported by Egon Zehnder 1 , are in place and external candidate pools are regularly reviewed. Emergency arrangements are also in place for unexpected events.\n\n## Internal Board Evaluation\n\nThe Senior Independent Director undertook an internal Board performance evaluation, which built upon the /findings of the externally facilitated evaluation conducted in 2021. The process, which included consideration of Board dynamics, composition and diversity, the relationship between management and the Board and areas of focus from a non-executive Director perspective, involved a series of one to one meetings, with a report of the feedback being considered by the Board. A number of suggestions were included in the report, including in relation to board composition priorities, strategic topics for in depth review, succession planning, agenda structures and meeting pre-read materials.\n\n## Corporate Governance\n\nThe Committee is responsible for reviewing the independence of Board members and has recommended to the Board that all of the non-executive Directors be deemed to be independent. The Committee also monitors developments in best practice in relation to corporate governance and makes recommendations to the Board in relation to changes and enhancements to current procedures, where appropriate.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n## Policy on Board Diversity\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that the Board is suf/ficiently diverse and appropriately balanced. In its work in the area of Board renewal and succession planning, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee looks at the following four criteria when considering Director roles:\n\n- \u00b7  International business experience, particularly in the regions in which the Group operates or into which it intends to expand;\n- \u00b7  Skills, knowledge and expertise (including education or professional background) in areas relevant to the operation of the Board;\n- \u00b7  Diversity in all aspects, including nationality, gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths; and\n- \u00b7  The need for an appropriately sized Board\n\nDuring the ongoing process of Board renewal, each, or a combination, of these factors can take priority. To date, the Board has not set any policy regarding age. The ages of the Directors range from 51 to 69, which the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee believes is appropriate at the current time.\n\n## Non-executive Director Appointment Process\n\n- \u00b7  Non-executive Director recruitment processes are supported by an external recruitment agent\n- \u00b7  A skills matrix is maintained to identify particular skills that would enhance the Board or which might need to be replaced following planned Board retirements\n- \u00b7  Potential candidate lists are collated based on speci/fications agreed following input from the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee\n- \u00b7  The Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee reviews candidate lists and selects individuals for interview\n- \u00b7  Once a preferred candidate is identi/fied other members of the Board are invited to meet with them prior to formal consideration of their appointment to the Board\n\n## Pre-emption Rights\n\nThe Pre-emption Group in the UK published a revised statement of principles on the disapplication of pre-emption rights in November 2022, which increased the guideline threshold for annual pre-emption rights authorities from 10% to 20% of the issued share capital, with some additional /flexibility for follow up offers of up to a maximum of an additional 4% in certain circumstances. Having considered the matter, the Committee recommended to the Board that it seek a pre-emption authority of up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital at the 2023 AGM, which is in line with the authorities received in prior years. The Committee will keep under review evolving best practice and shareholders' perspectives in this area. Further details on the authorities to be sought at the 2023 AGM are set out in the Directors' Report on page 137.\n\nRichie Boucher Chairman of the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee 1 March 2023",

The major shareholders do not have any special voting rights. Details of the substantial holdings as at 31 December 2022 are provided in Table 9.\n\n## Stock Exchange Listings\n\nCRH, which is incorporated in Ireland and subject to Irish company law, has a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin (formerly the Irish Stock Exchange) and its American Depositary Shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\n## Legal and Compliance\n\nCRH's Legal and Compliance function supports the Group in operating consistently with its values, providing advice and guidance to executive and operational management and working closely with them on a range of matters including establishing policies and procedures, providing compliance training and communications, providing legal advice on compliance and business issues, monitoring and investigating Hotline calls, competition/antitrust law, and ensuring the Group is informed of any changes to regulation and/or reporting requirements. CRH's Legal and Compliance structure comprises experienced and quali/fied professionals. Operating companies exercise local Legal and Compliance oversight, and management ensures adequate resources are in place.\n\n## Code of Business Conduct\n\nOur culture as a company is built on our commitment to uphold the CRH Values. At CRH, our values unite us in the way we work, every day, all over the world. They are the foundation of our culture - they show what's important to us and are central to our success as a company.\n\nAt CRH, we do the right things in the right way, with respect for one another and for the law. This has always been our approach and as we continually reshape and improve our business, the one thing that will never change is our character - that combination of integrity, honesty and dependability that is a real strength of CRH.\n\nThe foundation of the Legal and Compliance programme is the Code of Business Conduct (CoBC) and supporting policies, which set out our standards of legal, honest and ethical behaviour. The CoBC complies with the applicable code of ethics regulations of the SEC arising from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The CoBC is applicable to all employees of the CRH Group, including the Chief Executive, our Global Leadership Team and senior /financial of/ficers. A refreshed CoBC and an enhanced training module was launched during 2021 and in 2022 both the CoBC and the training module were further updated to re/flect the Group's refreshed values.\n\nCRH's Internal Audit function works side-by-side with Legal and Compliance in monitoring compliance with the CoBC and supporting policies, and in providing an integrated approach to assurance. This cross-functional collaboration supports CRH's goal: to ensure CRH leads with integrity.\n\n## Awareness and Training\n\nIn line with our commitment to maintain high ethical business conduct standards, we continue to update and improve awareness and training efforts on an ongoing basis. All new employees are provided with the CoBC and relevant employees undertake CoBC training and Advanced Compliance Training on a regular basis. Additional training modules are developed for more focused topics and audiences where necessary.\n\n## CRH Hotline\n\nIn 2022, CRH launched a Speak Up Policy which is available on www.crh.com in 22 languages. To provide guidance to reporters on our Speak Up channels and processes, Speak Up FAQs are also available to all employees in 22 languages. CRH engages an external service provider to administer an independent 24/7 multi-lingual con/fidential 'Hotline' facility that allows reporters to make an anonymous report, if they wish. CRH is committed to supporting all persons, including current and potential employees, customers, independent contractors, suppliers and/or other external stakeholders to raise good faith concerns that may be relevant to the CoBC, inappropriate or illegal behaviour or violations of any CRH policies or local laws. Our Speak Up Policy outlines CRH's commitment to providing various ways to speak up, handling those reports appropriately and con/fidentially and treating all reporters with fairness and respect to ensure they are comfortable when speaking up. All concerns are handled discreetly and are professionally investigated with appropriate actions taken based on investigation /findings. CRH is committed to creating an atmosphere where employees feel empowered and feel comfortable to speak up when they have good faith concerns. The Policy also af/firms our zero-tolerance approach to retaliation or any form of penalisation for Speaking Up.\n\n## Communications with Shareholders\n\nCommunications with shareholders are given high priority and the Group devotes considerable time and resources each year to shareholder engagement. We recognise the importance of effective dialogue as an integral element of good corporate governance. The Investor Relations team, together with the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Of/ficer and other senior executives, regularly meet with institutional shareholders (each year covering over 60% of the shareholder base). Detailed reports on the issues covered in those meetings and the views of shareholders are circulated to the Board after each group of meetings.

Platt\n\n## Governance Appendix - Further Information\n\nFurther general information in relation to the following topics is contained in the Governance Appendix:\n\n- \u00b7  the operation of the Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility Committee\n- \u00b7  the responsibilities delegated to the Committee by the Board\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe SESR Committee currently consists of nine Directors, including the Chief Executive. The biographical details of each Committee member are set out on pages 82 to 84. The Chief Operating Of/ficer, whose remit includes responsibility for sustainability, typically attends meetings. Other executives attend as required.\n\nDuring the past 12 months, the Committee received updates at each meeting on topics such as Safety, Purpose, I&D and employee engagement, monitored progress against the Group's ambitious 2030 sustainability targets and, together with the Board, considered CRH's decarbonisation roadmap in depth. The Committee also received reports on environmental, health & safety and social reviews, climate lobbying practices, hotline reports on issues that fall within the Committee's remit, the roll-out of the refreshed Code of Business Conduct and related training, and developments in relation to external reporting requirements.\n\n## Safety\n\nHealth, safety and well-being, and managing health and safety risks within our businesses, is our top priority in terms of our employees, contractors and customers. We are committed to going beyond industry-minimum requirements to create an empowering safety culture. Our ambition is to have a culture of safety and wellness working towards zero harm, with a target of zero fatalities in any year.\n\nAs the Chairman mentioned in the introduction to the Annual Report, there were /five reportable fatalities in 2022 involving one employee and four contractors. The Board received detailed reports on the background circumstances of these incidents. The Committee also received follow-up reports on the investigations into the root causes in each case. We are satis/fied that none of the incidents were attributable to a lack of applicable training, de/ficient safety procedures or defective equipment being used. Furthermore, through detailed analysis and discussion of a range of measures, as well as through engagement with employees, we are satis/fied that the appropriate safety culture is in place across the Group and that employees are, for example, comfortable to stop a work process if they believe unsafe practices are being employed. Nevertheless, management considers on an ongoing basis whether learnings or enhancements are possible, particularly in challenging areas such as road logistics and specialist contractors working from heights. The Committee advised the Remuneration Committee that it did not consider that there were any issues arising from its safety reviews that would require an override of remuneration incentive outcomes in 2022.\n\nWe also receive regular reports in relation to trends in leading and lagging safety indicators. Leading indicators relate to reporting of serious safety incidents, safety audits and safety culture assessments. In addition, learnings from serious injury and fatal incidents are shared across the Group as soon as possible.\n\n## Purpose\n\nGood progress has been made in sharing our newly articulated Purpose to all employees following its launch in 2022, and we will monitor the plans to embed our Purpose into all company processes. Further details in relation to CRH's Purpose are set out on pages 6 and 7.\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\nThe Committee monitors the implementation of CRH's I&D strategy, including the roll-out of related initiatives such as the content of, and feedback from, a programme put in place for senior leaders across the organisation to provide them with tools to meet common I&D challenges, and the progress being made in relation to our 2030 targets.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nAs mentioned earlier in the Corporate Governance section, with effect from January 2023, the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee has assumed responsibility for employee engagement. An update on employee engagement during 2022 is set out on page 88.",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\nBusiness Performance & Segmental Reviews\n\n## Climate Change and Sustainability\n\nAs reported last year, our 2030 absolute carbon emissions reduction target was put in place as part of our ambition to be a net-zero business by 2050 in accordance with the Paris Agreement. In early 2023, the SBTi validated that our revised targets 1 are in line with the updated 1.5 o C science-based framework which now equate to a 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030 (on a 2021 base year). It will take some time for the many initiatives in areas such as low-carbon products, business optimisation, low-carbon fuels, transport and mobile equipment, clean electricity, new technologies etc. to take effect. To support delivery of our 2030 roadmap, we expect to invest approximately $150 million per annum in incremental capital expenditure. In addition, we have put in place a $250 million venturing and innovation fund referred to on page 30. This work is supported by our target for our cement plants to reduce cement speci/fic net CO 2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product to 520kg by 2025 (accelerated from 2030). For more information on our decarbonisation journey, please see pages 26 to 31.\n\nAs a large scale landholder, we have a responsibility to continue to preserve and protect biodiversity. A core part of our Environmental Policy is to 'Support and enhance biodiversity, ensuring responsible land use and biodiversity management'. CRH operates at approximately 1,200 quarries/pits covering c.130,000 hectares and has a responsibility to enhance and restore natural habitats while mitigating potential negative impacts. CRH adheres to all relevant biodiversity legislation at each operating location and engages in collaborative initiatives to enhance biodiversity. During the year we received and considered updates on progress in relation to the achievement of our 2030 target and the work in developing CRH's biodiversity framework. For more information on our biodiversity policies and targets, please see pages 36 and 37.\n\nIn order to play our part in driving positive change, CRH works with regulators to establish improved legislative frameworks and industry standards for a net-zero built environment and the Committee receives regular updates on our climate lobbying practices.\n\nDuring the course of the next year, we will continue to focus on CRH's initiatives and achievement against our 2030 sustainability targets.\n\n## Incorporating ESG Metrics in CRH's Remuneration Incentive Structures\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has incorporated sustainability and I&D metrics into CRH's incentive structures. Further details are set out on page 110.\n\n## Regulatory Environment\n\nIn 2021, CRH introduced new and enhanced disclosures in relation to both the TCFD and the EU Taxonomy Regulations. The TCFD framework requires disclosure on climate-related governance, strategy, risk management, as well as metrics and targets. CRH previously used the TCFD framework on a voluntary basis, and in line with our commitment to transparency, our disclosures are now consistent with TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures. EU Taxonomy, which is an EU regulatory classi/fication system that de/fines environmentally sustainable activities by providing 'technical screening criteria' thresholds for activities to be reported as 'sustainable', requires CRH to disclose the percentage of activities that are taxonomy-eligible. TCFD and EU Taxonomy related disclosures in respect of 2022 have been further enhanced and are set out on pages 56 to 59 and 270 to 273 respectively.\n\n## Mary K. Rhinehart\n\nChairman of the Safety, Environment & Social Responsibility Committee 1 March 2023\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n## Examples of Best Practice Initiatives\n\n## Safety\n\n## Automatic Fire Protection System for Mobile Equipment\n\n## Summary\n\n- \u00b7  We are committed to implementing the systems and processes necessary to create a culture of safety excellence\n- \u00b7  For example, Romcim, part of our Europe Materials Division in Romania, implemented an automatic /fire protection system for mobile equipment at their Hoghiz location\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u00b7  The detection and suppression system prevents injuries and damages that could arise from potentially hard to detect and intense engine /fires. Preventative action like this will reduce risks for employees at the Hoghiz plant and help to ensure they are able to complete their work safely\n\n## Inclusion & Diversity\n\n## Inclusive Leadership Development Programme\n\n## Summary\n\n- \u00b7  More than 250 senior leaders (including the Global Leadership Team) across CRH participated in the programme\n- \u00b7  It took place virtually over six months and was made up of three modules and three peer coaching sessions totalling 14 hours\n- \u00b7  The programme aimed to create lasting and sustainable change, developing inclusive leadership skills and habits\n- \u00b7  Participants also came away with a toolkit of nine practical tools that can be applied in day-to-day interactions and processes\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u00b7  Signi/ficant investment of leader's time, helping to develop their capability to build and lead a more inclusive organisation\n\n## Contributing to a more Circular Economy\n\n## Innovative Products & Solutions\n\n## Summary\n\n- \u00b7  Our ambition is to deliver innovative products and solutions to drive progress towards a circular, net-zero built environment\n- \u00b7  CRH's structural concrete business in Belgium, part of our Europe Materials Division, is collaborating with a Belgian start-up to establish a project involving the reuse of building insulation products\n- \u00b7  As part of this collaboration, CRH's structural concrete business in Belgium is supplying recycled materials which are then converted into innovative insulation products\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u00b7  By continuously investing in sustainable solutions, we are driving toward our goal of 50% revenue coming from products with enhanced sustainability attributes by 2025 and contributing to a more circular economy",

        "page_content": "## TCFD - Sustainability Governance\n\n## Board Oversight\n\nSustainability, including addressing the impact of climate change, is embedded in the Group's strategy and business model. The Board recognises the importance of decarbonisation in addressing the challenges of climate change and believes that the Group's integrated strategy of value-added products and innovative solutions have a key role to play in delivering a more resilient and sustainable built environment.\n\nClimate change and sustainability are frequent discussion topics at Board and Board Committee meetings, with the Board and its Committees discussing various aspects of the Group's climate strategy, the linkage between the Group's remuneration policies and practices and the Group's sustainability (and climate-related) objectives, stakeholder expectations, the regulatory environment and CRH's carbon emissions reduction targets at the majority of meetings during 2022. In addition, climate change and sustainability-related matters form an integral part of discussions on the Group's strategy and business model, capital allocation and risk management. The SESR Committee, to which the Board has delegated primary responsibility for monitoring developments related to sustainability, including climate, and providing strategic direction, oversight and support to the Board on these important topics, meets every quarter. The Board monitors and oversees progress against climate-related targets and goals through detailed reports of discussions and recommendations which are presented to it by the SESR Committee following the conclusion of each meeting.\n\n## Management Responsibility\n\nThe Chief Executive is responsible for the operational and pro/fit performance of the Group and is accountable to the Board for all authority delegated to executive management. The Chief Executive executes strategy agreed with the Board and regularly reports to the Board on the progress and performance of the Group, including in relation to climate-related matters.\n\nThe Chief Executive is supported by the Global Leadership Team, which is responsible for implementing strategy, pursuing performance delivery and progressing the Group's sustainability and climate-related agenda.\n\nResponsibility for formulating and executing our climate strategy sits with the Chief Operating Of/ficer. The Global Leadership Team receives support from various executive-level committees and other working groups and functions on sustainability and climate-related issues.\n\nFor more information on the Group's organisation structure, including how responsibilities feed through each level, please see our Risk Governance Framework on page 94.\n\nTable 13 provides a high-level summary of the Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities during 2022. Further information is also included in the Governance Report on page 89 and in the SESR Committee Report on page 105.

Platt\n\nMary K. Rhinehart\n\n## Governance Appendix - Further Information\n\nFurther general information in relation to the following topics is contained in the Governance Appendix:\n\n- \u00b7  the operation of the Remuneration Committee\n- \u00b7 the responsibilities delegated to the Committee by the Board\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am delighted to introduce, on behalf of my colleagues on the Remuneration Committee and on the Board, the Remuneration Report to shareholders, which is split into three sections: this introductory overview, a summary of the remuneration policy updated and approved by shareholders in 2022, and the Annual Report on Remuneration, which contains details of CRH's remuneration arrangements and includes various legislative, regulatory and best practice disclosures.\n\n## Context and Performance in 2022\n\nDespite a challenging and volatile cost environment in both North America and Europe, CRH delivered another strong result in 2022, with increased sales, pro/fits and margins driven by the continued execution of our integrated and sustainable solutions strategy. The dividend for 2022 was increased by 5% and we continued our buyback programme returning $1.2 billion to shareholders, which brings the total returned to shareholders through the share buyback programme to over $4.1 billion. The Group's disciplined approach to capital allocation provides further opportunities for value creation.\n\n## Remuneration Policy\n\nI would like to thank shareholders for their strong support of CRH's updated remuneration policy at the 2022 AGM. The updated policy provided for the enhancement of our long-term incentive scorecard by incorporating important metrics related to sustainability and our people, while retaining the broad structure of the previous policies which have served the Company well. A summary of the updated policy is set out on pages 113 to 118.\n\nWe believe that our remuneration structures are fully aligned with and support CRH's strategic priorities, our Purpose to reinvent the way that the world is built and our core values that people are our priority, character is our strength, performance is our commitment and innovation is our way forward. The alignment with strategy is summarised in Table 17 on page 110. Further details on our Purpose and our values are contained on pages 6 and 7.\n\n## Executive Directors' Remuneration\n\n## Base Salary\n\nAs reported in last year's Remuneration Report, the Committee approved salary increases of 2.75% for the executive Directors in respect of 2022. This was in line with the increases for the wider workforce in Ireland and the UK. Increases in salary for employees across the Group in 2023 will depend on a range of factors speci/fic to a region or business. In Ireland increases will generally be 4.25%, while increases in the UK will be c.4.5%. For the executive Directors, salary increases have been set at a lower level of 3.5%.\n\n## Pension Entitlements\n\nIn line with the planned phased reduction, the contractual pension entitlements of our Chief Executive, Albert Manifold, ceased in full in August 2022 when he reached aged 60. As previously advised, the Chief Financial Of/ficer's pension contribution is aligned with the rate which is available to the wider workforce in Ireland and the UK.\n\n## 2022 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nRe/flecting the strong performance in 2022, the /financial metrics for the annual bonus plan, which accounted for 80% of the overall opportunity were achieved in full. The Committee also assessed the performance of the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Of/ficer against their personal and strategic objectives (which represent 20% of the overall opportunity), which the Committee concluded were met to the fullest extent possible. However, notwithstanding the outperformance during the year, in the context of the uncertain economic climate and backdrop of high in/flation and rising costs, both management and the Committee judged that it would be appropriate to cap the bonus outcome at 85% of maximum.",

In reaching that conclusion, the SESR Committee was satis/fied that none of the reportable fatalities was attributable to a lack of applicable training, de/ficient safety procedures or defective equipment being used. Furthermore, through detailed analysis and discussion of a range of measures, as well as through engagement with employees, the SESR Committee was satis/fied that the appropriate safety culture is in place across the Group. Following discussion, the Committee concurred with the SESR Committee and concluded that downward discretion on these 2022 bonus outcomes should not be applied. Further details in relation to achievements against the /financial and personal/strategic targets are set out on page 120.\n\n## 2020 Performance Share Plan Award\n\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP) Awards are made to c.750 executives across the organisation. The PSP Award made in 2020 has been assessed against the cash/flow, RONA and TSR targets set by the Committee in February 2020. Performance against these targets, which were set before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and were not subsequently adjusted, has resulted in a 100% vesting level. The reference price used for the award level (\u20ac33.10) was set in early March 2020, before the onset of the pandemic resulted in a signi/ficant impact on equity markets generally and CRH's share price for a time. Taking into account the very strong performance of the Company over the three years of the award, with sustained increases in sales, pro/fits and margins, increased dividends and the continuation of the share buyback programme, the Committee is satis/fied that the 100% vesting of the award is appropriate and that the increase in share price over the period is due to the Company's underlying performance rather than a 'windfall' gain resulting from market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## 2023 Incentive Plan Targets\n\nThe targets for the 2023 Bonus Plan will continue to be based on /financial targets of EPS, cash/flow and RONA, representing 80% of the opportunity, with the remaining 20% relating to personal and strategic objectives. The 2023 targets and the performance against those targets will be disclosed in the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\nThe targets for the 2023 PSP award are set out in Table 35 on page 126. In line with the policy approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM and the 2022 PSP award, the metrics are a mix of /financial targets (Cash/flow, RONA and TSR) (being 85% of the award) and non-/financial targets (15%) which are focused on decarbonisation, sustainability and I&D.\n\nIn setting the targets for the annual bonus plan and PSP awards in 2023, the Committee has made a number of assumptions in relation to the macro-economic environment. In keeping with prior practice, these assumptions will be kept under review and, if appropriate, the Committee may adjust the targets or exercise its discretion at the time of vesting to ensure pay outcomes remain aligned with performance, particularly if the targets become less stretching than intended when they were set.\n\n## Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\nFee increases of 3.5% will apply for 2023 for the Chairman and non-executive Directors.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nAs outlined in the Chairman's introduction to the Corporate Governance section on page 88, the Board led by members of the SESR Committee engaged with a cross section of employees during the past 12 months through a mixture of in-person and video conference calls. These were interactive sessions, which provided an opportunity for employees to discuss with Board members a wide range of topics and for us to gain a direct insight in relation to their perspectives on CRH. In relation to remuneration, we received comments on the positive nature in which local employee bene/fit programmes were valued and appreciated, particularly in the case of the employees of newly acquired companies. We also had an opportunity to explain CRH's overall remuneration structures, including the components of executive Director remuneration, and importantly how they linked to the metrics by which CRH as a whole is managed and the key strategic targets set by the Board.\n\nOverall, the feedback we received was that there was an understanding of CRH's executive remuneration structures and the link with long-term organisational priorities, and that including incentives for non-/financial performance was a positive step to help ensure the long-term future of CRH.\n\n## Gender Pay Gap Reporting\n\nIn the UK, our subsidiaries have reported on gender pay for a number of years. In Ireland, this requirement was implemented for the /first time in 2022. Three subsidiaries, with a combined total of 1,319 employees, have published reports under the new legislation. The mean gender pay gap across the three Irish CRH companies is 12%, while the median pay gap is 15% (the latter in favour of women). A number of initiatives have been implemented to seek to address the gap identi/fied.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n2022 was another year of very strong performance for the Group in challenging circumstances. The Committee believes that the way in which we have implemented the remuneration policy outlined in this report is appropriate taking into account a range of factors, including the strong performance in 2022, the continued value created for shareholders and the experience of wider stakeholders. As usual, this Remuneration Report will be included on the agenda of the 2023 AGM. We look forward to receiving your support for the Report.\n\nLamar McKay Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 1 March 2023\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures",

The Board and the Committee are regularly updated on the perspectives of our employees and take these perspectives into account when making remuneration decisions. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has oversight of remuneration policy across the Group and endeavours to keep the structure of remuneration consistent as far as possible, given CRH's international footprint. Generally speaking, total remuneration is more variable (and, in particular, weighted towards long-term performance) for roles with greater levels of responsibility and scope. Further details in relation to workforce engagement on remuneration matters are set out on page 109.\n\nIn setting the remuneration policy and practices for executive Directors, the Committee also takes into consideration the six pillars outlined in the 2018 Code: clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture, and is satis/fied that the 2022 Policy addresses each of these areas (see page 113 for further details).\n\nTable 18\n\n| Most Recent Remuneration Related Votes          |   Year of AGM | % in Favour   | % Against   | No. of   Votes Withheld   | Total No. of Votes Cast   (incl.

This allowance was similar in value to the reduction in the Company's liability represented by the pension bene/fit foregone. It was calculated based on actuarial advice as the equivalent of the reduction in the Company's liability to Mr. Manifold and spread over the term to retirement as annual compensation allowances. The planned phased reduction of Mr. Manifold's allowance, details of which were outlined in the 2019 Directors' Remuneration Report, was continued in 2022, with his payment being reduced to 25% of salary as at 1 January 2022. The compensation allowance for Mr. Manifold reduced to zero in August 2022. Mr. Mintern receives a supplementary taxable non-pensionable cash supplement equivalent to 10% of his annual base salary in lieu of a pension contribution.\n- (v)   Annual Bonus Plan: Under the executive Directors' Annual Bonus Plan for 2022, a bonus was payable for meeting clearly de/fined and stretch targets and strategic goals. The structure of the 2022 Plan, together with details of the performance against targets and payouts in respect of 2022, are set out on pages 119 and 120. A third of the 2022 bonuses to be paid to executive Directors will be deferred into shares for a period of three years, with no additional performance conditions. In the case of Mr. Mintern, the 2021 bonus disclosed in the above Table re/flects the portion attributable to his tenure as an executive Director.\n- (vi)   In February 2023, the Remuneration Committee determined that 100% of the maximum PSP awards made in 2020 will vest, based on performance. The award for Mr. Manifold is subject to a further two-year holding period and will vest in 2025. The award for Mr. Mintern, which was granted prior to his appointment to the Board, is not subject to an additional holding period and will vest in April 2023. For the purposes of this table, the value of these has been estimated using a share price of \u20ac36.44, being the three-month average share price to 31 December 2022. Amounts in the long-term incentive column for 2021 re/flect the value of long-term incentive awards with a performance period ending in 2021 (i.e. the PSP awards granted in 2019), which the Remuneration Committee determined in February 2022 had met the applicable performance targets. The award for Mr. Manifold is scheduled to vest in 2024 following the completion of a two-year holding period. The award for Mr. Mintern, which was granted prior to his appointment to the Board, vested in April 2022 (the value of the award on vesting was \u20ac1,422,028). For the purposes of this table, the value of these awards has been estimated using a share price of \u20ac43.11, being the three-month average share price to 31 December 2021. Amounts in the long-term incentive column for 2020 re/flect the value of long-term incentive awards with a performance period ending in 2020 (i.e. the PSP awards granted in 2018), which the Remuneration Committee determined in February 2021 had met the applicable performance targets. The award is scheduled to vest in 2023 following the completion of a two-year holding period. For the purposes of this table, the value of these awards has been estimated using a share price of \u20ac33.01, being the three-month average share price to 31 December 2020.",

As the Company is not seeking shareholder approval for any revision of the Policy in 2023, the full text of the Policy has not been reproduced in this report. The following paragraphs and Tables 21 to 25 on pages 114 to 118 provide a summary of key elements of the Policy. The Policy is consistent with that shown last year, save the changes to the performance scenario charts.\n\nThe Group's remuneration structures are designed to drive performance and link reward to the responsibilities and individual contribution of executives, while at the same time re/flecting the risk policies of the Group. It is our policy to grant participation in the Group's performance-related plans to key management to encourage alignment with shareholders' interests and to create a community of common interest among different regions and nationalities.\n\nIn setting remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the remuneration practices of other international companies of similar size and scope and trends in executive remuneration generally, in each of the regions in which the Company operates.\n\nThe Committee is mindful of managing any con/flicts of interest. Therefore, no individual is involved in determining his/her own remuneration arrangements. The Committee determines the remuneration of the Chairman and the executive Directors, with neither the Chairman nor any executive Director being present when their respective individual remuneration is being considered or approved. The remuneration of the non-executive Directors, including the Committee members, is determined by a committee of the Chairman and the executive Directors.\n\n## Regulatory Backdrop\n\nUnder the Shareholder Rights Directive 2017/2018 which was transposed into Irish law by the EU (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2020 (\"SRD II\"), public limited companies must submit a remuneration policy to an advisory vote at least every four years or earlier if there is a proposed material change to the approved policy. In order to continue alignment with general practice in the UK, the Committee intends to seek approval from shareholders to renew/update the policy every three years.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n## CRH's Approach to Remuneration\n\nThe purpose of the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy is to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReward and motivate executives to perform in the long-term interests of the shareholders\n\nAttract and retain executives of the highest calibre\n\nFoster entrepreneurship within the Group by rewarding the creation of shareholder value through organic and acquisitive growth\n\nProvide an appropriate blend of fixed and variable remuneration and short and long-term incentives\n\nReflect the spread of the Group's operations so that remuneration packages in each geography are appropriate and competitive for that area\n\nRe/flect the risk policies and appetite of the Group\n\nIn formulating the 2022 Policy, the Committee sought to ensure that it and the Group's remuneration practices were consistent with the six factors set out in Provision 40 of the 2018 Code:\n\n## Clarity\n\nThe 2022 Policy is designed to be sustainable and simple.\n\n## Simplicity\n\nThe 2022 Policy utilises market standard annual bonus and long-term incentive plans, the operation of both of which are clearly explained in detail and well-understood by participants.\n\n## Risk\n\nThe 2022 Policy has been designed to ensure that inappropriate risk taking is discouraged with a balanced use of annual and longer term incentives; best practice measures such as signi/ficant in-employment and post-employment shareholding requirements to align the long-term interests of executives and shareholders; and the use of clawback and malus provisions. In addition, the Committee retains discretion to override formulaic outcomes; any use of such discretion will be disclosed in the relevant Remuneration Report.\n\n## Predictability\n\nThe possible outcomes under the 2022 Policy are quanti/fiable. Illustrations of potential outcomes under various scenarios are included in this report.\n\n## Proportionality\n\nThe 2022 Policy has been designed to ensure that there is a clear link between pay outcomes and the delivery of the Group's strategy and performance. A signi/ficant proportion of the executive Directors' potential remuneration is 'at risk' and is subject to clearly de/fined and stretching performance targets.\n\n## Alignment to Culture\n\nThe 2022 Policy is designed to promote the long-term sustainable success of the Group. The performance metrics and targets used in the annual and long-term incentive plans re/flect our values and key strategic priorities.",

the individual's skills, experience and performance; -  salary levels at FTSE listed companies of a similar size and complexity  to CRH and other international construction and building materials  companies; and -  pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group \u00b7  Base salary is normally reviewed annually with changes generally  effective on 1 January, although the Committee may make an out-of- cycle increase if it considers it to be appropriate                                                                           | \u00b7  Irish-based executive Directors may participate in a contributory de/fined  bene/fit scheme or, if they joined the Group after 1 January 2012, in a de/fined  contribution scheme as the de/fined bene/fit scheme which the Directors  participate in is closed to new entrants \u00b7  For new appointments to the Board the Committee may determine that  alternative pension provisions will operate (for example a cash contribution).  When determining pension arrangements for new appointments the Committee  will give regard to existing entitlements, the cost of the arrangements, market  practice and the pension arrangements received elsewhere in the Group.  Pension contribution rates for any newly appointed executive Directors will  not exceed the norm for pension related contributions/allowances for new  recruits, across the general workforce, in the individual's home jurisdiction                          |\n| Maximum  opportunity           | \u00b7  Base salaries are set at a level which the Committee considers to  be appropriate taking into consideration the factors outlined in the  'operation' section above  \u00b7  While there is no maximum base salary, normally increases will be  in line with the typical level of increase awarded to other employees  in the Group but may be higher in certain circumstances. These  circumstances may include: -  where a new executive Director has been appointed at a lower  salary, higher increases may be awarded over an initial period as the  executive Director gains in experience and the salary is moved to  what the Committee considers is an appropriate positioning; | \u00b7  The entitlement of individuals participating in de/fined contribution schemes  re/flects the accumulated individual and matching company contributions paid  into the schemes. At present no Ireland-based executive Directors are members  of a de/fined contribution scheme \u00b7  In relation to Mr. Manifold, who joined the Group prior to 31 December 2011,  the de/fined bene/fit pension is provided through an Irish-revenue approved  retirement bene/fit scheme (the 'Scheme'). Accrued bene/fits for service to 31  December 2011 were based on pensionable salary and years of service as at  that date (annual accrual of 1/60th), with this tranche being revalued annually  at the Consumer Price Index subject to a 5% ceiling. For service subsequent to  that date a career-average revalued earnings system was introduced with each  year of service being subject to annual revaluation on the same basis as outlined |",

The current limit of \u20ac1,200,000 was set by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held in 2022\n\n## Other Items\n\n- \u00b7  The non-executive Directors do not participate in any of the Company's performance-related incentive plans or share schemes\n- \u00b7  Non-executive Directors do not receive pensions\n- \u00b7  Where relevant, the Group Chairman may be reimbursed for expenses incurred in travelling from his residence to his CRH of/fice on a gross up basis so that he is not at a net loss after deduction of tax\n- \u00b7  Bene/fits including retirement gifts (provided they do not exceed the de minimis threshold outlined on page 125) may be provided if, in the view of the Board (for non-executive Directors or for the Chairman), this is considered appropriate. The Company may gross up any expenses so that the nonexecutive Directors are not at a net loss after deduction of tax. Details regarding any bene/fit provided will be disclosed in the relevant year of receipt\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n## Service Contracts for Executive Directors\n\nThe Chief Executive and Chief Financial Of/ficer have entered into service contracts, details of which are summarised on page 95 of the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F. All incentive arrangements remain at the discretion of the Committee.\n\nUnder Irish company law, CRH is not required to make service contracts available for inspection as the notice period is no more than 12 months. Service contracts will only be available with the executive Directors' consent due to data protection reasons.\n\n## Non-executive Directors - Letters of Appointment\n\nNon-executive Directors serve under letters of appointment, copies of which are available for inspection at the Company's Registered Of/fice and at the AGM.\n\nIn line with the 2018 Code, all non-executive Directors submit themselves for re-election by shareholders every year at the AGM. All non-executive Director appointments can be terminated by either party without notice. There is no payment in lieu of notice provided.\n\n## Shareholding Guideline for Executive Directors\n\nExecutive Directors are required to build up (and maintain) a minimum holding in CRH shares. The shareholding guidelines for the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Of/ficer are 3.5 times basic salary and 2.5 times basic salary respectively, with the guidelines to be achieved by 31 December 2023 and 1 June 2024, respectively.\n\nFor the purposes of determining the number of shares held by the executive Directors, the relevant calculation will include shares bene/ficially owned by the executive Directors, annual bonus awards which are deferred into shares for three years and PSP awards that have met the /financial performance criteria but are subject to a two-year holding period prior to release (on a net of tax basis). The deferred share awards and PSP awards subject to a two-year hold period are not subject to any further performance criteria other than continued employment with the Group. In the event that the shareholding guidelines are not met by the applicable deadlines, the Remuneration Committee will consider what action to take at that time.\n\n## Post-employment Holding Requirements\n\nThe Chief Executive and Chief Financial Of/ficer are required to hold shares equivalent to 2 times and 1.5 times basic salary respectively for a period of two years post-employment in a third-party trust. Until the limit is achieved, an agreed portion of any Deferred Share or PSP awards which vest will be transferred on a net of tax basis to the third-party to be held in trust for their bene/fit. The shares will be held in trust on a rolling basis, until their employment ceases and a subsequent two-year period has elapsed.\n\n## External Board Appointments\n\nExecutive Directors may accept external non-executive directorships with the prior approval of the Board. The Board recognises the bene/fits that such appointments can bring both to the Company and to the Director in terms of broadening their knowledge and experience. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Group is considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Considering Employee Views\n\nThe Board is regularly kept abreast of employees' perspectives and takes them into account when making decisions. In particular, the Remuneration Committee has oversight of remuneration policy across the Group and endeavours to keep the structure of remuneration consistent as far as possible. Further details of how the Committee seeks and takes into account employee views when setting remuneration for the executive Directors is set out on page 109.",

        "page_content": "## Consulting with Shareholders\n\nThe Committee believes that it is very important to maintain open dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. CRH consults regularly with shareholders and engaged extensively with shareholders in relation to the 2022 Policy. Shareholder views, and broad indications of support, were important in shaping the 2022 Policy.\n\nThe Committee will continue to liaise with shareholders regarding remuneration matters more generally and CRH arrangements as appropriate. It is the Committee's intention to continue to consult with major shareholders in advance of making any material changes to remuneration arrangements.\n\n## Remuneration Outcomes in different Performance Scenarios\n\nRemuneration at CRH consists of /fixed pay (salary, pension and bene/fits), short-term variable pay and long-term variable pay. A signi/ficant portion of\n\nexecutive Directors' remuneration is linked to the delivery of key business goals over the short and long-term and the creation of shareholder value. Table 25 shows hypothetical values of the remuneration package for executive Directors under four assumed performance scenarios (based on 2023 proposals). No share price growth or the payment of dividend equivalents has been assumed in these scenarios (other than where speci/fied). Potential bene/fits under all-employee share schemes have not been included.\n\n## Remuneration Outcomes in different Performance Scenarios\n\nTable 23\n\nTable 25\n\n| Performance Scenario                                                                                        | Payout Level                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Minimum                                                                                                     | \u00b7  Fixed pay (see Table 24 for each executive Director) \u00b7  No bonus payout \u00b7  No vesting under the Performance Share Plan                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| On-target performance                                                                                       | \u00b7  Fixed pay (see Table 24 for each executive Director) \u00b7  50% annual bonus payout (112.5% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% for the Chief Financial Of/ficer) \u00b7  25% vesting under the Performance Share Plan (91.25% of salary for the Chief Executive and 62.5% for the Chief  Financial Of/ficer) |\n| Maximum performance                (at constant share prices and  assuming a 50% increase in   share price) | \u00b7  Fixed pay (see Table 24 for each executive Director) \u00b7  100% annual bonus payout (225% of salary for the Chief Executive and 200% of salary for the Chief Financial Of/ficer) \u00b7  100% Performance Share Plan vesting (365% of salary for the Chief Executive and 250% for the Chief Financial  Of/ficer)    |\n\n## Hypothetical Remuneration Values\n\nTable 24\n\n|                                        | Salary  With effect from   1 January 2023   | Benefits  Level paid  in 2022 (i)   | Estimated   Pension (ii)   | Total   Fixed Pay   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|\n| Chief Executive (Albert Manifold)      | \u20ac1,709,442                                  | \u20ac31,000                             | NIL                        | \u20ac1,740,442          |\n| Chief Financial Of/ficer (Jim Mintern) | \u20ac891,182                                    | \u20ac32,000                             | \u20ac89,118                    | \u20ac1,012,300          |\n\n- (i)     Based on 2022 expenses.\n- (ii)    See page 123 for details in relation to retirement bene/fit arrangements.\n\n## Performance-related Remuneration Outcomes\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\n## Annual Report on Remuneration\n\n## The Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee consists of seven non-executive Directors considered by the Board to be independent. They bring the range of experience of large organisations and public companies, including experience in the area of senior executive remuneration, to enable the Committee to ful/fil its role. Their biographical details are set out on pages 82 to 84. A schedule of attendance at Committee meetings is set out in Table 8 on page 100.\n\nThe main focus of the Committee is to:\n\n- \u00b7 determine and agree with the Board the Group's policy on executive remuneration;\n- \u00b7 seek shareholder approval for the Directors' Remuneration Policy at least every three years;\n- \u00b7 ensure that CRH's remuneration structures are fair and responsible; and\n- \u00b7 consider and approve salaries and other terms of the remuneration packages for the executive Directors and the fee for the Chairman\n\nIn addition, the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 recommends and monitors the level and structure of remuneration for senior management; and\n- \u00b7 oversees the preparation of this Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nIn considering remuneration levels for executive Directors particularly, the Committee takes into account remuneration trends across the CRH Group, which has a diverse range of operations in 29 countries, in geographic regions which are often at different stages in the economic cycle.\n\nThe Committee also engages regularly with shareholders and employees on the structure of the remuneration policy and executive incentives (see pages 118 and 109 respectively for more details).\n\n## Remuneration received by executive Directors in respect of 2022\n\nDetails of individual remuneration for executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2022, including explanatory notes, are given in Table 20 on page 112. Details of Directors' remuneration charged against pro/fit in the year are given in Table 45 on page 132.\n\nThe Group changed its reporting currency from euro to US Dollar with effect from 1 January 2020. Notwithstanding this, as the executive Directors are paid in euro, the Committee considers it appropriate that the remuneration /figures disclosed in this Report continue to be presented in euro.\n\n## 2022 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nCRH's Annual Bonus Plan for 2022 was based on a combination of /financial targets and personal/strategic goals. The metrics for target payout, which is up to a maximum of 50% of the total annual bonus opportunity, are based on achieving the budget set by the Board in respect of each metric. The threshold level for bonus payouts in 2022 was for the achievement of 92.5% of budget, whereas maximum payout is achieved for stretch performance of 107.5% of budget. The relative weighting of the components of the 2022 plan are set out in Table 26 on page 120.\n\nWhen setting the targets for the annual bonus plan, the Committee makes assumptions regarding exchange rates and development activity. The Committee also compares the proposed targets to the outturn for the previous year to ensure that the targets are suf/ficiently stretching. In this regard, it is important to note that the metrics in the plan are in/fluenced by the economic cycle and other factors, such as ongoing portfolio management, government infrastructure spending programmes and items outside of management's control and which may not continue into the next /financial year.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nWhen reviewing performance against the bonus plan, the Committee typically makes a number of routine adjustments to the /financial targets, for example, to re/flect signi/ficant development activity and actual share buyback activity during the year.\n\nThe /financial targets for the 2022 annual bonus plan, which represent 80% of the potential bonus opportunity, were set in early 2022. As a result of the record /financial performance of the Group in 2022 and the highest ever EBITDA (as de/fined)* outturn of $5.6 billion, the maximum target under each of the /financial metrics was exceeded, resulting in a calculated payout level of 100%. Further details are set out in Table 26 on page 120.\n\nThe remaining 20% of the 2022 Annual Bonus Plan was linked to performance against key personal and strategic objectives. The Remuneration Committee assessed the achievements under the objectives set for 2022, as outlined in Table 26 on page 120, and concluded that they were met to the fullest extent possible.\n\nNotwithstanding the outperformance of the target ranges set for the /financial metrics during the year, and the personal/strategic goals being met to the fullest extent possible, in the context of the uncertain economic climate and backdrop of high in/flation and rising costs, both management and the Committee judged that it would be appropriate to cap the bonus outcome at 85% of maximum.\n\nIn determining this outcome, the Committee considered input from the SESR Committee that, following an in-depth review of safety performance and, in particular, reportable fatalities which occurred during 2022, the exercise of downward discretion on bonus outcomes would not be warranted in its view. In reaching that conclusion, the SESR Committee was satis/fied that none of the reportable fatalities was attributable to a lack of applicable training, de/ficient safety procedures or defective equipment being used. Furthermore, through detailed analysis and discussion of a range of measures, as well as through engagement with employees, the SESR Committee was satis/fied that the appropriate safety culture is in place across the Group. Following discussion, the Committee concurred with the SESR Committee and concluded that downward discretion on the 2022 bonus outcomes outlined above should not be applied.\n\nIn accordance with the Policy, 33.3% of the bonus amounts for Albert Manifold and Jim Mintern will be deferred into shares for a period of three years. Deferred Share awards are not subject to any additional performance conditions during the deferral period and are adjusted for dividend equivalents based on dividends paid by CRH. Annual bonus awards are subject to recovery provisions for three years from the date of payment (cash awards) or grant (deferred awards).\n\n## Long-term Incentives\n\n## Performance Share Plan - 2020 awards\n\nIn 2020, the executive Directors were granted conditional awards under the 2014 Performance Share Plan. The awards were based on TSR (25% of the award) against a tailored group of key peers (see Table 29 on page 121), Cumulative Cash Flow (50% of the award) and RONA (25% of the award), and performance was measured over the three-year period 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. In respect of the TSR element, CRH's TSR over the period ranked in the top quartile of the tailored peer group weighted by market capitalisation and warrants 100% vesting for the TSR element. In respect of the cumulative cash /flow element, the actual outturn over the period was $8.7 billion, resulting in 100% vesting for the cash /flow element. In respect of the RONA element, the actual outturn was 13.5%, resulting in 100% vesting for the RONA element. Table 27 on page 121 sets out the targets for cash/flow and RONA set by the Committee in 2020.\n\nWhen reviewing performance against the targets, the Committee considered a number of adjustments consistent with best practice, for example, to neutralise the impact of signi/ficant acquisitions and divestments, and the impairment of subsidiaries in 2020 (as described in the 2020 Annual Report and Form 20-F).",

The 2020 award for Jim Mintern was granted prior to his appointment as Chief Financial Of/ficer\n\nand, under the terms of the award, is not subject to an additional holding period. Accordingly, the award will vest in April 2023. Vested awards will be adjusted to accrue dividend equivalents based on dividends in the period from grant to the applicable date of vesting.

Operating cash /flow and RONA have been de/fined as reported internally. For cash /flow the /figure differs from the net cash in/flow from operating activities reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, primarily because it is calculated after deducting cash out/flows on the purchase of property, plant and equipment (PP&E), net proceeds from the disposal of PP&E, and before deducting interest and tax payments.

The de/finition of cash /flow, which applies to the cash metric for all PSP awards, is the net increase/decrease in cash and cash equivalents adjusted to exclude:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends to shareholders;\n- \u00b7 acquisition/investment expenditure;\n- \u00b7 proceeds from divestments and movements in working capital;\n- \u00b7 share issues (scrip dividend, share options, other);\n- \u00b7 /financing cash /flows (new loans/repayments);\n- \u00b7 back funding pension schemes; and\n- \u00b7 foreign exchange translation\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers that it is appropriate to make these adjustments to align with the performance targets, or to remove items that do not re/flect the quality of management's operational performance, or are largely outside of the Company's control. The Remuneration Committee will also make adjustments that may be required to cash /flows, for example, as a result of acquisitions/divestments completed during the performance period or a signi/ficant underspend or delay in budgeted capital expenditure, both ordinary and extraordinary.\n\n20% of each award is subject to a TSR metric, with performance being measured against a tailored peer group and on a market capitalisation weighted basis (see Table 29 on page 121).\n\n20% of each award is subject to a RONA metric, a key measure used by management to assess investment opportunities and to run the business.\n\nThe remaining 15% of each award is subject to performance over key sustainability & diversity metrics, including the drive to carbon neutrality (5%), revenue from products with enhanced sustainability attributes (5%) and inclusion and diversity (5%). Performance for the awards made in 2022 will be assessed over the three-year period to 31 December 2024. Details of the performance targets are set out in Table 30 on page 122.\n\nAwards, to the extent that they vest, will be adjusted for dividend equivalents based on dividends in the period from grant to the date of vesting in 2025.\n\n'Malus' and clawback provisions apply to the awards.\n\n## Other Employee Share Plans\n\nThe executive Directors are eligible to participate in Irish Revenue approved Savings-related Option Schemes (the 'SAYE Scheme') and Share Participation Schemes (the 'Participation Scheme') on consistent terms with all other employees. The SAYE Scheme is open to all Irish and UK employees, although at present there is currently no /financial services provider supporting new awards under Irish SAYE schemes following the\n\n## Pension Entitlements - De/fined Bene/fit (Audited)\n\nTable 32\n\n| Executive Director   | Increase in accrued personal pension during 2022 (i) \u20ac000   |   Transfer value of increase in dependants  pension (i)   \u20ac000 Total accrued personal pension at year |   end (ii)   \u20ac000 |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Albert Manifold      | -                                                           |                                                                                                   100 |               273 |\n\nexit from the market of the provider in 2021. Participants may save up to \u20ac500/\u00a3500 a month from their net salaries for a /fixed term of three or /five years and at the end of the savings period they have the option to buy CRH shares at a discount of up to 15% of the market price on the date of invitation of each savings contract. Details of the outstanding awards of executive Directors under the 2010 SAYE Scheme are set out in Table 33 on page 124.\n\nThe Participation Scheme is an Irish Revenue approved plan and is open to all employees in Ireland. Grants can be made to participants up to a maximum of \u20ac12,700 annually in CRH shares. Albert Manifold and Jim Mintern participated in the Participation Scheme in 2022.\n\n## Retirement Benefit Expense\n\nAlbert Manifold is a participant in a contributory de/fined bene/fit plan which is based on an accrual rate of 1/60th of salary (de/fined as basic salary and excludes any /fluctuating emoluments) for each year of pensionable service and is designed to provide two-thirds of career average salary at retirement for full service. Albert Manifold will become entitled to a deferred pension, payable from Normal Retirement Age, if he leaves service prior to Normal Retirement Age. The Finance Act 2006 established a cap on pension provisions by introducing a penalty tax charge on pension assets in excess of the higher of \u20ac5.4 million (in the Finance Act 2011, this threshold was reduced to \u20ac2.3 million and reduced further to \u20ac2 million by the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013) or the value of individual accrued pension entitlements as at 7 December 2005.\n\nAs a result of these legislative changes, the Remuneration Committee decided that executive Directors should have the option of continuing to accrue pension bene/fits as previously, or of choosing an alternative arrangement-by accepting pension bene/fits limited by the cap-with a similar overall cost to the Group. Albert Manifold has opted for an arrangement whereby his pension is capped in line with the provisions of the Finance Act 2006 and receives a supplementary taxable nonpensionable cash supplement in lieu of pension bene/fits foregone. There was, therefore, no additional accrual in 2022. The cash pension supplement for 2022 is detailed in Table 20 on page 112. This supplement was similar in value to the reduction in the Company's liability represented by the pension bene/fits foregone. It was calculated based on actuarial advice as the equivalent of the reduction in the Company's liability to Mr. Manifold and spread over the term to retirement as annual compensation allowances. In 2020, Mr. Manifold agreed to a voluntary reduction of 10% of the amount that would otherwise have been due to him. This was reduced by a further 10% in 2021 and was reduced to 25% in January in 2022. His contractual entitlement to compensation in lieu of pension payments ceased in August 2022 when he reached age 60. The contributory de/fined bene/fit plan in which Albert Manifold participates closed to new entrants at the end of 2011. Details regarding the pension entitlements of Albert Manifold are set out in Table 32.\n\nJim Mintern receives a taxable non-pensionable cash payment of 10% of salary in lieu of a pension contribution in line with that available to the wider UK and Irish workforce.",

The Committee has reviewed the executive Directors' base salaries and concluded that salary increases of 3.5% should be awarded to the executive Directors in 2023 in recognition of their continued strong performance, contribution and leadership of CRH.\n\nIncreases in salary for employees across the Group in 2023 will depend on a range of factors speci/fic to a region or business. In Ireland increases will generally be 4.25%, while increases in the UK will be c. 4.5%.\n\nThe level of bene/fits provided will depend on the cost of providing individual items and the individual circumstances.\n\n## Retirement Benefit Expense\n\nAs outlined in the Remuneration Committee Chairman's overview on page 108, the monetary value of the pension contribution/allowance for Mr. Manifold ceased in August 2022. The annual pension contribution/ allowance for Jim Mintern remains at 10% of his base salary.\n\n## 2023 Annual Bonus Plan\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has determined that the 2023 Annual Bonus Plan will be operated broadly in line with the 2022 Annual Bonus Plan. 80% of the bonus will be based on /financial targets and the remaining 20% on individual objectives aligned to key strategic areas for each executive Director. The targets attaching to the 2023 bonus will be disclosed in the 2023 Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## 2023 Performance Share Plan Awards\n\nFor the 2023 PSP awards, awards will be assessed over the three-year period to 31 December 2025. The metrics, weightings and opportunity for the 2023 PSP awards are summarised in Table 35 on page 126.\n\n## Fees Paid to Former Directors\n\nThe 2013 Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment Regulations) Regulations in the UK, require disclosure of payments to former Directors in certain circumstances. No payments have been made to individual former Directors in those circumstances which exceed the de minimis threshold of \u20ac20,000 per annum set by the\n\nRemuneration Committee. For the purposes of Section 1110N of the Companies Act 2014, details of the payments made to former Directors are included in Table 45 on page 132.\n\nSenan Murphy retired from the Board following the 2021 AGM and as Finance Director on 1 June 2021. He continued as an employee until May 2022 to facilitate the completion of a number of projects/initiatives. Following his retirement in May 2022, the Remuneration Committee determined that Mr. Murphy be treated as a 'good leaver'. Accordingly, the Deferred Shares in respect of the bonuses granted in 2020, 2021 and 2022 were released to him, and his unvested award under the 2014 PSP (i.e. the award made in 2021) will be released on its normal release date subject to performance (to be measured at the normal time) and the normal two-year holding period. His vested PSP awards (i.e. the awards made in 2018, 2019 and 2020) will be released at the normal release date following the completion of the two-year hold period. Further details of Mr. Murphy's awards were set out on pages 102 and 103 of the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F. In line with our Policy, he also remains subject to a postemployment holding requirement.\n\n## Executives' External Appointments\n\nThe executive Directors may accept external appointments with the prior approval of the Board provided that such appointments do not prejudice the individual's ability to ful/fil their duties at the Group. Whether any related fees are retained by the individual or remitted to the Group is considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Workforce Engagement\n\nEngagement of our workforce is at the heart of what we do at CRH. The proximity of our senior leaders to daily operations across CRH is a key reason for the Company's continued success and growth. The Company operates an annual talent and performance review process, where colleagues and their managers work together to review performance and set annual goals. The outcome of the review process is closely aligned to remuneration, both in terms of any increase in base salary for the next year, and any variable remuneration component.\n\nIn order to guide our leaders' discussions with employees across the group on remuneration structures, there is a reward policy section, which is based on the principles of remuneration applied by the Remuneration Committee and remuneration policy approved by shareholders, in policy documents issued to the managing directors of our operating companies.\n\nAs outlined on page 89, responsibility for employee engagement transferred from the SESR Committee to the Nomination & Corporate Governance Committee in January 2023. The Remuneration Committee members are kept up to date on the feedback from employee engagement activities, including in relation to remuneration. Further details in relation to the engagement with employees on remuneration matters during 2022 is included on page 109.\n\nTable 34 illustrates the current shareholdings of the executive Directors as a multiple of base salary.\n\n|             | Guideline   (%  of Salary)   | To be  achieved by   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023   | Holdings as of 1 March 2023    | Total Interests  (% of Salary)   |\n|-------------|------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|             | Guideline   (%  of Salary)   | To be  achieved by   |                               | 187%                          | 91%                           | 410%                          |                               |                               |                               | Value of shares  (% of salary) | 688%                             |\n| A.

A Committee of the Chairman and the executive Directors considered and approved a 3.5% increase in the fees of the non-executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2023. The Remuneration Committee considered and approved a 3.5% increase for the Chairman. Both increases are in line with the increase received by the executive Directors (see Table 36 for details of the fees applicable with effect from 1 January 2023). Details of the remuneration paid to non-executive Directors in 2022 are set out in Table 37.\n\n## Changes in the remuneration of the Directors\n\nTable 44 on page 131 shows the annual percentage change in the executive and non-executive Directors' salary/fees, bene/fits and bonus between 2020 and 2022 compared to the change in total average employment costs in respect of employees in the Group as a whole between 2020 and 2022.\n\n## Total Shareholder Return\n\nThe value at 31 December 2022 of \u20ac100 invested in CRH in 2012, compared with the value of \u20ac100 invested in the Euro/first 300 Index and the FTSE100 Index (which CRH joined in December 2011) is shown in Table 38 on page 128.\n\nTSR performance has been compared against the FTSE100 and the Euro/first 300 as these are broad general market indices of which CRH is a constituent. The Committee, therefore, considers that they offer a reasonable comparison for performance. Compound annual TSR since the formation of the Group in 1970 (assuming the reinvestment of dividends) is 14.8% (2021: 15.5%).\n\n## Remuneration paid to Chief Executive 2013 - 2022\n\nTable 39 on page 128 shows the total remuneration paid to the Chief Executive in the period 2013 to 2022 inclusive and shows bonuses and vested long-term incentive awards as a percentage of the maximum bonus and award that could have been received in respect of each year. Albert Manifold succeeded Myles Lee as Chief Executive in January 2014.\n\nTable 37\n\n| Non-executive Director Fee Structure                                                 | Table 36   | Table 36   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Role                                                                                 | 2023       | 2022       |\n| Group Chairman (including non-executive Director salary and fees for Committee work) | \u20ac669,750   | \u20ac647,250   |\n| Basic non-executive Director fee                                                     | \u20ac93,400    | \u20ac90,250    |\n| Committee fee                                                                        | \u20ac33,900    | \u20ac32,750    |\n| Additional fees                                                                      |            |            |\n| Senior Independent Director                                                          | \u20ac26,400    | \u20ac25,500    |\n| Remuneration Committee Chairman                                                      | \u20ac31,825    | \u20ac30,750    |\n| Audit Committee Chairman                                                             | \u20ac41,400    | \u20ac40,000    |\n| Combined Senior Independent Director and Committee Chairman                          | \u20ac41,400    | \u20ac40,000    |\n| SESR Committee Chairman                                                              | \u20ac31,825    | \u20ac30,750    |\n| Fee for Europe-based non-executive Directors                                         | \u20ac15,500    | \u20ac15,000    |\n| Fee for US-based non-executive Directors                                             | \u20ac31,000    | \u20ac30,000    |\n\n## Individual Remuneration for Non-executive Directors for the year ended 31 December 2022 (Audited)\n\n|                         | Basic fees (i)   \u20ac000   | Basic fees (i)   \u20ac000   | Benefits (ii)  \u20ac000   | Benefits (ii)  \u20ac000   | Other fees (iii)  \u20ac000   | Other fees (iii)  \u20ac000   | Total  \u20ac000   | Total  \u20ac000   | Total  \u20ac000   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                         | 2022                    | 2021                    | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2022          | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Non-executive Directors |                         |                         |                       |                       |                          |                          |               |               |               |\n| R.

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Pay Ratio compared to UK-based Employees\n\nAs required by the reporting regulations with which CRH complies, Table 40 summarises the ratio of the Chief Executive's remuneration compared with the UK workforce (which represents only 13% of the Group's c.75,800 employees). In last year's Report, the Committee noted an expectation for year-on-year variations in the reported pay ratio to be driven by performance-based pay outcomes which, in line with our remuneration policy, comprise a signi/ficant proportion of the total remuneration for the Chief Executive. While the majority of employees across CRH also participate in performance-related incentives, these typically comprise a lower proportion of the package (in line with competitive market practices for these roles and levels). Consistent with our philosophy across the Group that incentives should be linked to performance that an individual can in/fluence, these more commonly re/flect an individual's own (and own business unit) performance, compared with a linkage to Group performance for the Chief Executive and other senior executives.\n\nIn keeping with our remuneration philosophy and policy, a signi/ficant proportion of the total remuneration for executive Directors is derived from variable, performance-based remuneration. Total remuneration for the Chief Executive- and therefore the pay ratio- is likely to vary year-on-year\n\n## Chief Executive Pay Ratios\n\n## Total Remuneration Pay Ratios compared to UK-based Employees\n\nTable 40\n\nTable 41\n\n| Year   | Calculation   | P25 (lower quartile)   | P25 (lower quartile)   | P50 (median)        | P50 (median)   | P75 (upper quartile)   | P75 (upper quartile)   | Chief Executive    |\n|--------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Year   | Methodology   | Total  remuneration    | Ratio                  | Total  remuneration | Ratio          | Total  remuneration    | Ratio                  | Total remuneration |\n| 2022   | C             | \u20ac35,000                | 345:1                  | \u20ac46,600             | 259:1          | \u20ac59,700                | 202:1                  | \u20ac12,071,100        |\n| 2021   | C             | \u20ac35,700                | 390:1                  | \u20ac48,200             | 289:1          | \u20ac62,400                | 223:1                  | \u20ac13,906,922        |\n| 2020   | C             | \u20ac30,400                | 368:1                  | \u20ac42,000             | 267:1          | \u20ac54,600                | 205:1                  | \u20ac11,200,211        |\n| 2019   | C             | \u20ac32,200                | 289:1                  | \u20ac44,900             | 207:1          | \u20ac58,900                | 158:1                  | \u20ac9,311,400         |\n\n## Salary Pay Ratios compared to UK-based Employees\n\n| Year   | Calculation   | P25 (lower quartile)   | P25 (lower quartile)   | P50 (median)   | P50 (median)   | P75 (upper quartile)   | P75 (upper quartile)   | Chief Executive   |\n|--------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Year   | Methodology   | Salary                 | Ratio                  | Salary         | Ratio          | Total  remuneration    | Ratio                  | Salary            |\n| 2022   | C             | \u20ac30,200                | 55:1                   | \u20ac37,300        | 44:1           | \u20ac46,900                | 35:1                   | \u20ac1,651,600        |\n| 2021   | C             | \u20ac26,900                | 60:1                   | \u20ac36,800        | 44:1           | \u20ac54,400                | 30:1                   | \u20ac1,607,400        |\n| 2020   | C             | \u20ac28,200                | 52:1                   | \u20ac37,800        | 39:1           | \u20ac46,800                | 31:1                   | \u20ac1,469,100        |\n| 2019   | C             | \u20ac28,500                | 53:1                   | \u20ac42,400        | 36:1           | \u20ac49,900                | 31:1                   | \u20ac1,522,500        |\n\n- 1.

Total remuneration for the lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees are determined using the 'single /figure' methodology. This methodology was chosen as it provides a like-for-like comparison between the CEO and other employees. For practical reasons (primarily relating to the number of employing entities and employees covered by this analysis), the ranking of employees to identify the three individuals representing P25, P50 and P75 is conducted in November each year. Given the timing, for the purpose of the ranking exercise, total remuneration is de/fined as the sum of base salary, employer pension contributions and other taxable bene/fits for the period 1 January to 31 October, and the incentive paid in the period in respect of the prior year. All elements of remuneration are calculated on a full-time and full-year equivalent basis. In the following January, total remuneration is updated for the three employees representing P25, P50 and P75 using the same single /figure methodology used to report CEO remuneration.\n- 4. The Committee considered the pay data for the three individuals identi/fied and believes that they fairly re/flect pay at the relevant quartiles amongst the UK employee population, albeit noting the exact /figures are likely to vary slightly year-on-year due to changes in the employee population and thus the identi/fied individuals by the selection methodology. The Committee reviewed the underlying rationale for the year-on-year change in the quartile /figures for the identi/fied UK employees. The total remuneration outcomes re/flect another year of strong performance by our UK businesses (which forms the basis of bonus payouts for eligible employees in this sample), with increasing variability in the package observed at the P75 level; for which a greater proportion of the package is performancebased. The Committee also notes the year-on-year variance in salaries at the quartiles, which re/flects the fact that the individuals were selected based on total remuneration and the pay mix differs by role, location and operating company. On a like-for-like basis, the budgeted salary increase across the UK workforce in 2022 was 2.75%.\n\nbased on the Group's performance, as illustrated in the scenario charts on page 118. Noting that the total remuneration pay ratio will be volatile over time, the Committee has elected to continue also disclosing the pay ratio for base salary. In line with the Committee's policy that executive Directors' base salaries will normally increase in line with the typical level of increase awarded to other employees in the Group, it is anticipated that this ratio will be more stable - and representative of relative changes in /fixed pay - over time.\n\nThe median total remuneration pay ratio for 2022 of 259:1 demonstrates continued alignment of the Chief Executive's remuneration with the performance of CRH over the longer-term. A signi/ficant proportion (56%) of the Chief Executive's total remuneration for 2022 is derived from the vesting of the 2020 PSP award, which was based on the delivery of sustained /financial performance and above-market shareholder returns over the last three years. Through the denomination of this award in CRH shares, its value also directly re/flects CRH's share price performance over this period; 16% of the PSP value reported in the Single Figure of Total Remuneration table derives from share price appreciation and accrued dividends (i.e. total shareholder return). These shares cannot be sold for a further two years, further aligning the Chief Executive's interests with those of shareholders over the longer-term.",

We have also shown the change in EBITDA (as de/fined)* performance year-on-year to provide an indication of the change in pro/fit performance.\n\n## Advisers to the Remuneration Committee\n\nIn 2022, Ellason acted as the Committee's independent remuneration consultants. The Committee has satis/fied itself that the advice provided by Ellason is robust and independent and that the Ellason engagement partner and team that provide remuneration advice to the Committee do not have connections with CRH plc that may impair their independence. Ellason are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. During 2022, Ellason provided the following remuneration services:\n\n- \u00b7 research and advice regarding remuneration trends, best practice and remuneration levels for executive and non-executive Directors in companies of similar size and complexity;\n- \u00b7 advice in relation to remuneration matters generally; and\n- \u00b7 attendance at Committee meetings, when required\n\nIn 2022, the total fees paid to Ellason were \u00a354,162.\n\n## 2022 Annual General Meeting\n\nThe voting outcome in respect of the remuneration-related votes at the 2022 AGM is set out in Table 19 on page 111.\n\nLamar McKay Chair of Remuneration Committee 1 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report\n\nThe Directors submit their report and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## Principal Activity, Results for the Year and Review of Business\n\nCRH is the leading building materials business in the world, employing c.75,800 people at c.3,160 locations in 29 countries. CRH manufactures and supplies a range of building materials, products and innovative solutions for the construction industry. From primary materials, to products that are highly engineered and high-value-added, to integrated building solutions that enable faster, more sustainable construction, CRH is uniquely positioned to address evolving trends in global construction markets. Our products can be found throughout the built environment in a wide range of construction projects from major public infrastructure to homes and commercial buildings. The Group has c.900 subsidiary, joint venture and associate undertakings; the principal ones as at 31 December 2022 are listed on pages 290 to 293.\n\nThe Group's strategy, business model and development activity are summarised on pages 11 to 79 and are deemed to be incorporated in this part of the Directors' Report. As set out in the Consolidated Income Statement on page 176, the Group reported a pro/fit before tax for the year of $3.5 billion from continuing operations. Comprehensive reviews of the /financial and operating performance of the Group during 2022 are set out in the Business Performance section on pages 61 to 79; key /financial performance indicators are set out on page 65.\n\nThe treasury policy and objectives of the Group are set out in detail in note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2022, 29,755,861 ordinary shares were repurchased on the Euronext Dublin for a total of $1.2 billion, at an average price of $39.22 per share. Further details in relation to the buyback programme and the Company's pro/fits available for distribution are set on pages 137 and 241 respectively.\n\n## Dividend\n\nCRH's capital allocation policy re/flects the Group's strategy of generating industry-leading returns through value-accretive allocation of capital while delivering long-term dividend growth for shareholders.The Board continues to believe that a progressive dividend policy is appropriate for the Group\n\n## Non-Financial Reporting\n\nand further to the 5% dividend increase in 2021, an interim dividend of $0.24 (2021: $0.23) per share was paid in October 2022. The Board is recommending a /final dividend of $1.03 per share. This would give a total dividend of $1.27 for the year (2021: $1.21), an increase of 5% over last year. The earnings per share for the year were $3.50, representing a cover of 2.8x the proposed dividend for the year. It is proposed to pay the /final dividend on 4 May 2023 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 17 March 2023. The /final dividend will be paid wholly in cash. Re/flecting the resilience of our business model and continued strong cash generation, the Board believes that a through-the-cycle dividend cover of 2.0 to 2.5 times is appropriate for the Group going forward.\n\n## 2023 Outlook\n\nThe 2023 outlook set out in the Chief Executive's Review on page 15 is deemed to be incorporated in this part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Principal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nPursuant to Section 327(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014, Regulation 5(4) (c)(ii) of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations 2007 (the 'Transparency Regulations') and the Central Bank (Investment Market Conduct) Rules 2019, the principal risks and uncertainties that could affect the Group's business are set out on pages 139 to 148 and are deemed to be incorporated in this part of the Directors' Report. These risks and uncertainties re/flect the international scope of the Group's operations and its decentralised structure.

        "page_content": "## Directors' Report continued\n\n## Going Concern and Viability Statements\n\nThe Group continues to serve the societal need for building materials products and integrated solutions and in doing so creating long-term value and delivering superior returns for all our stakeholders. The Directors have reviewed the long-term prospects of the Group to assess its viability, carrying out a robust assessment of our current position and the principal risks (pages 139 to 148) facing the Group, including those which would threaten its strategy (page 12 to 19), business model (page 20 and 21), future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n\nThe Board's consideration of the long-term prospects of the Group is an extension of the strategic planning process. This process includes regular budget reviews as part of the internal reporting cycle, /financial forecasting and performance reviews, a comprehensive enterprise risk management assessment and scenario planning involving our principal risks and uncertainties. Our business strategy is focused on creating long-term value and delivering superior returns for all our stakeholders through disciplined capital management and operational ef/ficiency.\n\n## Going Concern\n\nThe Group's going concern assessment focuses on immediately available sources of liquidity to fund our anticipated trading pattern, plus anticipated acquisition spend, returns to shareholders and capital investment, ensuring appropriate headroom. The Directors are required to evaluate that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the /financial statements (the 'period of assessment').\n\n## Viability\n\nThe Group's viability assessment focuses on the expected future solvency or liquidity of the Group in the face of more severe, but plausible, unexpected events. The Directors have reviewed the length of time to be covered by the Viability Statement, particularly given its primary purpose of providing investors with a view of /financial viability that goes beyond the period of the Going Concern assessment. A three-year period is considered appropriate for this viability statement for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 it aligns with our normal strategic planning time horizon;\n- \u00b7 construction activity, and therefore demand for the Group's products, is inherently cyclical as it is in/fluenced by global and national economies;\n- \u00b7 it aligns with our long-term management incentives, such as the deferred element of the Annual Performance-related Incentive Plan; and\n- \u00b7 uncertainty increases inherently with expanding time horizons potentially impacting the large number of external variables that need to be factored\n\n## Assessment of Going Concern and Viability\n\nIn carrying out their assessment of going concern and viability, the Directors considered a wide range of information, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position which are set out in the Strategy Review and in this report on pages 11 to 59;\n- \u00b7 the Group's Strategic plan ('the plan') and projections and the /financial position of the Group considering the Group's cash /flows, committed funding and liquidity positions, forecast future funding requirements, other key /financial ratios, including those relevant to maintaining the Group's investment grade credit ratings and the Group's 2030 climate targets; and\n- \u00b7 the /financial position of the Group, its cash /flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities which are described in the Business Performance Review on pages 60 to 79. In addition, notes 21 to 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements include the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its /financial risk management objectives; details of its /financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit, currency and liquidity risks\n\nAppropriate stress testing of certain key performance, solvency and liquidity assumptions, such as continuing operations EBITDA (as de/fined)* margins and Net Debt/EBITDA (as de/fined)*, underlying the plan has been conducted taking account of the principal risks and uncertainties faced and possible severe but plausible combinations of those risks and uncertainties. For more detail on our principal risks and uncertainties, how they could impact the Group and how the Group manages these risks, see pages 139 to 148.\n\n## Scenario Modelled\n\n## Scenario 1: Recessionary Environment\n\nEconomic slowdown/recession resulting in revenue reductions and margin compression\n\n## Scenario 2: One-off Expense\n\nImpact of a potential large event, /fine and/or penalty\n\n## Scenario 3: Combination (1&2)\n\nCombination of prior scenarios overlapping or occurring simultaneously\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the Board acknowledges that the potential severity, complexity and velocity of the risks assessed may change, based on its review of the Group's activities, cash /flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities for the period of assessment, and having assessed the principal risks facing the Group, the Board has a reasonable expectation that CRH plc, and the Group as a whole, has adequate /financial and other resources to continue in operational existence for the period of assessment and will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the aforementioned 12-month going concern period and three-year viability assessment period to 31 December 2025. For this reason, the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control 1\n\nThe Directors con/firm that, in addition to the monitoring carried out by the Audit Committee under its Terms of Reference, they have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems up to and including the date of approval of the /financial statements. This review had regard to all material controls, including /financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the Group's business.\n\n*EBITDA is de/fined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, pro/fit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' pro/fit after tax.\n\n## Relevant Principal Risks\n\n- \u00b7  Industry Cyclicality and Economic Conditions\n- \u00b7 Portfolio Management\n- \u00b7 Public Policy and Geopolitics\n- \u00b7  Laws, Regulations and Business Conduct\n- \u00b7 Public Policy and Geopolitics\n- \u00b7  Information Technology and Cyber Security\n- \u00b7  Combination of relevant risks from prior scenarios",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\n## Directors' Compliance Statement\n\nIt is the policy of the Company to comply with its relevant obligations (as de/fined in the Companies Act 2014). The Directors have drawn up a compliance policy statement (as de/fined in section 225(3)(a) of the Companies Act 2014) and arrangements and structures are in place that are, in the Directors' opinion, designed to secure material compliance with the Company's relevant obligations. The Directors con/firm that these arrangements and structures were reviewed during the /financial year. As required by Section 225(2) of the Companies Act 2014, the Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the Company's compliance with the relevant obligations. In discharging their responsibilities under Section 225, the Directors relied on the advice both of persons employed by the Company and of persons retained by the Company under contract, who they believe have the requisite knowledge and experience to advise the Company on compliance with its relevant obligations.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nResolution 3 to be proposed at the 2023 AGM deals with the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy summary), as set out on pages 108 to 132, which is being presented to shareholders for the purposes of a non-binding advisory vote in line with the requirements of Section 1110N(6) of the Companies Act, 2014.\n\n## Changes to the Board of Directors\n\nUnder the Company's Articles of Association, co-opted Directors are required to submit themselves to shareholders for election at the AGM following their appointment and all Directors are required to submit themselves for re-election at intervals of not more than three years. However, in accordance with the provisions contained in the 2018 Code, the Board has decided that all Directors eligible for re-election should retire at each AGM and offer themselves for re-election.\n\n## Auditor\n\nAs required under Section 381(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014, the AGM agenda includes a resolution authorising the Directors to /fix the remuneration of the auditor. Section 383 of the Companies Act 2014 provides for the automatic re-appointment of the auditor of an Irish company at a company's AGM, unless the auditor has given notice in writing of their unwillingness to be re-appointed or a resolution has been passed at that meeting appointing someone else or providing expressly that the incumbent auditor shall not be re-appointed. The auditor, Deloitte Ireland LLP, is willing to continue in of/fice.\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of Irish company law, the Board has decided to provide shareholders with an opportunity to have a say on the continuance in of/fice of Deloitte Ireland LLP and a non-binding resolution has been included on the agenda for the 2023 AGM for this purpose.\n\n## Authority to Allot Shares\n\nThe Directors require the authority of the shareholders to allot any unissued Ordinary Share capital of the Company. Accordingly, an ordinary resolution will be proposed at the 2023 AGM (Resolution 7) to renew the annual authority for that purpose. The authority will be for an amount which represents just under 50% of the issued Ordinary Share capital as at 1 March 2023. Any allotment exceeding 33% of the issued Ordinary Share capital will only be made pursuant to a pre-emptive issue and no issue of shares will be made which could effectively alter control of the Company without prior approval of the Company in General Meeting.\n\nThe Directors have no present intention of making any issue of shares, other than in connection with the Group's share incentive plans.\n\nIf approved, this authority will expire on the earlier of the date of the AGM in 2024 or 26 July 2024.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n## Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights\n\nResolution 8 is a special resolution which, if approved by shareholders, will renew the annual authority of the Directors to disapply statutory preemption rights in relation to allotments of Ordinary Shares for cash in certain circumstances.\n\nIn November 2022, the Pre-Emption Group published a revised Statement of Principles, which increased the guideline threshold for the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights authorities from 10% to 20% of a company's issued share capital, with some additional /flexibility for follow-on offers of up to a maximum of an additional 4% of a company's issued share capital in speci/fied circumstances. Having considered the matter, the Board has decided to seek authority under Resolution 8 for the disapplication of pre-emption rights up to a maximum of 10% of the Company's issued share capital and will keep this under review in future years. This proposal is in line with the authorities received by the Company in prior years. The 10% limit includes any Treasury Shares reissued by the Company while the authority in Resolution 8 remains operable.\n\n## Transactions in Own Shares\n\nUnder the share buyback programme, a total of 29,755,861 Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 3.96% of the Company's issued share capital, were repurchased during 2022, at an average price of $39.22 per share. 22,000,000 Ordinary Shares, equivalent to 2.92% of the Company's issued share capital were cancelled on 22 December 2022 as part of the Group's management of its Treasury Share requirements.\n\nAs at 1 March 2023, 9,819,256 shares were held as Treasury Shares, equivalent to 1.32% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (excluding Treasury Shares). The Treasury Share balance at 31 December 2022 was 7,398,112, equivalent to 0.98% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (2021: 3,476,859 (0.5%)).\n\nDuring 2022, 3,834,608 (2021: 3,439,904) Treasury Shares were reissued under the Group's employee share schemes.\n\nA special resolution will be proposed at the 2023 AGM (resolution 9) to renew the authority of the Company, or any of its subsidiaries, to purchase up to 10% of the Company's Ordinary Shares in issue at the date of the AGM.\n\nIf approved, the minimum price which may be paid for shares purchased by the Company shall not be less than the nominal value of the shares and the maximum price will be 105% of the higher of the last independent trade in the Company's shares (or current independent bid, if higher) and the average market price of such shares over the preceding /five days. A special resolution will also be proposed for the purpose of renewing the authority to set the maximum and minimum prices at which Treasury Shares (effectively shares purchased and not cancelled) may be reissued off-market by the Company. If granted, both of these authorities will expire on the earlier of the date of the AGM in 2024 or 26 July 2024. As at 1 March 2023, options to subscribe for a total of 1,132,656 Ordinary Shares are outstanding, representing 0.15% of the issued Ordinary Share capital (excluding Treasury Shares). If the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares was used in full, the options would represent 0.17% of the remaining shares in issue.\n\nAs outlined on page 65, during 2022 the Group returned a further $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders under its share buyback programme. A further buyback tranche of $300 million is underway and is scheduled to complete by 30 March 2023.\n\nThe Board believes that the Company should retain the ability to buyback its own shares so that it can be used in the best interests of shareholders generally.\n\n## Events after the Balance Sheet Date\n\nDetails of post-Balance Sheet events are outlined in the Accounting Policies and notes 2 and 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 181, 193 and 241 respectively.",

These risks and uncertainties re/flect the international scope of the Group's operations and the Group's decentralised structure. The risks and uncertainties presented below are reviewed on an\n\n## Principal Strategic Risks and Uncertainties\n\n## Industry Cyclicality and Economic Conditions\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nConstruction activity, and therefore demand for the Group's products, is inherently cyclical and in/fluenced by multiple factors, including global and national economic circumstances (particularly those affecting the infrastructure and construction markets), monetary policy, consumer sentiment, swings in fuel and other input costs, and weather conditions that may disrupt outdoor construction activity.\n\nIn general, economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in construction activity leading to postponement of orders, and rising interest rates typically adversely impact construction activity and demand for building materials and services. The Group may also be adversely impacted by /fluctuations in the price of fuel and principal energy-related raw materials such as bitumen and steel (which accounted for approximately 13% of annual Group sales revenues in 2022 (10% in 2021)), and monetary and public policies in the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nThere is no guarantee that any future actions taken by Group management will be effective in managing these risks and maintaining /financial performance in the face of current changes in economic conditions. In addition, there is no guarantee that the Group will continue to be able to absorb the in/flationary pressures we are currently facing across fuel, energy, labour and transport, among other inputs, in many of our major markets. Failure to manage the above factors could have a material adverse effect on the Group's operating results and the market price of CRH plc's Ordinary Shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People Management\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe Group may not achieve its strategic objectives if it is not successful in attracting, engaging, retaining and developing employees, planning for leadership succession, developing a diverse and inclusive workforce, and building constructive relationships with collective representation groups.\n\nThe identi/fication and subsequent assessment, management, development and deployment of talented individuals is of major importance in continuing to deliver on the Group's strategy and in ensuring that succession planning objectives for key executive roles throughout its international operations are satis/fied. As well as ensuring the Group identi/fies, hires, integrates, engages, develops and promotes talent, the Group must attract and retain a diverse workforce and maintain an inclusive working environment.\n\nThe Group operates in a labour-intensive industry and can face frontline labour shortages that impact the Group's ability to produce goods, operate facilities and install products. Additionally, any signi/ficant loss of employee resources for a sustained period of time due to sickness or a public health emergency could impact the Group's ability to maintain operations.\n\nThe Group must also maintain constructive relationships with the trade/labour unions that represent certain employees under collective agreements. Failure to do so could mean that the Group cannot renegotiate on appropriate terms the relevant collective agreements upon expiration or may face strikes or work stoppages. Poor labour relations could create reputational risk for the Group and impact operational continuity, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and /financial condition of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Global I&D Council, chaired by our Chief Executive, with I&D Committees at a Division and corporate levels, and local I&D plans and/or ERGs across many operating companies\n- \u00b7 Talent management programmes (e.g. succession planning, I&D leadership development programme etc.) are deployed across our operating companies, with oversight and support from Group Human Resources\n- \u00b7 Development interventions are in place including enterprise-wide leadership development training\n- \u00b7 Positive employee and trade/labour union relations are maintained\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Established a formal mentorship programme for our top talent and speci/fic programmes targeting our early in career talent\n- \u00b7 Continued roll out of our Front Line Leadership programme across all operating companies\n- \u00b7 More than 250 of our most senior leaders participated in a sixmonth training programme on inclusive leadership development to ensure that they have the capability to build inclusive working environments\n- \u00b7 Market diversi/fication strategies, in addition to the Group's multiple end-use sectors\n- \u00b7 Constant focus on cost control, use of hedging instruments to control input increases, strong cash generation and disciplined /financial management\n- \u00b7 Disciplined and focused approach to capital allocation and reallocation to ensure our capital is deployed to where we see optimum opportunity for growth\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Strong commercial management and disciplined cost control has enabled the Group to maintain robust performance amid signi/ficant in/flationary pressures\n- \u00b7 The continued execution of the Group's integrated and sustainable solutions strategy has enabled the Group to offer a differentiated value-adding strategy\n- \u00b7 The solutions strategy has also created a more resilient business which, due to the sector breadth of our customer base, is more agile and /flexible and less exposed to cyclical economic activity\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\nannual basis and represent the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group at the time of compilation of the 2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F.

        "page_content": "## Commodity Products and Substitution\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nMany of the Group's products are commodities that face strong volume and price competition. Such products may also face competition from substitute products, including new products, that the Group does not produce. The Group must maintain strong customer relationships to ensure it can respond to changing consumer preferences and approaches to construction. Failure to differentiate and innovate could lead to market share decline, thus adversely impacting /financial performance.\n\nThe Group operates in a competitive environment in which pricing is impacted by macroeconomic conditions, the number of competitors, the degree of utilisation of production capacity and the speci/fics of product demand, among other factors. The Group's local competitors are increasingly innovative and cost competitive. The Group experiences downward pricing pressure from time to time across its different markets, and the Group may not always be able to raise prices to offset increased operating expenses and in/flationary pressures. The Group's pro/fits are particularly sensitive to changes in volume, as the cement business is capital-intensive and thus has signi/ficant /fixed and semi/fixed costs.\n\nMany Group products compete with building products that the Group does not produce. Any signi/ficant shift in demand preference to these alternate products could adversely impact market share and results of operations.\n\nIf the Group falls behind its competitors in developing new products which respond to customer needs, such as innovative, sustainable products, demand for the Group's products might decline, which could impact our /financial performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Portfolio Management\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe Group engages in acquisition and divestment activity as part of active portfolio management which presents risks around due diligence, execution and integration of assets. Additionally, the Group may be liable for liabilities of companies it has acquired or divested. Failure to ef/ficiently identify and execute deals may limit the Group's growth potential and impact /financial performance.\n\nThe Group's acquisition strategy depends on successfully identifying and acquiring suitable assets at prices that satisfy our stringent cash /flow and return on investment criteria. The Group may not be able to identify such companies, and, even if identi/fied, may not be able to acquire them because of a variety of factors including the outcome of due diligence processes, the ability to raise required funds on acceptable terms, regulatory approvals (including in certain instances from competition authorities) and competition for transactions from peers and other entities acquiring companies in the building materials sector. In addition, situations may arise where the Group may be liable for the past acts, omissions or liabilities of acquired companies, or may remain liable in cases of divestment; for example, the potential environmental liabilities addressed under the Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility risk on page 144.\n\nIn addition, the Group's ability to realise the expected bene/fits from acquisitions depends in part on its ability to integrate newly-acquired businesses. If the Group fails to integrate acquisitions, it may not achieve expected growth synergies or other /financial and operating bene/fits, and it may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect its operating results or /financial position or could otherwise harm its business. Further, integrating an acquired business, product or technology could divert management time and resources from other matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Expertise in identifying and evaluating targets, conducting due diligence (supported by external specialists when necessary) and executing integration.

The allocation of government funding for public infrastructure programmes is a key driver for our markets, such as the infrastructure and utilities elements of the Build Back America bill in the US. However, government budget de/ficits might reduce government infrastructure investment and reduce demand for the Group's products. Similarly, any signi/ficant change in investment strategy by policy makers in any of the Group's key markets could reduce market demand, adversely impacting /financial performance.\n\nThe Group currently operates mainly in Europe and North America, as well as, to a lesser extent, in less developed emerging markets in Eastern Europe, the Philippines and China. The economies of these countries are at varying stages of development, which could present multiple risks and uncertainties, including:\n\n- \u00b7  Changes in political, social or economic conditions;\n- \u00b7  New or strengthened trade protection measures, currency controls or import or export licensing requirements;\n- \u00b7  Political unrest and currency shocks;\n- \u00b7  Activism and civil disturbance, triggered by natural disasters, terrorist events or outbreak of armed con/flict, among other potential causes;\n- \u00b7  Labour and procurement practices which contravene ethical considerations and regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7  Unexpected changes in regulatory and tax requirements; and\n- \u00b7  Lockdowns or other restrictions due to public health emergencies, such as pandemics\n\nIn addition, CRH has people and assets in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. The ongoing geopolitical con/flict in Ukraine poses potential physical risks to our people and operations and continues to create economic uncertainty. The Board is actively monitoring the situation in Ukraine, with the priority being the safety and security of our people.\n\nRisk trend:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic Mineral Reserves\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nAppropriate reserves are increasingly scarce, and licences and permits required for operations are becoming harder to secure. Numerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating reserves and projecting production rates of the minerals used in the Group's products. Failure of the Group to plan for reserve depletion and secure or maintain permits may result in operation stoppages, adversely impacting /financial performance.\n\nContinuity of the cash /flows derived from the production and sale of building materials depends on satisfactory reserves planning, including appropriate long-term arrangements for their replacement. The Group cannot guarantee its ability to secure new reserves and plan for reserve depletion.\n\nIn addition, the Group may not be able to obtain the required licences and permits for its mining operations, and cannot guarantee that it will continue to satisfy the many terms and conditions under which such licences and permits are granted.\n\nThe failure to plan adequately for current and future extraction and utilisation or to ensure ongoing compliance with requirements of issuing authorities could lead to operational disruptions and negatively affect our /financial results.\n\nFor additional information on the Group's reserve position, see pages 262 to 267.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Planning for reserves enlargement and security of permits is a key focus area for our businesses\n- \u00b7 Robust mine planning to maximise the lifetime of permitted reserves under the Group's control\n- \u00b7 Implementation of operational best practices ensure mineral extraction in line with permit requirements, while minimising the impact of our operations on local environments\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 The updating of existing plans and the development of new mine plans progressed further in 2022, with formalised mine plans projected to increase from 49% to 64% of our cement raw material sites. A similar effort and increase is planned for 2023\n- \u00b7 A programme to upskill internal CRH personnel and provide them with specialised mine planning software was further rolled out in 2022\n- \u00b7 Exploration drilling and updating of block models continues, with a focus on increasing raw material reserves at key sites\n- \u00b7 Mitigation strategies to protect CRH's people and assets are in place in high-risk areas\n- \u00b7 Senior management and Board monitoring of economic indicators and commentaries\n- \u00b7 Two-phase budgeting process with prevailing economic and market forecasts factored in\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 As the con/flict in Ukraine escalated, following Russia's invasion in February 2022, the primary focus of the Group was on the health and safety of our people.

        "page_content": "## Principal Operational Risks and Uncertainties\n\n## Climate Change and Policy\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe impact of climate change may adversely affect the Group's operations and cost base and the stability of markets in which the Group operates. Risks related to climate change that could affect the Group's operations and /financial performance include both physical risks (such as acute and chronic changes in weather) and transitional risks (such as technological development, policy and regulation change and market and economic responses).\n\n## Physical Risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Acute: A once-off weather event, such as a hurricane or /flooding. An increase in these types of events may disrupt CRH's production rates as facilities are damaged or closed; and\n- \u00b7 Chronic: Sustained weather events, such as increased precipitation which may lead to higher sea levels. An increase in these types of events can disrupt CRH's supply chain and transport logistics\n\nThese physical risks may reduce product revenues and increase costs of maintaining the integrity of facilities. Operational productivity and demand for the Group's products may be reduced during these weather events leading to reduced /financial performance.\n\n## Transition Risks include:\n\n- \u00b7 Technology: The failure to keep up with the pace of technological change may lead to increased operational costs and /financial loss through the inability to supply products to customers who require innovative and low-carbon sustainable solutions. Failure to leverage innovation and other sustainability initiatives, for example transitioning to innovative lower-carbon products such as lower-carbon cements, recycled asphalt pavement (RAP), permeable paving solutions and other high-performance sustainability solutions, may shorten product life cycles or give rise to early product obsolescence thus impairing /financial performance and/or future value creation;\n- \u00b7 Legal and Regulatory: Changes to climate-related laws or regulation could increase risks and costs related to compliance and litigation related to CRH's operations. Efforts to address climate change through laws and regulations, for example by requiring reductions in emissions of GHGs such as CO 2 and additional disclosures of GHG emissions among other changes can create economic risks and uncertainties for the Group's businesses. Such risks could include the cost of purchasing allowances or credits to meet GHG emissions caps, the cost of installing equipment to reduce emissions to comply with GHG limits and higher direct and indirect costs from the imposition of legislative or regulatory controls;\n- \u00b7 Reputation: The building materials industry is, by its nature, energy intensive and stakeholder expectations with regard to climate change continue to increase. Failing to reduce emissions arising from our operations or failing to meet investor expectations with regard to emissions reductions may adversely impact the Group's reputation; and\n- \u00b7 Market: Continued focus on climate change by investors and lenders may affect their preferences and sentiments, which could affect the Group's access to capital markets, cost of capital, and potential investors, each of which could potentially increase the Group's /financing costs and affect its /financial performance. In terms of operating markets, failure to transition to lower-carbon products could result in early product obsolescence thus impairing /financial performance and/or future value creation\n\nThe Group continues to be exposed to costs related to carbon emissions trading schemes. While these costs do not currently have a material /financial impact, there can be no assurance that more extensive carbon cost mechanisms will not be introduced that could potentially impact the Group's /financial performance. Further, although the Group continues to engage with stakeholders to fully understand their expectations in relation to climate change, such expectations continue to evolve rapidly and the Group cannot guarantee that all stakeholders' expectations will continue to be met. Please refer to page 150 to 156 for further details.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is working towards delivery of its ambition to become a net-zero business by 2050, with an industry leading target of a 30% reduction in absolute carbon emissions by 2030 (on a 2021 base year)\n- \u00b7 Operational improvements at plants, such as the use of alternative fuels that reduce CO 2 emissions, deliver /financial ef/ficiencies and support the circular economy\n- \u00b7 Acquisitions are assessed through our ESG due diligence processes to identify potential risks and upon acquiring are incorporated into our ERM processes\n- \u00b7 The Group publishes an annual independently-assured Sustainability Report, which is available on www.crh.com\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Our Scope 1 and 2 absolute carbon emissions decreased by 7% in 2022 as we execute against the levers in our decarbonisation roadmap and lower clinker production\n- \u00b7 We also saw an improvement in our cement speci/fic net CO 2 emissions per tonne of cementitious product which reduced to 566kg (from 586kg in 2021)\n- \u00b7 Continued progress towards our 2025 target of 50% of product revenue from products with enhanced sustainability attributes, which was 47% of product revenue in 2022",

Security incidents and cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and our systems for protecting our assets and data against cyber security risks may be insuf/ficient. Security breaches, IT interruptions or data loss could result in signi/ficant business disruption, loss of production, reputational damage and/or regulatory penalties.\n\nThe Group collects, processes, and retains potentially sensitive and con/fidential information about our customers, suppliers, employees and business performance, and has been subject to cyber security attacks. Despite the security measures we have in place, and those of third party suppliers and vendors with which we do business, attacks or other signi/ficant IT interruptions or errors may result in interference with production software, corruption or theft of sensitive customer or employee data, manipulation of /financial data and/or reputational losses.\n\nIn addition, as cyber security threats evolve, the Group may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protection measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. The Group likewise may incur signi/ficant remediation costs following any major cyber security incident.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and Safety Performance\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe Group's businesses operate in an industry with inherent health and safety risks, including operation of heavy vehicles, working at height, and use of mechanised processes. Failure to ensure safe workplaces could result in a deterioration in the Group's safety performance and related adverse regulatory action or legal liability. Health and safety incidents could signi/ficantly impact the Group's operational and /financial performance, as well as its reputation.\n\nThe Group's safety risks extend to sites not wholly within our control, including outdoor paving and construction sites. This environment presents a complex challenge which requires safe behaviours and engagement from employees as well as robust Group policies and procedures. A high number of accidents may pose additional challenges in recruiting new employees, ensuring operational continuity and maintaining licences and permits.\n\nFurther, the Group is subject to a broad and stringent range of existing and evolving laws, regulations, standards and best practices with respect to health and safety in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Should the Group's health and safety frameworks, processes and controls fail to comply with such regulations, the Group could be exposed to signi/ficant potential legal liabilities and penalties.\n\nIn addition, potential health and safety issues with products could lead to welfare and security issues for our broad range of stakeholders including our employees, contractors, customers and communities.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present additional health and safety challenges due to potential transmission of the virus and changes to traditional operating norms. There is no guarantee that efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission will be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19 or other viral infections at our sites and locations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 A robust health and safety framework is implemented throughout the Group's operations requiring all employees to complete formal health and safety training on a regular basis.

Failure to embed sustainability principles within the Group's businesses and strategy may result in non-compliance with relevant regulations, standards and best practices and lead to adverse stakeholder sentiment and reduced /financial performance.\n\nCustomers are increasingly demanding sustainable products, particularly products with reduced lifetime carbon emissions. If the Group fails to offer products with improved sustainability performance, demand for the Group's products may fall and the Group will experience a deterioration in /financial performance. Failing to leverage innovation and other sustainability initiatives may also shorten product life cycles or give rise to early product obsolescence thus impairing /financial performance and/or future value creation.\n\nThe Group is also subject to a broad and increasingly stringent range of laws, regulations, standards and best practices with respect to ESG performance, including new regulations related to climate change and pollution. As a result of this new regulatory environment, the Group faces rising compliance costs, potential new legal liability exposure and could be subject to an obligation to adapt certain of its current operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supply Chain Continuity\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe Group must reliably and economically source various raw materials, equipment and other inputs from various third-party suppliers and then transport /finished products to satisfy customer demands and meet contractual requirements. Our ability to balance maintaining resilient supply chains with optimising our working capital and inventory levels is critical to the continuity and strong /financial returns of our operations. Failure to manage any material disruption in our supply chains could adversely impact our ability to service our customers and result in a deterioration in operational and/or /financial performance.\n\nLike many other industries, the global building materials industry has been adversely impacted by disruptions and threats to supply chains caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequently the con/flict in Ukraine. Additionally, the in/flationary environment within the Group's major markets has resulted in increased cost and reduced availability of some key inputs and transportation.\n\nSome of the raw materials, equipment, transport and other inputs that the Group requires are limited to a small number of suppliers from which the Group can economically and/or practically source, which often have long lead times. Any of our suppliers may experience temporary, prolonged or even permanent operational disruption, which could have an adverse impact on the Group's operations, /financial performance and reputation. In addition, in certain markets in which the Group operates, including markets for steel, cement, bitumen and supplementary cementitious materials, contracted market demand can far outstrip supply, which may restrict the Group's ability to obtain alternative suppliers or additional volumes where necessary. Our focus on responsible sourcing practices and other ESG considerations may also limit the pool of acceptable suppliers from which we may choose to source.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Source from and build close relationships/partnerships with established, reputable suppliers, maintaining regular communication on potential supply chain challenges\n- \u00b7 Wide range of supplier risk management practices, which enable CRH to identify and manage critical supply chain challenges\n- \u00b7 Risk scenarios on potential risks to CRH's supply chain and strategies to alleviate these risks, if they occur\n- \u00b7 Robust demand forecasting to ensure appropriate inventory levels are maintained\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 Creation of a central team focused on procurement risk and market intelligence to build strategies for managing supply chain risks and implementing these strategies across global supply chains and local operations\n- \u00b7 A procurement response team was formed to minimise any disruption to our operations associated with the con/flict in Ukraine, with global category teams working closely with local teams, and a renewed focus on innovative solutions\n- \u00b7 CRH's strategy and business model are built around sustainable, responsible and ethical performance.

In addition, various assumptions are made in the computation of the overall tax charge and in balance sheet provisions which may need to be adjusted over time. Changes in tax regimes or assessment of additional tax liabilities in future tax audits could result in incremental tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on cash /flows and the /financial results of operations.\n\nThe Group's income tax charge is based on reported pro/fits and statutory tax rates, which re/flect various allowances and reliefs and tax ef/ficiencies available to the Group in the multiple tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of the Group's provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition of deferred tax assets also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. In addition, the Group is subject to tax audits which can involve complex issues that could require extended periods to conclude, the resolution of which is often not within its control. Although management believes that the estimates included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group's tax return positions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the /final outcome of these matters will equal the estimates re/flected in the Group's historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n\nAs a multinational corporation, the Group is subject to various taxes in all jurisdictions in which it operates. Economic and political conditions, tax rates and the interpretation of tax rules in these jurisdictions may be subject to signi/ficant change, particularly during periods of administrative change or /fiscal de/ficit. For example, the introduction of a Global Minimum Tax as developed by the OECD could result in increased tax liabilities in respect of some jurisdictions. In addition, the Group's future effective income tax rate could be affected (positively or negatively) by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\n\nFinally, changes to international tax principles, for example at an EU level, could adversely affect the Group's effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. If the Group's effective income tax rate was to increase, its cash /flows and the /financial results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Tax Policy, supporting Tax Guidelines and SOX controls provide a tax governance framework operable throughout the Group\n- \u00b7 Group Tax is managed by a team of in-house specialists with signi/ficant experience.

        "page_content": "Overview\n\nStrategy Report\n\nBusiness Performance & Segmental Reviews\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe Group uses /financial instruments throughout its businesses giving rise to interest rate and leverage, foreign currency, counterparty, credit rating and liquidity risks. A downgrade of the Group's credit ratings may give rise to increases in future funding costs and may impair the Group's ability to raise funds on acceptable terms. In addition, insolvency of the /financial institutions with which the Group conducts business may adversely impact the Group's /financial position.\n\nInterest rate and leverage risks: As at 31 December 2022, the Group had outstanding gross indebtedness, including leases, of approximately $11.0 billion (2021: $12.0 billion) and cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.9 billion (2021: $5.8 billion). The Group uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its /fixed rate debt to /floating rate. While current leverage is low, acquisition activity could adversely impact operating and /financial /flexibility as well as /financial position. There can be no assurance that the Group will not be adversely impacted by increases in borrowing costs in the future. During 2021, the Group transitioned from some IBOR backed rates linked to its main banking facilities to alternative benchmark rates. These alternative benchmark rates are backward looking meaning the related interest charges would not be fully known until close to the end of the interest period. This transition process will continue until June 2023 after which US dollar IBOR rates will cease to be available.\n\nForeign currency risks: If the Group's reporting currency weakens relative to the basket of foreign currencies in which net debt is denominated (including the euro, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Polish Zloty, Philippine Peso and Pound Sterling), the net debt balance would increase; the converse would apply if the Group's reporting currency was to strengthen. Where economically feasible, net debt is maintained in the same relative ratio as capital employed to act as an economic hedge of the underlying currency assets.\n\nCounterparty risks: Insolvency of the /financial institutions with which the Group conducts business or a downgrade in their credit ratings may lead to losses in the cash balances that the Group holds with such /financial institutions or losses in derivative transactions that the Group has entered into with these parties and may render it more dif/ficult for the Group to utilise existing debt capacity or otherwise obtain /financing for operations. The Group holds signi/ficant cash and cash equivalents on deposit and derivative transactions with a variety of highly rated /financial institutions which at 31 December 2022, totalled $5.9 billion (2021: $5.8 billion) and $(86) million (2021: $122 million) respectively. In addition, certain of the Group's activities give rise to signi/ficant amounts receivable from counterparties at the balance sheet date; at 31 December 2022, this balance was $3.9 billion (2021: $4.0 billion).\n\nCredit rating risks: A downgrade of the Group's credit ratings may give rise to increases in funding costs in respect of future debt and may, among other concerns, impair its ability to access debt markets or otherwise raise funds or enter into lines of credit, for example, on acceptable terms. Such a downgrade may result from factors speci/fic to the Group, including increased indebtedness stemming from acquisition activity, or from other factors such as general economic or sector speci/fic weakness or sovereign credit rating ceilings.\n\nLiquidity risks: The principal liquidity risks stem from the maturation of debt obligations and derivative transactions. The Group aims to achieve /flexibility in funding sources through a variety of means including (i) maintaining cash and cash equivalents with a number of highly rated counterparties; (ii) meeting the bulk of debt requirements through debt capital markets or other term /financing; (iii) limiting the annual maturity of such balances; and (iv) having surplus committed bank lines of credit. However, market or economic conditions may make it dif/ficult at times to realise this objective.\n\nFor additional information on the above risks see note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 225 to 228.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The Group seeks to ensure that suf/ficient resources are available to meet the Group's liabilities as they fall due through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, cash /flows and undrawn committed bank facilities.

While a non-cash item, a material write-down of goodwill could have a substantial impact on the Group's income and equity.\n\nUnder IFRS, goodwill and inde/finite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing. A detailed discussion of the impairment testing process, the key assumptions used, the results of that testing and the related sensitivity analysis is contained in note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 210 to 212.\n\nWhile a goodwill impairment charge does not impact cash /flow, a full write-down at 31 December 2022 would have resulted in a charge to income and a reduction in equity of $9.2 billion (2021: $9.5 billion).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\n## Description\n\n## How We Manage the Risk\n\nThe principal foreign exchange risks to which the Consolidated Financial Statements are exposed pertain to (i) adverse movements in reported results when translated into the reporting currency; and (ii) declines in the reporting currency value of net investments which are denominated in a wide basket of currencies other than the reporting currency. Adverse changes in the exchange rates could negatively affect retained earnings.\n\nGiven the geographic diversity of the Group, a signi/ficant proportion of its revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the Group's reporting currency, including the euro, Canadian Dollar, Swiss Franc, Polish Zloty, Philippine Peso and Pound Sterling. From year to year, adverse changes in the exchange rates used to translate these and other foreign currencies into the reporting currency have impacted and will continue to impact consolidated results and net worth.\n\nFor additional information on the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022, see the Business Performance and Segmental Reviews section commencing on page 61 and note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 225 to 228.\n\nRisk trend:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 The Group changed to US Dollar reporting currency effective 1 January 2020, in consideration of the current portfolio and business mix which has a signi/ficant US Dollar exposure\n- \u00b7 The Group's established policy is to spread its net worth across the currencies of the various operations with the objective of limiting its exposure to individual currencies and thus promoting consistency with the geographical balance of its operation\n- \u00b7 The Group's activities are conducted primarily in the local currency of operation, resulting in low levels of foreign currency transactional risk\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 The value of the US Dollar has strengthened relative to most of the other functional currencies that CRH operates in, resulting in a currency loss being reported through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (this is an accounting loss rather than a cash /flow loss)\n- \u00b7 The Group continues to monitor its currency spread of net debt to ensure that it re/flects the currency spread of capital employed and thus acts as a natural hedge and minimises the overall net currency risk\n- \u00b7 Economic indicators of goodwill impairment are monitored closely through the monthly reporting process. Detailed impairment testing is undertaken prior to year end\n- \u00b7 The goodwill impairment assessment is subject to regular review by the Audit Committee\n- \u00b7 For further information on how the Group manages the risk posed by goodwill impairment and the results of the 2022 impairment testing process, please refer to note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 210 to 212\n\n## Developments During 2022\n\n- \u00b7 We recon/firmed the appropriateness of goodwill testing levels\n- \u00b7 We reviewed and revised discount rates to ensure continued inclusion of appropriate levels of risk\n- \u00b7 We extended procedures performed with respect to climate change risk.

        "page_content": "## Focus on Climate Risks and Opportunities\n\nCRH's ERM framework supports risk identi/fication, assessment and reporting activities across the Group; the below information is an example of how our ERM framework was applied to manage our climate risk.\n\n## Identi/fication\n\nAs part of our continued commitment to understanding the potential climate-related risks and opportunities that CRH faces, during 2022 we undertook a number of risk workshops focused on where climate-related risks could adversely impact the Group, and where we see potential opportunities for CRH to create value and contribute to the development of a more resilient built environment and a more sustainable future.\n\nThese sessions involved bringing senior leaders from across our business together to discuss, challenge and prioritise what participants believed to be the most material climate risks and opportunities the Group may face. Our sessions were facilitated by the Group Risk team with the support of other corporate functions who challenged the perceptions and opinions of the participants to ensure a robust discussion.\n\n## Assessment\n\nWhile our traditional ERM process assesses risks over our strategic planning horizon, with longer-term risks being embedded into our emerging risk categories, the longer-term horizons over which we assessed the Group's climate risks and opportunities necessitated rede/fining our time horizons to take a longer-term view. The climate risk and opportunity assessment process de/fined the business-relevant time horizons as:\n\nShort-term: The risks, opportunities and actions reasonably foreseeable up to 2025 (3-year window) and for which business planning has the highest degree of visibility.\n\nMedium-term: The period between 2025 and 2030 which represents the period up to our publicly disclosed group-wide target of reducing our absolute emissions by 30% by 2030 and a transitional period between current planning and the longer-term strategic goals for the Group.\n\nLong-term: The 2030 to 2050 period where transitioning to net-zero is fully embedded in the business structure and performance with climate driven solutions at the forefront of value creation.\n\nOur bottom-up analysis of risks and opportunities was complemented, and expanded upon, by feedback from stakeholders and expert advisors. The exercise included assessing emerging best practice in TCFD disclosures to ensure we provide a comprehensive and transparent disclosure. The Sustainability, Risk and Finance teams have created an extensive library of potential and wide-ranging climate-related risk impacts and their signi/ficance. As part of each workshop, these issues were categorised on a /five-point scale from negligible to severe. Where one or more of the risk criteria were met our method categorises the risk in the higher impact band.\n\nGiven the nature of climate change, it is viewed as both a current principal risk and an emerging risk for CRH. Some climate risks are near-term and acute and are treated as current enterprise risks, whereas other risks and challenges are longer-term and potentially enduring if left unmanaged and would be seen as emerging risks. Similarly, some opportunities are available now and in the near-term whereas others require facilitating action such as policy change or physical infrastructure to fully realise the bene/fits over the longer-term.\n\n## Management\n\nEvery individual in CRH is responsible for managing risk and a core value in CRH is accountability. Every risk across the Group is assigned a risk owner who is responsible for ensuring that appropriate attention is directed towards that risk whether through current mitigation or future planning. Not all risks can be managed at the point of identi/fication and as such the risk owner is responsible for the implementation of mitigation strategies that could be enacted should a risk materialise. Common risk criteria and topic hierarchies are used to assess and consistently categorise risks and opportunities, which helps identify and manage aggregate exposures that may be managed centrally more effectively. The size and signi/ficance of each risk is determined according to the product of its assessed impact on the organisation and its likelihood of occurrence, with consideration of factors such as impact velocity, for example, informing the prioritisation of risks for subsequent management to within agreed acceptable levels.\n\nIn order to highlight the Group's commitment towards managing our climate risks, from 2022, a portion of the Group's Performance Share Plan is directly linked to speci/fic actions related to managing climate change and the achievement of certain climate-related targets, such as delivery of our carbon emissions reduction target and embedding sustainability into relevant operating companies.\n\n## Monitoring and Reporting\n\nAll risks identi/fied in CRH are recorded in the Group's RMIS which facilitates the effective allocation of responsibility, tracking of risk performance and monitoring of mitigation activities. Our RMIS is integrated across the Group and enables the ef/ficient reporting of risks through our bottom-up process, from operations up to the Board. Risks are reported to the Risk Committee from all divisions and functions on a rotational basis ensuring that all risks are presented, discussed and challenged in an appropriate forum.\n\nThe Risk Committee sets the Group's risk strategy and oversees the Group's risk governance model and how the Group identi/fies, assesses and manages the principal and emerging risks the Group encounters in pursuit of its strategic objectives. Additionally, climate-related risks and opportunities are reported to our Climate Action Council, which reports to the Chief Operating Of/ficer, and is responsible for considering and developing climate strategies for consideration by the Global Leadership Team and Board and for ensuring that they are fully embedded in the Group's corporate priorities. For further information on risk governance structures, please see pages 94 and 95.\n\nThe outputs of our climate-related workshops are included as part of our climate scenario analysis disclosure on page 156 and inform our strategy and risk planning going forward.",

The Group also tested its strategic resilience to climate change. We anticipate that in future Annual Reports we will further re/fine our approach to quantitative assessments and expand this analysis to other material risks and opportunities.\n\n## Scenario selection\n\nFor the modelling of transitional risks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the Network for Greening of the Financial System (NGFS) were chosen due to their close alignment with the TCFD's recommendations. For the modelling of physical risks, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was chosen. Their Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are the common framework for physical scenarios and are recommended by the TCFD. In line with the TCFD's recommendations, information on scenario selections can be seen in Table 49 below, which provides some context on the Group's modelling results.\n\nIn 2022, as new scienti/fic evidence was released by the IPCC and the SBTi released its 1.5\u00b0C guidance for the cement sector, we extended our scenario analyses to assess the impacts of a 1.5\u00b0C temperature increase above pre-industrial levels (by 2100) on our business in 2030 and 2050.\n\n| Warming Pathway   | Transition Scenarios             | Transition Scenarios                 | Physical Scenarios                                      |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n|                   | IEA WEO                          | NGFS                                 | IPCC                                                    |\n| 1.5 o C           | Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) | Orderly; Disorderly                  | N/A                                                     |\n| < 2.0 o C         | Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) | Orderly; Disorderly                  | RCP 2.6 (combined with Shared  Socioeconomic Pathway 1) |\n| 3-4 o C           | Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) | Current Policies ('Hot house world') | RCP 8.5 (combined with Shared  Socioeconomic Pathway 5) |\n\n## Approach to detailed quantitative scenario assessments\n\nThe quantitative scenario analysis of the risks and opportunities were completed for two material risks of Carbon Pricing and Adverse Weather. We used IEA-sector and scenario-level data to frame the analysis as well as other datasets including internally generated data.\n\nThe scenario analysis for both risks involved a third-party specialist, platform and external data sets for risk analysis.

We have qualitatively described the output from this process above and found that the probability of adverse weather events occurring is high, while the risk from carbon pricing increasing is high under some scenarios. However, we already have a plan and targets in place and we are on track to mitigate against these impacts and decarbonise our business, so the residual level of risk is at an acceptable level for our business strategy. We recognise the importance of understanding our risk and opportunity landscape in guiding CRH's climate strategy. Based on this assessment, the Group believes it has suf/ficient /flexibility and resilience to successfully manage its climate risks and opportunities.  As CRH continues to assess its strategy, new climate risks and opportunities may become apparent, which the Group may consider as part of its planning. CRH will further deepen its climate-related initiatives in the coming years to help ensure CRH plays a leading role in shaping a sustainable future.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n162",

The Group did not record an impairment charge during the year. The Group's evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the recoverable amount of goodwill  of each cash generating unit (CGU) to its carrying value. The Group used the value-in-use approach, which deploys a discounted cash  flow model to estimate the recoverable amount. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to  discount rates, short-term forecasts and long-term growth rates ('key assumptions'). Changes in these key assumptions could have a  significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. With the assistance of our valuation and sustainability specialists, we performed risk assessment procedures and performed  sensitivities on management's key assumptions, to identify certain CGUs of interest. We focused on CGUs where the recoverable   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | Our audit procedures related to the discount rates and short-term forecasts of sales growth and energy costs of the selected CGUs,   used by management to estimate the recoverable amount of the selected CGUs included the following, among others:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of relevant controls over management's determination of discount rates, and the short-term forecasts of revenues and energy costs used to determine the recoverable amount of the selected CGU.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | The Audit Committee discussion of this key audit matter is set out on page 97.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| How the scope of our  audit responded to the  key audit matter | \u00b7 assessing the valuation methodology compared to generally accepted valuation practices and accounting standards;

Revenue derived from long-term contracts in-progress at the balance sheet date involves judgement, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating revenue to be recognised, and total estimated costs of the contract.\n\nWe identified revenue recognition for certain long-term contracts in-progress at the balance sheet date ('certain long-term contracts') as a key audit matter because of the judgements made by management to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts in certain components whether due to bias or otherwise. This required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of certain long-term contracts and required a high degree of auditor judgement when performing audit procedures to audit management's estimates and evaluating the results of those procedures. We focused a proportion of our audit effort on a number of contracts where we consider there to be the highest degree of management judgement required and designed procedures to mitigate the associated risks.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this key audit matter is set out on page 97.\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's recognition of revenue for certain long-term contracts at the balance sheet date in certain components included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of relevant controls over long-term contract revenue, including management's controls over the estimates of total costs for performance obligations, and over the assessment of the recoverability of uncertified work in progress ('WIP') and aged debt.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of long-term contracts and:\n- \u00b7 assessed whether the contracts were properly included in management's calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation;\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the performance obligation to supporting documentation;\n- \u00b7 evaluated and challenged the estimates of total cost for the performance obligation by:\n- \u00b7 comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated, at either the inception of the contract or the start of the reporting period, to be incurred to date;\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's ability to accurately estimate the total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Group's project managers and engineers, and comparing the estimates to management's work plans, engineering specifications, and supplier contracts;\n- \u00b7 comparing management's estimates for the selected contracts to costs of similar performance obligations, when applicable; and\n- \u00b7 considering whether there were any indicators of bias in arriving at the Group's reported position\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy of WIP held on contracts at the balance sheet date by obtaining supporting documentation including customer agreement and subsequent certification and payment;\n- \u00b7 tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to estimate total costs accurately by comparing actual costs to management's historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\nBased on the procedures performed, we are satisfied that revenue recognised at the balance sheet date in respect of long-term contracts in-progress is appropriate and reasonable when assessed against our own independent expectations and our assessment of the accuracy of historical estimates against actual costs.\n\nOur audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n164",

This  resulted in us selecting profit before tax from continuing operations  as the most appropriate benchmark. | The Company holds the Group's investments and is not in  itself profit-oriented. The strength of the balance sheet is  the key measure of financial health that is important to  shareholders since the primary concern for the Company is  the payment of dividends.

Performance materiality was set at 80% of each of Group and Company materiality for the 2022 audit (2021: 80%). In determining the current year performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\n\n- a. The quality of the control environment and whether we were able to rely on controls,\n- b. the amount and nature of control deficiencies,\n- c. the nature, volume and size of misstatements (corrected and/or uncorrected) in the previous audit,\n- d. prior period adjustments or errors found in the current year,\n- e. our assessment of engagement risk.\n\n## Error reporting threshold\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them any audit differences in excess of $8.5 million (2021: $7 million), as well as differences below that threshold which, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## Identification and scoping of components\n\n- \u00b7 The Group consists of three operating and reporting segments; it has a decentralised structure and an international footprint. As a result, a significant portion of audit planning time was spent to ensure that the scope of our work is appropriate to address the Group's identified risks of material misstatement.\n- \u00b7 In-scope locations were identified based on their contribution to the applicable benchmarks i.e. revenue, total assets and profit before tax from continuing operations.\n- \u00b7 We focused our Group audit scope primarily on the audit of 3 components (5 components in 2021) which were subject to full scope integrated audit procedures performed by local audit teams to a component materiality (Scope A). 17 components (23 components in 2021) were subject to specified integrated audit procedures on prescribed balances and specific controls that have been performed by component teams or the Group audit team to component materiality (Scope B), and the remaining 15 (20 components in 2021) were subject to defined audit procedures consisting of focused risk assessments and analytical reviews performed centrally by the Group audit team (Scope C).\n- \u00b7 Data analytics were performed centrally and used extensively in selecting the components and addressing the residual entities based on the considerations listed. In addition, we analysed disaggregated financial data related to residual entities not subject to full or specified scope audit procedures in order to identify any unusual movements or relationships.\n- \u00b7 Our audit work for all components were executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component which were lower than Group materiality and ranged from $45 million to $120 million.\n\n## Working with other auditors\n\nThe Group audit team planned its site visits to component auditors based on a variety of factors including size of entity and number of significant risks. Oversight and guidance is provided to the component auditors through a combination of:\n\n- \u00b7 issuance of Group referral instructions;\n- \u00b7 upfront team briefings to all component teams;\n- \u00b7 site visits (physically, where possible and if not virtually); and\n- \u00b7 risk assessment discussions and detailed workpaper reviews.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n166",

In addition we assess the competence of our component auditors.\n\nA combination of physical, where possible, and virtual site visits were performed at key locations during the year.\n\nWe held regular meetings with management at a regional and Group level in order to update our understanding of the Group and its environment on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe classify components according to the following scoping categories:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1) Scope A - Full scope integrated audit procedures have been performed by local audit teams to a component materiality. These are financially significant to the Group and include risks relevant to the Group audit.\n- 2) Scope B - Specified integrated audit procedures on prescribed balances and specific controls have been performed by component teams or the Group audit team to component materiality. Scope B also contains Risks of Material Misstatements and associated procedures performed at Group level. The Scope B entities are not individually financially significant to the Group.\n- 3) Scope C - Defined audit procedures consisting of focused risk assessments and analytical reviews have been performed by the Group audit team. The Scope C entities are not individually financially significant to the Group.\n- 4) Residual - As Risks of Material Misstatements have been determined to be remote for components and balances included in the residual, the Group engagement team performs analytical procedures, which are not substantive in nature, to determine whether the audit risk has been reduced to an acceptable level.\n\n## Our consideration of the control environment\n\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting across all in-scope entities and entity level controls at the Group level. Given the importance of information technology (IT) to the recording of financial information and transactions, we have tested General IT controls relating to certain of the Group's IT systems where relevant to our audit work. We were able to place reliance on controls where planned and it was more efficient.\n\n## Our consideration of climate-related risks\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impacts of the climate-related risks identified by management on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set out their 2030 carbon reduction target on page 27. The Group have also identified climate change and policy as part of their principal operational risks and uncertainties on page 142. They have set out the potential impacts of their physical risks and transitional risks on their business on page 142 and their Taxonomy eligible economic activities on page 270.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have obtained management's climate-related risk assessment and made inquiries of management to understand their process for considering the impact of climate-related risks. The Group reflected the impact of stated 2030 carbon reduction target on assumptions used in setting key estimates recorded in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requirements.\n\nWe have performed our own risk assessment of the potential impact of the 2030 carbon reduction target outlined by the Group and how they may affect judgements and estimates included in the financial statements. The main climate-related implications considered as part of our audit relate to the impact of climate change on cash flow projections underlying intangible assets. These projections include assumptions on costs of carbon and future capital expenditure required to meet the 2030 carbon reduction target. Our audit procedures were performed with the involvement of our sustainability and valuation specialists. We also challenged how the directors considered climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability.\n\nWe assessed if the assumptions used by the directors in the financial statements were consistent with their 2030 carbon reduction target and as set out in their accounting policies, on pages 181 to 190. In early 2023, the Group adopted an updated target of a 30% reduction in CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 2030 compared to 2021 levels and we considered the directors' disclosure as set out on page 181.\n\nWe have also read the Group's disclosure of climate-related information in the front half of the annual report, including the TCFD disclosures listed on pages 56 to 59.",

The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the Annual Report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view and otherwise comply with the Companies Act 2014, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (Ireland) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on IAASA's website at:\n\n## https://iaasa.ie/publications/description-of-the-auditors-responsibilities-for-the-audit-of-the-financial-statements/\n\nThis description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the nature of the industry and sector, control environment and business performance including the design of the Group's remuneration policies, key drivers for directors' remuneration, bonus levels and performance targets;\n- \u00b7 the Group's own assessment of the risks that irregularities may occur either as a result of fraud or error that was approved by the board and presented to the Audit Committee on 14 February 2023;\n- \u00b7 results of our enquiries of management, internal audit and the audit committee about their own identification and assessment of the risks of irregularities;\n- \u00b7 any matters we identified having obtained and reviewed the Group's documentation of their policies and procedures relating to:\n- \u00b7 identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n- \u00b7 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- \u00b7 the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 the matters discussed among the audit engagement team including significant component audit teams and relevant internal specialists, including tax, valuations, pensions, IT, mineral reserves and sustainability specialists regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n168",

The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the Irish Companies Act 2014, the UK Listing Rules, the Euronext Dublin Listing Rules, the Market Abuse Regulation, the Irish Transparency Regulation, and reporting obligations under US securities laws. The Group is also subject to various statutes, regulations, and laws applicable to businesses generally in the countries and markets in which it operates.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the Group and Company's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These include statutes, regulations and laws affecting land usage, zoning, labour and employment practices, competition/anti -trust, financial reporting, taxation, anti-fraud and theft, anti -bribery, anti -corruption, international trade compliance, governance, data protection and data privacy and security, environmental, health and safety, and international trade and sanctions laws and other matters.\n\n## Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we identified 'Revenue recognition for certain in-progress long-term contracts' as a key audit matter related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matter in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to that key audit matter.\n\nIn addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims;\n- \u00b7 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud;\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with the tax authorities; and\n- \u00b7 in addressing the risk of fraud through management override of controls, testing the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments; assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias; and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\n\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2014\n\nBased solely on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, we report that:\n\n- \u00b7 We have obtained all the information and explanations which we consider necessary for the purposes of our audit.\n- \u00b7 In our opinion the accounting records of the Company were sufficient to permit the financial statements to be readily and properly audited.\n- \u00b7 In our opinion, information and returns adequate for our audit have been received from branches of the company not visited by us.\n- \u00b7 The Company Balance Sheet is in agreement with the accounting records.\n- \u00b7 In our opinion the information given in those parts of the directors' report as specified for our review is consistent with the financial statements and the directors' report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2014.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement required by the Companies Act 2014\n\nWe report, in relation to information given in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 88 to 107 that:\n\n- \u00b7 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the course of the audit, the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement pursuant to subsections 2(c) and (d) of section 1373 of the Companies Act 2014 is consistent with the Group's statutory financial statements in respect of the financial year concerned and such information has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2014. Based on our knowledge and understanding of the Group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified any material misstatements in this information.\n- \u00b7 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the course of the audit, the Corporate Governance Statement contains the information required by Regulation 6(2) of the European Union (Disclosure of Non-Financial and Diversity Information by certain large undertakings and groups) Regulations 2017; and\n- \u00b7 In our opinion, based on the work undertaken during the course of the audit, the information required pursuant to section 1373(2)(a),(b),(e) and (f) of the Companies Act 2014 is contained in the Corporate Governance Statement.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 1 March 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n172",

The Company did not record an impairment charge during the year.\n\nThe Company's evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the recoverable amount of goodwill of each cash generating unit (CGU) to its carrying value. The Company used the value-in-use approach, which deploys a discounted cash flow model to estimate the recoverable amount. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions relating to discount rates, short-term forecasts and long-term growth rates (\"key assumptions'). Changes in these key assumptions could have a significant impact on the recoverable amount, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.\n\nWith the assistance of our valuation and sustainability specialists, we performed risk assessment procedures and performed sensitivities on management's key assumptions, to identify certain CGUs of interest. We focused on CGUs where the recoverable amount did not exceed its carrying value by a significant amount and on CGUs which had a significant reduction in cash flow forecasts compared to prior year ('selected CGUs'). Within the selected CGUs we focused on those assumptions which were most sensitive based on the individual facts and circumstances, which we determined to be discount rates and short-term forecasts of sales growth and energy costs.\n\nWe determined that the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill of the selected CGUs was a critical audit matter because it required a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's key assumptions.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this critical audit matter is set out on page 97.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the discount rates and short-term forecasts of sales growth and energy costs of the selected CGUs, used by management to estimate the recoverable amount of the selected CGUs included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of relevant controls over management's determination of discount rates, and the short-term forecasts of revenues and energy costs used to determine the recoverable amount of the selected CGU.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology and discount rate for each selected CGU by:\n- \u00b7 assessing the valuation methodology compared to generally accepted valuation practices and accounting standards; and\n- \u00b7 developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n- \u00b7 We agreed the underlying cash flow forecasts to the Board approved projections and we evaluated management's ability to accurately forecast future revenues and energy costs by:\n- \u00b7 performing a look-back analysis and comparing actual results to management's historical forecasts;\n- \u00b7 assessing the reasonableness of the impact of macroeconomic activity on short-term cash flows;\n- \u00b7 benchmarking management's forecasts against independent third-party economic and industry projections; and\n- \u00b7 comparing internal Company communications to management and the Board against the cash flow forecasts to evaluate for consistency.\n- \u00b7 We compared the actual results for the year ended 31 December 2022 to management's forecasts at the date of the annual impairment test to determine if any indicators of impairment existed.\n- \u00b7 We considered the potential impact of climate change on the carrying value of goodwill by holding discussions with management, with our sustainability specialists and within the Company and component engagement teams. These discussions identified the areas in which climate change, and in particular the Company's 2030 CO\u2082 emissions reduction target, may impact future projections. These projections include assumptions on cost of carbon and future climate-related capital expenditure  required to meet the Company's 2030 CO\u2082 emissions reduction target.\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the disclosures related to intangible assets and assessed the assumptions used in the impairment assessment for consistency with the impairment models and other information presented in the Annual Report.",

Revenue derived from long-term contracts in-progress at the balance sheet date involves judgement, particularly as it relates to the process of estimating revenue to be recognised, and total estimated costs of the contract.\n\nWe identified revenue recognition for certain long-term contracts in-progress at the balance sheet date ('certain long-term contracts') as a critical audit matter because of the judgements made by management to recognise revenue for certain long-term contracts in certain components whether due to bias or otherwise. This required extensive audit effort due to the complexity of certain long-term contracts and required a high degree of auditor judgement when performing audit procedures to audit management's estimates and evaluating the results of those procedures. We focused a proportion of our audit effort on a number of contracts where we consider there to be the highest degree of management judgement required and designed procedures to mitigate the associated risks.\n\nThe Audit Committee discussion of this critical audit matter is set out on page 97.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to management's recognition of revenue for certain long-term contracts at the balance sheet date in certain components included the following, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of relevant controls over long-term contract revenue, including management's controls over the estimates of total costs for performance obligations, and over the assessment of the recoverability of uncertified work in progress ('WIP') and aged debt.\n- \u00b7 We selected a sample of long-term contracts and:\n- \u00b7 assessed whether the contracts were properly included in management's calculation of long-term contract revenue based on the terms and conditions of each contract, including whether continuous transfer of control to the customer occurred as progress was made toward fulfilling the performance obligation;\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy and completeness of the costs incurred to date for the performance obligation to supporting documentation;\n- \u00b7 evaluated and challenged the estimates of total cost for the performance obligation by:\n- \u00b7 comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated, at either the inception of the contract or the start of the reporting period, to be incurred to date;\n- \u00b7 evaluating management's ability to accurately estimate the total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with the Company's project managers and engineers, and comparing the estimates to management's work plans, engineering specifications, and supplier contracts;\n- \u00b7 comparing management's estimates for the selected contracts to costs of similar performance obligations, when applicable; and\n- \u00b7 considering whether there were any indicators of bias in arriving at the Company's reported position.\n- \u00b7 tested the accuracy of WIP held on contracts at the balance sheet date by obtaining supporting documentation including customer agreement and subsequent certification and payment;\n- \u00b7 tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation of revenue for the performance obligation.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's ability to estimate total costs accurately by comparing actual costs to management's historical estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\n/s/ Deloitte Ireland LLP\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n## 1 March 2023\n\nThe first accounting period we audited was 31 December 2020.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) i ssued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of CRH plc as at 31 December 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated income statements and consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements') of the Company and our report dated 1 March 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Barrette Outdoor Living Inc., which was acquired on 8 July 2022, and whose financial statements constitute 5.0% and 3.4% of net and total assets, respectively, 1.1% of revenues, and its loss reduced Group profit by 1.0% in the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Barrette Outdoor Living Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte Ireland LLP\n\nDublin, Ireland\n\n1 March 2023\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n175",

IFRS as adopted by the European Union differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the differences have no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial years presented. The Consolidated Financial Statements are also prepared in compliance with the Companies Act 2014 and Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.\n\nCRH plc, the Parent Company, is a publicly traded limited company incorporated and domiciled in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in US Dollar millions, have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the measurement at fair value of share-based payments, retirement benefit obligations and certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Directors acknowledge that based on their review of the Group's activities, cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities for the financial year ended 31 December 2022, and having assessed the principal risks facing the Group, the Board of Directors has a reasonable expectation that CRH plc, and the Group as a whole, has adequate financial and other resources to continue in operational existence and will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due over the 12-month going concern period.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently by all of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to all periods presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCertain prior year disclosures have been amended to conform to current year presentation. An amount of $46 million relating to the unwinding of the discount element of lease liabilities has been reclassified from other financial expense to finance costs in the period ended 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $49 million) to align with current year presentation. This has no impact on total net finance costs or any other financial statement line items for any of the periods presented.\n\nIn accordance with Section 304 of the Companies Act 2014, the Company is availing of the exemption from presenting its individual profit and loss account to the Annual General Meeting and from filing it with the Registrar of Companies.\n\n## Adoption of IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations\n\nThe following standard amendments became effective for the Group as of 1 January 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations - Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds before Intended Use\n- \u00b7 Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract\n- \u00b7 Annual Improvements 2018 - 2020 Cycle\n\nThe standard amendments did not result in a material impact on the Group's results.\n\n## IFRS and IFRIC interpretations being adopted in subsequent years\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 which will be effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with presentation of comparative\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n181\n\nfigures required. The Group has evaluated the impact of this standard on future periods and it is not expected to be material.\n\nThere are no other IFRS or IFRIC interpretations that are effective subsequent to the CRH 2022 financial year-end that are expected to have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group.\n\n## Impact of Climate Change and Carbon Emissions Reduction Targets\n\nClimate change risks including the impact of achieving the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets and the risks identified in the TCFD disclosures on pages 56 to 59 have been considered and assessed in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022. There has been no material impact identified on the estimates and underlying assumptions made in the preparation of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of climate change risks. In line with the application of our accounting policies, estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis as we continue to develop and implement our strategy to meet our carbon emissions reduction targets. The table below provides details of where further information has been provided in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Climate Change and Carbon Emissions Reduction Targets References Pages\n\n| Impairment testing of goodwill and property, plant and equipment   | 182, 211   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Useful lives of assets                                             | 186, 209   |\n| Provisions for liabilities                                         | 183        |\n| Inventories                                                        | 187        |\n| Retirement Benefit Obligations                                     | 234        |\n\nThe Directors are aware of the ever-changing risks attached to climate change and regularly assess these risks against judgements and estimates made in the preparation of the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn early 2023, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated the alignment of our existing Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions reduction target to a 1.5\u00b0C warming scenario. The target previously aligned to a well below 2.0\u00b0C scenario. The Group's assessment is that the impact of the adoption of this updated target will not have a material impact on the estimates, judgements and assumptions set out in the relevant disclosures referenced above. The overall absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions reduction target by 2030 is consistent with the previous target.\n\n## Voluntary Change in Accounting Policy\n\nFor the period ended 31 December 2022, the Group retrospectively adopted a voluntary change in accounting policy in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors with respect to the presentation of operating cash flows under IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows . The impact of this change is to replace 'Profit before tax' with 'Group profit for the financial year' as the starting point for the reconciliation to net cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The new presentation reconciles net cash flows from operating activities on a total Group basis, including both continuing and discontinued operations. This has no impact on net cash inflow from operating activities or any other financial statement line items for the period ended 31 December 2022 or any comparative periods presented.\n\n## Key Accounting Policies which involve Estimates, Assumptions and Judgements\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates, assumptions and judgements that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Management believes that the estimates, assumptions and judgements upon which it relies are reasonable based on the information available to it at the time that those estimates, assumptions and judgements are made. In some cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by IFRS and does not require management's judgement in its application.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\nManagement considers that their use of estimates, assumptions and judgements in the application of the Group's accounting policies are inter-related and therefore discuss them together below with the major sources of estimation uncertainty and significant judgements separately identified.\n\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in accounting estimates may be necessary if there are changes in the circumstances or experiences on which the estimate was based or as a result of new information. The critical accounting policies, which involve significant estimates, assumptions or judgements, the actual outcome of which could have a material impact on the Group's results and financial position outlined below, are as follows:\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and property, plant and equipment Notes 13 and 14\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIn the year in which a business combination is effected and where some or all of the goodwill allocated to a particular cash-generating unit (CGU) arose in respect of that combination, the CGU is tested for impairment prior to the end of the relevant annual period.\n\nGoodwill is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis and at any time during the year if an indicator of impairment is considered to exist.\n\nWhere the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount (being the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use), an impairment loss is recognised by writing down goodwill to its recoverable amount.\n\n## Major sources of estimation uncertainty: Projected EBITDA (as defined)* margin, long-term growth and pre-tax discount rates\n\nThe impairment testing process requires management to make significant judgements and estimates regarding the future cash flows expected to be generated by CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. In assessing value-in-use net cash flow forecasts are extrapolated using long-term growth rates to determine the basis for an annuity-based terminal value. These net cash flow forecasts reflect volume, price and cost (including the cost of carbon where applicable) assumptions in addition to other cash flow movements. EBITDA (as defined)* margin is deemed an appropriate measure for assessing the estimation uncertainty associated with price and cost assumptions. Future cash flows, including the terminal value, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows attributable to financing activities and income tax. Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions which influence these variables.\n\nThe assumptions and conditions for determining impairments of goodwill reflect management's best assumptions and estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties described above, many of which are not under management's control.\n\nAs a result, the accounting for such items could result in different estimates or amounts if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods. A detailed discussion of the impairment methodology applied, key assumptions used and related sensitivity analyses by the Group in the context of goodwill is provided in note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated. Impairment losses arising in respect of goodwill are not reversed once recognised.\n\nGoodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment. Where indicators of impairment of an investment arise in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , the carrying amount is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying amount.\n\n* EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity\n\naccounted investments' profit after tax.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n182\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment assets are reviewed for potential impairment by applying a series of external and internal indicators specific to the assets under consideration. These indicators encompass macroeconomic issues including the inherent cyclicality of the building materials sector, actual obsolescence or physical damage, a deterioration in forecast performance in the internal reporting cycle and restructuring and rationalisation programmes. Consideration is also given to climate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on page 142, as well as to the actions required to deliver the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets when reviewing assets for potential impairment. A detailed discussion on this consideration is provided in note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWhere the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount (being the greater of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use), an impairment loss is recognised by writing down the assets to their recoverable amount. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined by reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIn assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted. The estimates of future cash flows exclude cash inflows or outflows attributable to financing activities and income tax.\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations - Note 28\n\nCosts arising in respect of the Group's defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred. The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions in the event that the fund does not hold sufficient assets to meet its benefit commitments.\n\nThe liabilities and costs associated with the Group's defined benefit pension schemes (both funded and unfunded) are assessed on the basis of the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries and are arrived at using actuarial assumptions based on market expectations at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Major sources of estimation uncertainty: Discount rates\n\nThe assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations (including discount rates , rates of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and healthcare cost trends), from which the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements are determined, are updated annually based on current economic conditions and for any relevant changes to the terms and conditions of the pension and post-retirement plans. These assumptions can be affected by (i) for the discount rates , changes in the rates of return on high-quality corporate bonds; (ii) for future compensation levels, future labour market conditions and (iii) for healthcare cost trend rates, the rate of medical cost inflation in the relevant regions. The weighted average actuarial assumptions used and sensitivity analysis in relation to the significant assumptions employed in the determination of pension and other post-retirement liabilities are contained in note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the measurement of retirement benefit obligations are the discount rates . The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nWhilst management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the obligations and expenses recognised in future accounting periods. The assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension schemes may exhibit significant period-on-period volatility attributable primarily to changes in bond yields and longevity. In addition to future service contributions, significant cash contributions may be required to remediate past service deficits.\n\nThe net surplus or deficit arising on each of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes, are shown either within non-current assets or noncurrent liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The deferred tax impact of pension scheme surpluses and deficits is disclosed separately within deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate.\n\nRemeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets (excluding net interest) and changes in the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding net interest), are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods.\n\nThe defined benefit pension asset or liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Plan assets are assets that are held by a long-term employee benefit fund or qualifying insurance policies. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of published quoted securities, it is the published bid price. The value of any defined benefit asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan and reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nDefined benefit pension surpluses are recognised as assets to the extent that they are considered recoverable, which is generally by way of a refund or lower future employer contributions. Where there is no unconditional right to a refund or reduction in future contributions, we restrict the assets of the scheme by applying the asset ceiling test, which limits the net defined benefit surplus to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nThe Group's obligation in respect of post-employment healthcare and life assurance benefits represents the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is computed on the basis of the projected unit credit method and is discounted to present value using a discount rate equating to the market yield at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and estimated term of the post employment obligations.\n\n## Provisions for liabilities - Note 26\n\nA provision is recognised when the Group has a present obligation (either legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n## Significant judgement:\n\nJudgement is required in determining whether the Group has a present obligation and whether it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle this obligation. This judgement is applied to information available at the time of determining the liability including but not limited to judgements around interpretations of legislation, regulations, case law and insurance contracts depending on the nature of the provision.\n\nWhere the Group anticipates that a provision will be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset only when it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will arise. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.\n\nThe increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.\n\nContingent liabilities arising on business combinations are recognised as provisions if the contingent liability can be reliably measured at its acquisition date fair value. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n183\n\nManagement is not aware of any potential changes to key assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of provisions within the next financial year; however, due to the nature of some of our provisions, estimates may depend on the outcome of future events and need to be revised as circumstances change in future accounting periods. Refer to note 26 for the expected timing of outflows by provisions category.\n\n## Environmental and remediation provisions\n\nThe measurement of environmental and remediation provisions is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, currently enacted laws and regulations and prior experience in remediation of sites. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, the protracted length of the clean-up periods and evolving technologies.\n\nThe environmental and remediation liabilities provided for in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the judgement applied by management in respect of information available at the time of determining the liability and are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available.\n\nThe impact of climate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on page 142 on environmental and remediation provisions has been considered, specifically the impact on timing and extent of costs and cash outflows. Changes to legislation, including those relating to climate change, are factored into the assessment of provisions when the legislation is virtually certain to be enacted. The Group's carbon emissions reduction targets is also considered in these judgements. The measurement of our provisions is based on reasonable and supportable assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist in the foreseeable future. These assumptions do not have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying value of these provisions within the next financial year and therefore do not represent a major source of estimation uncertainty.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties described above, many of which are not under management's control, actual costs and cash outflows could differ if management used different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future accounting periods.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nThe status of each significant claim and legal proceeding in which the Group is involved is reviewed by management on a periodic basis and the Group's potential financial exposure is assessed. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable, and the amount can be reliably estimated, a liability is recognised for the estimated loss.\n\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent in such matters, the related provisions are based on the best information available at the time; the issues taken into account by management and factored into the assessment of legal contingencies include, as applicable, the status of settlement negotiations, interpretations of contractual obligations, prior experience with similar contingencies/claims, and advice obtained from legal counsel and other third parties. As additional information becomes available on pending claims, the potential liability is reassessed and revisions are made to the amounts accrued where appropriate. Such revisions in the judgements and estimates of the potential liabilities could have an impact on the results of operations and financial position of the Group in future accounting periods.\n\n## Insurance provisions\n\nInsurance provisions are subject to actuarial valuation and are based on actuarial triangulations which are extrapolated from historical claims experience. These provisions include claims which are classified as 'incurred but not reported', the status of which are reviewed periodically by management, in conjunction with appropriately qualified advisors. Changes in actuarial methodologies and assumptions, along with the receipt of new information, could have an impact on the financial position of the Group through recognition of additional, or release of, provisions in future accounting periods.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Other Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements of the Parent Company and all subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year, and the Group's share of the results of joint ventures and associates which are accounted for using the equity method. The financial year-ends of the Group's subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are coterminous.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary without a change in control is accounted for as an equity transaction.\n\nWhen the Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other facts and circumstances including contractual arrangements that give the Group power over the investee may result in the Group controlling the investee. The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if, and when, facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to the elements evidencing control.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the portion of the equity of a subsidiary not attributable either directly or indirectly to the Parent Company and are presented separately in the Consolidated Income Statement and within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, distinguished from Parent Company shareholders' equity. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. On an acquisition by acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures - Note 15\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of an entity, but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of the arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nThe Group's investments in its associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method from the date significant influence/joint control is deemed to arise until the date on which significant influence/joint control ceases to exist or when the interest becomes classified as an asset held for sale.\n\nThe Consolidated Income Statement reflects the Group's share of result after tax of the related associates and joint ventures. Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost adjusted in respect of post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets, less any impairment in value. Loans advanced to associates or joint ventures form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture held in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , including the impairment requirements, to these loans as the equity method does not apply. If necessary, impairment losses on the carrying amount of an investment are reported within the Group's share of equity accounted investments' results in the Consolidated Income Statement. If the Group's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of an associate or joint venture, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred obligations in respect of the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nThe Group's investments in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its assets and its liabilities, including its share of any assets or liabilities held\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n184\n\njointly; its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.\n\n## Revenue recognition - Note 1\n\nThe Group recognises revenue in the amount of the price expected to be received for goods and services supplied at a point in time or over time, as contractual performance obligations are fulfilled and control of goods and services passes to the customer. It excludes trade discounts and value-added tax/sales tax.\n\n## Revenue derived from sale of goods (sources other than construction contracts)\n\nThe Group manufactures and supplies a diverse range of building materials and products. Whilst there are a number of different activities across the Group; recognition of revenue from the sale of goods is similar; being at the point in time when control is deemed to pass to the customer upon leaving a CRH premises or upon delivery to a customer depending on the terms of the sale. Contracts do not contain multiple performance obligations (as defined by IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ).\n\nAcross the Group, goods are often sold with discounts or rebates based on cumulative sales over a period. This variable consideration is only recognised when it is highly probable that it will not be subsequently reversed and is recognised using the most likely amount or expected value methods, depending on the individual contract terms. In the application of appropriate revenue recognition, judgement is exercised by management in the determination of the likelihood and quantum of such items based on experience and historical trading patterns.\n\nThe Group is deemed to be a principal to an arrangement when it controls a promised good or service before transferring them to a customer and accordingly recognises revenue on a gross basis. Where the Group is determined to be an agent to a transaction, based on the principle of control, the net amount retained after the deduction of any costs to the principal is recognised as revenue. Within the non-construction contract businesses no element of financing is deemed present as transactions are all made with average credit terms (usually 90 days), consistent with market practice.\n\n## Revenue derived from construction contracts\n\nThe Group enters into a number of construction contracts, to complete large construction projects. Contracts usually commence and complete within one year and are generally fixed price, but may be subject to indexation and/or escalation clauses that can either increase or decrease the final transaction price.\n\nThe Group typically recognises revenue within its construction contract businesses over time, as it performs its obligations. Management believe this best reflects the transfer of control to the customer by providing a faithful depiction of primarily the enhancement of a customer controlled asset or the construction of an asset with no alternative use.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion method is used to recognise revenue when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably. The percentage-of-completion is calculated using an input method and based on the proportion of contract costs incurred at the balance sheet date relative to the total estimated costs of the contract. In all of our construction contract arrangements the Group has an enforceable right to payment for work and performance obligations completed to date.\n\nSome of the Group's construction contracts may contain forms of variable consideration that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount or expected value methods (depending on the contract terms) and the transaction price is adjusted to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will not occur.\n\nIn some instances revenue is recognised in the period subsequent to the contracted work being completed when there is final certainty over the remaining element of variable consideration.",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\nGovernance\n\n## Recognition of contract assets and liabilities\n\nIn our construction contract businesses, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with pre-agreed contractual terms. When a performance obligation is satisfied but a customer has not yet been billed this is recognised as a contract asset (unbilled revenue) and included within Trade and Other Receivables (note 17). Retentions (representing the percentage of consideration due which is retained by the customer until certain contractual activities are completed) are also a common feature of construction contracts and are recognised as a contract asset within Trade and Other Receivables when we have a right to consideration in exchange for the completion of the contract. Retentions are consistent with industry norms and the purpose of these is not to provide a form of financing. Apart from retentions, the Group does not have any construction contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group applies the practical expedient in IFRS 15 and does not adjust any of its transaction prices for the time value of money.\n\nWhen consideration is received in advance of work being performed, or we have billed an amount to a customer that is in excess of revenue recognised on the contract; this is recognised as a contract liability within Trade and Other Payables (note 18); and the revenue is generally recognised in the subsequent period when the right to recognise revenue has been determined. As a result, advance payments received for construction contract arrangements are not considered a significant form of financing.\n\nCumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, after deducting onerous provisions, provisions for contingencies and payments on account not matched with revenue, are included as construction contract balances in inventories (note 16). Cost includes all expenditure directly related to specific projects and an allocation of fixed and variable overheads incurred in the Group's contract activities based on normal operating capacity. The Group's contracts generally are for a duration of less than one year and therefore the Group does not capitalise incremental contract costs; instead expensing as incurred, as permitted by the practical expedient under IFRS 15.\n\n## Onerous contracts and warranties\n\nWhen a contract is identified as being onerous (i.e. its unavoidable cost exceeds the economic benefit of the contract), a provision is created; being the lower of costs to complete the contract and the cost of exiting the contract. The Group recognises a provision for assurance-type (standard) warranties offered across the Group under its terms and conditions in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . The Group provides assurancetype warranties for general repairs and does not typically provide service-type (extended) warranties.\n\n## Segment reporting - Note 2\n\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal organisational and management structure and the internal reporting information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale - Note 3\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within 12 months from the date of classification as held for sale.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. The Group ceases to use the equity method of accounting from the date on which an interest in a joint venture or associate becomes held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and liabilities directly associated with those assets are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n185\n\n## Discontinued operations - Note 3\n\nDiscontinued operations are reported when a component of the Group, that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, has been disposed of, or when a sale is highly probable; its operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished, operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the rest of the Group and is classified as held for sale or has been disposed of. The Group classifies a non-current asset or disposal group as held for sale if its carrying value will be recovered through a sales transaction or distribution to shareholders rather than continuing use.\n\nIn the Consolidated Income Statement, discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and are presented as a single amount as profit or loss after tax from discontinued operations. Corresponding notes to the Consolidated Income Statement exclude amounts for discontinued operations, unless stated otherwise.\n\n## Share-based payments - Note 8\n\nThe Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment plans. Details of these plans, together with the nature of the underlying market and nonmarket performance and other vesting conditions are outlined in note 8. The Group has no material exposure in respect of cash-settled share-based payment transactions and share-based payment transactions with cash alternatives.\n\n## Awards under Performance Share Plans\n\n20% of the awards under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are subject to a TSR (and hence market-based) vesting condition measured against a tailored sector peer group (2020 and 2021: 25%). Accordingly, the fair value assigned to the related equity instruments at the grant date is derived using a Monte Carlo simulation technique to model the market-based performance conditions; and is adjusted to reflect the anticipated likelihood as at the grant date of achieving the vesting condition. Awards are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.\n\nThe remaining awards granted under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are subject to non-market-based vesting conditions; 45% are subject to a cumulative cash flow target (2020 and 2021: 50%) and 20% are subject to a RONA metric (2020 and 2021: 25%). In 2022 a new sustainability and diversity scorecard metric of 15% was introduced for awards made in 2022 (a nonmarket-based vesting condition). The fair value of the awards is calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant. No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest. At the balance sheet date the estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed and any adjustment necessary is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nIf awards which vest under the 2014 Performance Share Plan are allotted to an Employee Benefit Trust, an increase in nominal share capital and share premium are recognised accordingly on allotment.\n\n## Savings-related Share Option Scheme\n\nThe fair values assigned to options under the Savings-related Share Option Scheme are derived in accordance with the trinomial valuation methodology on the basis that the services to be rendered by employees as consideration for the granting of share options will be received over the vesting period, which is assessed as at the grant date.\n\nThe cost is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The Consolidated Income Statement expense/credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that period. The cumulative charge to the Consolidated Income Statement is reversed only where an employee in receipt of share options leaves service prior to completion of the expected vesting period and those options forfeit in consequence.\n\nWhere an award is cancelled, it is treated as if it is vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the Company or the employee are not met. All cancellations of awards are treated equally.",

Where items are accounted for outside of profit or loss, the related income tax is recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised using the liability method on temporary differences arising at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. For the most part, no provision has been made for temporary differences applicable to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. However, a temporary difference has been recognised to the extent that specific assets have been identified for sale or where there is a specific intention to unwind the temporary difference in the foreseeable future. Due to the absence of control in the context of associates (significant influence only), deferred tax liabilities are recognised where appropriate in respect of CRH's investments in these entities on the basis that the exercise of significant influence would not necessarily prevent earnings being remitted by other shareholders in the undertaking.\n\nDeferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not subject to discounting. Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are subject to review at each balance sheet date and are reduced to the extent that future taxable profits are considered to be inadequate to allow all or part of any deferred tax asset to be utilised.\n\nThe Group's income tax charge is based on reported profit and enacted statutory tax rates, which reflect various allowances and reliefs available to the Group in the multiple tax jurisdictions in which it operates. The determination of the Group's provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. In addition, the Group is subject to tax audits which can involve complex issues that could require extended periods to conclude, the resolution of which is often not within the control of the Group. Although management believes that the estimates included in the Consolidated Financial Statements and its tax return positions are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group's historical income tax provisions and accruals. Whilst it is possible, the Group does not currently anticipate that any such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and profit for the period in which such a determination is made nor does it expect any significant impact on its financial position within the next 12 months. This is based on the Group's knowledge and experience, as well as the profile of the individual components which have been reflected in the current tax liability, the status of the tax audits, enquiries and negotiations in progress at each year-end, previous claims and any factors specific to the relevant tax environments.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - Note 13\n\nThe carrying value of property, plant and equipment (excluding leased right-ofuse assets) of $17,663 million at 31 December 2022 represents 39% of total assets at that date. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairments except for certain\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n186\n\nitems that had been revalued to fair value prior to the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004).\n\nRepair and maintenance expenditure is included in an asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repair and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement during the financial period in which it is incurred.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred in the construction of major assets which take a substantial period of time to complete are capitalised in the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nIn the application of the Group's accounting policy, judgement is exercised by management in the determination of residual values and useful lives.\n\nDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the depreciation period or method as appropriate on a prospective basis.\n\nAmongst other factors, consideration is given to climate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on page 142 when determining the useful lives of assets. The determination of useful lives also considers the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets. Capital expenditure will continue to be required for ongoing projects and the useful lives of future capital expenditure may differ from current assumptions, however there were no significant changes in the estimates of useful lives during the current financial year.\n\nFuture developments in technology may also result in a risk of obsolescence for the Group's current portfolio of plant and machinery assets, however the expected timeframe for these developments is not currently anticipated to impact their remaining useful lives as the majority of the Group's plant and machinery assets will be fully depreciated within ten years.\n\nDepreciation and depletion is calculated to write off the book value of each item of property, plant and equipment over its useful economic life on a straight-line basis at the following rates:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\nThe book value of mineral-bearing land, less an estimate of its residual value, is depleted over the period of the mineral extraction in the proportion which production for the year bears to the latest estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves. Land, other than mineral-bearing land, is not depreciated. In general, buildings are depreciated at 2.5% per annum (p.a.).\n\n## Plant and machinery\n\nThese are depreciated at rates ranging from 3.3% p.a. to 20% p.a. depending on the type of asset. Plant and machinery includes transport vehicles which are, on average, depreciated at 20% p.a.\n\n## Business combinations - Note 30\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred (excluding amounts relating to the settlement of preexisting relationships), the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and, in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously-held equity interest in the acquiree. Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\n\nTo the extent that settlement of all or any part of consideration for a business combination is deferred, the fair value of the deferred component is determined through discounting the amounts payable to their present value at the date of exchange. The discount component is unwound as an interest charge in the Consolidated Income Statement over the life of the obligation. Any contingent consideration is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and included in the cost of the acquisition. The fair value of contingent consideration at acquisition date is arrived at through discounting the expected payment to present value. In general, in order for contingent consideration to become payable, pre-defined profit and/or profit/net asset ratios must be exceeded. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be",

Contingent liabilities assumed in business combination activity are recognised as of the acquisition date, where such contingent liabilities are present obligations arising from past events and their fair value can be measured reliably. In the case of a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously-held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date through profit or loss. When the initial accounting for a business combination is determined provisionally, any adjustments to the provisional values allocated to the consideration, identifiable assets or liabilities (and contingent liabilities, if relevant) are made within the measurement period, a period of no more than one year from the acquisition date.\n\n## Goodwill - Note 14\n\nGoodwill arising on a business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition and relates to the future economic benefits arising from assets which are not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. If the cost of the acquisition is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the identification and measurement of the related assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities are revisited and the cost is reassessed with any remaining balance recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill in respect of associates and joint ventures is included in investments accounted for using the equity method (i.e. within financial assets) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nWhere a subsidiary is disposed of or terminated through closure, the carrying value of any goodwill of that subsidiary is included in the determination of the net profit or loss on disposal/termination.\n\n## Intangible assets (other than goodwill) arising on business combinations - Note 14\n\nAn intangible asset is capitalised separately from goodwill as part of a business combination at cost (fair value at date of acquisition).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying values of definite-lived intangible assets (the Group does not currently have any indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill) are reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date and are subject to impairment testing when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.\n\nIntangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis. In general, based on the current composition of definite-lived intangible assets, the useful lives for customer-related intangible assets range from five to twenty years and the useful lives for marketing related intangible assets range from ten to thirty years.\n\nAmortisation periods, useful lives, expected patterns of consumption and residual values are reviewed at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method as appropriate on a prospective basis.\n\n## Leases - Notes 13 and 20\n\nThe Group enters into leases for a range of assets, principally relating to property. These property leases have varying terms, renewal rights and escalation clauses, including periodic rent reviews linked with a consumer price index and/or other indices. The Group also leases plant and machinery, vehicles and equipment. The terms and conditions of these leases do not impose significant financial restrictions on the Group.\n\nA contract contains a lease if it is enforceable and conveys the right to control the use of a specified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration, which\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n187\n\nis assessed at inception. A right-of-use asset and lease liability are recognised at the commencement date for contracts containing a lease, with the exception of leases with a term of 12 months or less which do not contain a purchase option, leases where the underlying asset is of low value and leases with associated payments that vary directly in line with usage or sales. The commencement date is the date at which the asset is made available for use by the Group.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate or the interest rate implicit in the lease, if this is readily determinable, over the remaining lease term. Lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable payments that are dependent on a rate or index known at the commencement date, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees and any payments for an optional renewal period and purchase and termination option payments, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise those options. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for any renewal or termination options which are reasonably certain to be exercised.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate and rentals relating to low value or short-term leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. Management applies judgement in determining whether it is reasonably certain that a renewal, termination or purchase option will be exercised.\n\nIncremental borrowing rates are calculated using a portfolio approach, based on the risk profile of the entity holding the lease and the term and currency of the lease.\n\nAfter initial recognition, the lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments or when the Group changes its assessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an option within the contract. A corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the lease liability adjusted for any payments made at or before the commencement date, initial direct costs incurred, lease incentives received and an estimate of the cost to dismantle or restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located at the end of the lease term. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term or, where a purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised, over the useful economic life of the asset in line with depreciation rates for owned property, plant and equipment. The right-of-use asset is tested periodically for impairment if an impairment indicator is considered to exist.\n\nNon-lease components in a contract such as maintenance and other service charges are separated from lease payments and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Inventories - Note 16\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in/first-out principle (and weighted average, where appropriate) and includes all expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. Raw materials are valued on the basis of purchase cost on a first-in/first-out basis. In the case of finished goods and workin-progress, cost includes direct materials, direct labour and attributable overheads based on normal operating capacity and excludes borrowing costs.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated proceeds of sale less all further costs to completion, and less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Estimates of net realisable value are based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates are made, taking into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the period, the likelihood of short-term changes in buyer preferences, product obsolescence or perishability (all of which are generally low given the nature of the Group's products) and the purpose for which the inventory is held.\n\nClimate change and policy risks and uncertainties as set out on page 142 may also result in additional costs, changes to selling prices or product obsolescence impacting the valuation of inventories in future years. However, due to the short inventory turnover cycle there were no material write-downs of inventories required in this regard during the current financial year.\n\nMaterials and other supplies held for use in the production of inventories are not written down below cost if the finished goods, in which they will be incorporated, are expected to be sold at or above cost.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting Policies continued\n\n## Trade and other receivables - Note 17\n\nThe classification of financial assets depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets are its trade and other receivables (including contract assets). Trade and other receivables are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contract and has a legal right to receive cash. Trade receivables (including contract assets) are carried at original invoice amount, which is equivalent to amortised cost, less an expected credit loss provision.\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with trade and other receivables at each balance sheet date. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the Group expects to receive. Where the present value of such cash flows is lower than the carrying value, the carrying value of the asset is adjusted, with the impairment gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nFurther detail on the Group's methodology for providing for expected credit losses is provided in note 17.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents - Note 23\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and investments which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Cash and cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortised cost or, in the case of certain money market deposits, fair value through profit or loss.\n\nBank overdrafts are included within current interest-bearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Where the overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of cash management, they are netted against cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans and borrowings - Note 24\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recorded at the fair value of the consideration received net of directly attributable transaction costs. The computation of amortised cost includes any issue costs and any discount or premium materialising on settlement. Subsequent to initial recognition, current and non-current interest-bearing loans and borrowings are, in general, measured at amortised cost employing the effective interest methodology. Fixed rate loans and borrowings, which have been hedged to floating rates (using interest rate swaps), are measured at amortised cost adjusted for changes in value attributable to the hedged risks arising from changes in underlying market interest rates.\n\nBorrowing costs arising on financial instruments are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred (unless capitalised as part of the cost of property, plant and equipment).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging practices Note 25\n\nIn order to manage interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risks and to realise the desired currency profile of borrowings, the Group employs derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps, currency forwards and currency swaps). Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. The carrying value of derivatives is fair value based on discounted future cash flows and adjusted for counterparty risk. Future floating rate cash flows are estimated based on future interest rates (from observable yield curves at the end of the reporting period). Fixed and floating rate cash flows are discounted at future interest rates and translated at period-end foreign exchange rates. Short dated forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the forward foreign exchange risk on currency exposures. The forward price elements to these contracts are excluded from the hedge.\n\nAt the inception of a derivative transaction, the Group documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed transaction. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n188\n\nrelationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedging instrument in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items. Where derivatives do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in fair values are reported in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Fair value and cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group uses fair value hedges and cash flow hedges in its treasury activities. For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges (which entail hedging the exposure to movements in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment that could affect profit or loss) or cash flow hedges (which hedge exposure to fluctuations in future cash flows derived from a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss).\n\nWhere the conditions for hedge accounting are satisfied and the hedging instrument concerned is classified as a fair value hedge, any gain or loss stemming from the remeasurement of the hedging instrument to fair value is reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. In addition, any gain or loss on the hedged item which is attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interestbearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the Consolidated Income Statement with the objective of achieving full amortisation by maturity.\n\nWhere a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised as other comprehensive income, net of the income tax effect, with the ineffective portion being reported in the Consolidated Income Statement. The associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement contemporaneously with the materialisation of the hedged transaction.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised as other comprehensive income remains there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer anticipated to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised as other comprehensive income is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nWhere foreign currency swaps provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign operation, and the hedge is deemed to be effective, foreign exchange differences are taken directly to a foreign currency translation reserve. The ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Cumulative gains and losses remain in equity until disposal of the net investment in the foreign operation at which point the related differences are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the overall gain or loss on sale.\n\n## Share capital and dividends - Notes 29 and 11\n\n## Treasury Shares and own shares\n\nOrdinary Shares acquired by the Parent Company through the share buyback programme (Treasury Shares) or purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Parent Company under the terms of the Performance Share Plans and the Restricted Share Plan (own shares) are deducted from equity and presented on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Parent Company's Ordinary Shares. A financial liability is recorded if a contractual obligation to repurchase shares exists at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Parent Company and approved by shareholders in respect of final dividends.",

The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollar, which is the presentation currency of the Group. The functional currency of the Parent Company is euro.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange in effect at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. All currency translation differences are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement with the exception of all monetary items that provide an effective hedge for a net investment in a foreign operation. These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nResults and cash flows of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates with nonUS Dollar functional currencies have been translated into US Dollar at average exchange rates for the year, and the related balance sheets have been translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.

As the essential partner for road and critical utility infrastructure, commercial building projects and outdoor living solutions, CRH's unique offering of materials, products and value-added services helps to deliver a more resilient and sustainable built environment.\n\nThe Group has three operating segments (as identified under IFRS 8 Operating Segments ) generating revenue through the following activities:\n\nOur Americas Materials businesses provide solutions for the construction and RMI of public infrastructure, homes and commercial buildings across North America. Our businesses in the US and Canada utilise an extensive network of reserve backed quarry locations, to provide asphalt paving services and to produce and supply a range of materials including cement, aggregates, readymixed concrete and asphalt. This segment also includes the Group's cement operations in Brazil, which was divested in April 2021.\n\nOur Building Products segment manufactures, supplies and delivers high quality, value-added innovative products and solutions to shape and enhance the built environment for modern communities. This includes Architectural Products, Infrastructure Products and Construction Accessories. This is a global business operating in attractive construction markets in major economies in North America, Europe and Asia. The divestment of our Building Envelope business, formerly part of the Building Products segment, was completed in April 2022. As a result, it has been classified as discontinued operations in the current year; its performance in this year and comparative years is therefore part of discontinued operations.\n\nOur Europe Materials businesses provides solutions for the construction of public infrastructure, homes and commercial buildings to customers in construction markets across 19 countries in Europe and 2 countries in Asia. An extensive network of quarry and production locations adjacent to attractive local construction markets produce cement, lime, aggregates, asphalt, readymixed concrete and concrete products, as well as providing paving and construction services.\n\n## A. Disaggregated revenue\n\nIn the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographic market and by principal activities and products.

The individual entities within the Group have a large number of customers spread across various activities, enduses and geographies.\n\nRevenue derived through the supply of services and intersegment revenue are not material to the Group. The transfer pricing policy implemented by the Group between operating segments and across its constituent entities is described in note 32. In addition, due to the nature of building materials, which have a low value-to-weight ratio, the Group's revenue streams include a low level of crossborder transactions.\n\n## B. Contract balances\n\nFor information on the Group's construction contract balances, including movements during the year, refer to notes 16, 17 and 18. Movements in our net contract balances are not considered significant and are primarily driven by the timing of billing work-in-progress within our construction contract businesses.\n\n* Revenue principally recognised over time. Construction contracts are generally completed within the same financial reporting year.\n\n## C. Unsatisfied long-term construction contracts and other performance obligations\n\nRevenue yet to be recognised from long-term construction contracts, primarily within our Americas Materials and Europe Materials businesses, amounted to $3,742 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: $3,177 million; 2020: $2,604 million). The Group has applied the practical expedient set out in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers whereby revenue yet to be recognised on contracts that had an original expected duration of less than one year is not disclosed. The majority of open contracts at 31 December 2022 will close and revenue will be recognised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n192",

The segments reflect the Group's organisational structure in 2022 and the nature of the financial information reported to and assessed by the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, who are together determined to fulfil the role of Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8).\n\nEffective 1 January 2022, following the appointment of the Chief Operating Officer and a resultant change in the reporting line of the 'segment managers' as outlined in IFRS 8, the Group has determined that the Group Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer (formerly the Group Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer) together fulfil the role of Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8). This did not result in any change to the Group's operating segments. No operating segments have been aggregated to form these reportable segments.\n\nEffective 1 January 2023 the Group restructured into two Divisions, CRH Americas and CRH Europe. During the first quarter of 2023, the Group's reportable segments increased from three to the following four segments: Americas Materials Solutions, Americas Building Solutions, Europe Materials Solutions and Europe Building Solutions. This realignment reflects the way resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.\n\nIn the Group's financial reporting for 2023 comparative information for 2021 and 2022 will be restated to reflect the changes in reportable segments. Segmental information presented in these financial statements is based on the segment structure as at 31 December 2022 being Americas Materials, Building Products and Europe Materials.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n193\n\nThe change in segment reporting post year end does not have a financial impact on the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe principal factors employed in the identification of the three segments reflected in this note include:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's organisational structure in 2022 (during 2022 each divisional President fulfilled the role of 'segment manager' as outlined in IFRS 8);\n- \u00b7 the nature of the reporting lines to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (as defined in IFRS 8);\n- \u00b7 the structure of internal reporting documentation such as management accounts and budgets; and\n- \u00b7 the degree of homogeneity of products and services within each of the segments from which revenue is derived\n\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker monitors the operating results of segments separately in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Segment performance is evaluated using EBITDA (as defined)*. Given that net finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purposes of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker and are accordingly omitted from the detailed segmental analysis below.

With the exception of our Building Envelope business, no other businesses divested during 2022 are considered to be either separate major lines of business or geographical areas of operation and therefore do not constitute discontinued operations as defined in IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations .\n\nNo businesses met the IFRS 5 held for sale criteria at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe table below sets out the proceeds and related profit recognised on divestment which were included in profit after tax for the financial year from discontinued operations.\n\n|                                                              | 2022 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Assets/(liabilities) disposed of at net carrying amount:     |           |\n| - non-current assets*                                        | 2,016     |\n| - cash and cash equivalents                                  | 27        |\n| - inventories, receivables, payables and provisions          | 406       |\n| - lease liabilities                                          | (338)     |\n| - interest-bearing loans and borrowings                      | (6)       |\n| - deferred tax                                               | (42)      |\n| - retirement benefit obligations                             | (14)      |\n| Net assets disposed                                          | 2,049     |\n| Reclassification of currency translation effects on disposal | 5         |\n| Total                                                        | 2,054     |\n| Proceeds from disposal (net of disposal costs)               | 3,525     |\n| Profit on disposal from discontinued operations              | 1,471     |\n| Net cash inflow arising on disposal                          |           |\n| Proceeds from disposal from discontinued operations          | 3,525     |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents disposed                     | (27)      |\n| Total                                                        | 3,498     |\n\n* Non-current assets comprise property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and investments accounted for using the equity method.",

Specific climate-related considerations during 2022 included:\n\n- \u00b7 considering potential future business optimisation levers that may occur and the impact on useful lives;\n- \u00b7 assessing the useful lives of transport and mobile equipment in the context of decarbonisation of our transport and mobile equipment, this being identified as one of our decarbonisation roadmap levers. It is assumed that transport and mobile equipment will be transitioned to lower carbon emitting units in line with normal asset retirement timelines;\n- \u00b7 assessing the impact of the capital expenditure required to meet the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets on the useful lives of existing PP&E. The nature of the proposed projects required to deliver our targets, including technology advancements, and their impact on existing PP&E was also considered; and\n- \u00b7 assessing the impact of physical risk to PP&E, in the context of the exposure of the Group's locations to potential future adverse weather impacts\n\nCapital expenditure will continue to be required to deliver our targets and mitigate potential physical risks. Therefore, the useful lives of future capital expenditure may differ from current assumptions. However, as a result of the assessments set out above, there were no significant changes in the estimates of useful lives or asset values during the current financial year.\n\n| Future purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment   |   2022 $m |   2021 (iv) $m |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Contracted for but not provided in the financial statements     |       862 |            628 |\n| Authorised by the Directors but not contracted for              |       530 |            417 |",

The CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and are not larger than the operating segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8. A total of 22 (2021:22) CGUs have been identified and these are analysed between the three business segments below. All businesses within the various CGUs exhibit similar and/or consistent profit margin and asset intensity characteristics.

The recoverable amount of 22 CGUs is determined based on a value-in-use (VIU) computation.\n\nThe cash flow forecasts are primarily based on a five-year strategic plan document formally approved by the Board of Directors and specifically exclude the impact of future development activity and capital expenditure that would enhance the assets' performance. To align with the Group's acquisition modelling methodology, these cash flows are extrapolated out for an additional five years, using externally sourced growth rates, to determine the basis for an annuity-based terminal value. The methodology allows, in very limited circumstances, to adjust cash flows past the strategic plan horizon, where deemed appropriate.\n\nNo adjustments were made to years 6-10 cash flows for the purpose of the 2022 impairment testing.\n\nAs in prior years, the terminal value is based on a 20-year annuity, with the exception of certain long-lived cement assets, where an assumption of a 30-year annuity has been used. Projected cash flows beyond the initial evaluation period have been extrapolated using real growth rates ranging from 1.9% in the Americas, 0.8% to 3.0% in Europe and 3.0% in Asia. Such real growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the countries in which each CGU operates. The VIU represents the present value of the future cash flows, including the terminal value, discounted at a rate appropriate to each CGU. The real pre-tax discount rate used for purposes of impairment testing on Ukraine CGU was 16.9%. Excluding Ukraine, the real pre-tax discount rates used range from 6.0% to 9.5% (2021: 6.5% to 8.6%). These rates are in line with the Group's estimated weighted average cost of capital, arrived at using the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing process has resulted in no intangible asset impairments (2021: $nil million).\n\n## Climate risk and impairment testing\n\nThe impact of climate change risks including the risks identified as part of the TCFD disclosures on pages 56 to 59, with a particular focus on carbon costs, has been considered as part of the impairment testing process through net cash flow estimations and the duration of discounted cash flow models. In addition, the capital expenditure required to meet our carbon emissions reduction targets was also incorporated into our net cash flows.\n\nOur Cement and Lime businesses represent our largest contributor to CO 2 emissions and consequently have the largest exposure to carbon costs. The net cash flows included in VIU assessments, reflect carbon costs that are reasonably estimated to be incurred over the assessment period, based on current Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) in place at the date of testing and known changes to regulations over the strategic plan horizon. The internal carbon prices applied in VIU assessments reflect the most recent carbon credits purchased by the Group along with the latest International Energy Agency (IEA) carbon price projections for the applicable regions where the Group operates.\n\nThe purchase of carbon allowances is managed by a central unit which buys forward to secure supply and de-risk the cost bases ahead of time. This helps provide the Group with near-term certainty on carbon prices and associated costs.\n\nWhile none of the significant CGUs identified on page 212 currently has a material exposure to carbon costs and as such carbon costs are not deemed a key assumption, the Directors are aware of the ever-changing risks attached to climate change and will regularly assess these risks against judgements and estimates made in future VIU assessments.\n\nWhile no adjustments in relation to carbon costs were made to years 6-10 cash flows for the purposes of impairment testing, on the basis of assumed cost recovery through pricing, CRH completed a scenario analysis that was aligned to the Paris Agreement to assess the potential impacts of higher carbon costs past the strategic plan period. Key variables included carbon prices based upon the IEA Net Zero scenario (which assumes $140 per tonne in 2030 increasing to $250 per tonne in 2050) and higher costs arising from the EU's introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The impact of increasing carbon prices and declining free allowances (where applicable) was analysed across our material Cement and Lime CGUs in combination with forecast levels of cost recovery through pricing. The analysis concluded there was no material impact on any of the CGUs reviewed primarily due to the levels of headroom in these CGUs and an assumption of cost recovery through pricing. The Group continues to monitor the emergence of CO 2 regulatory pronouncements which will be factored into strategic plans once enacted.\n\n## Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe cash flows have been arrived at by taking into account the Group's strong financial position, its established history of earnings and cash flow generation and the nature of the building materials industry. However, expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and are therefore liable to material change over time. The key assumptions employed in arriving at the estimates of future cash flows factored into impairment testing are subjective and include projected EBITDA (as defined)* margins, long-term growth and discount rates used and the duration of the discounted cash flow model.\n\nWhile carbon costs are considered a climate-related risk under our TCFD disclosures, they are not considered a major source of estimation uncertainty on their own for 2022. The impact of this risk from an impairment perspective is reflected through EBITDA (as defined)* margin which as set out on page 182 is a major source of estimation uncertainty.",

The cash flows and annuity-based terminal value were projected in line with the methodology disclosed above.\n\nThe Americas Cement, AMAT South and Building Products CGUs are not included in the 'Sensitivity analysis' section below. Given the magnitude of the excess of VIU over carrying amount, and our belief that the key assumptions are reasonable, management believes that it is not reasonably possible that there would be a change in the key assumptions such that the carrying amount would exceed the VIU.\n\nConsequently no further disclosures relating to sensitivity of the value-in-use computations for the Americas Cement, AMAT South or Building Products CGUs are considered to be warranted.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nA qualitative and quantitative assessment has been performed and results in additional sensitivity disclosures for two of the total 22 CGUs. The key assumptions, methodology used and values applied to each of the key assumptions for these CGUs are in line with those outlined above (a 30-year annuity period has been used). The two CGUs have aggregate goodwill of $665 million at the date of testing. The table below identifies the amounts by which each of the following assumptions may either decline or increase to arrive at a zero excess of the present value of future cash flows over the book value of net assets in the two CGUs selected for sensitivity analysis disclosures:\n\n|                                          | two cash-generating units     |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Reduction in EBITDA (as defined)* margin | 2.6 and 3.8 percentage points |\n| Reduction in long-term growth rate       | 2.7 and 3.2 percentage points |\n| Increase in pre-tax discount rate        | 2.0 and 2.1 percentage points |\n\nThe average EBITDA (as defined)* margin for the aggregate of these two CGUs over the initial five-year period was 17.4%. The VIU (being the present value of the future net cash flows) was $2,474 million and the carrying amount was $1,960 million, resulting in an excess of value-in-use over carrying amounts of $514 million.\n\n* EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity\n\naccounted investments' profit after tax.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n212",

The following table sets out the gross carrying value of trade receivables and construction contract assets and expected credit loss allowance by segment:\n\n|                                                                    | Trade receivables and construction  contract assets, gross   | Trade receivables and construction  contract assets, gross   | Trade receivables and construction  contract assets, gross   | Expected credit loss allowance   | Expected credit loss allowance   | Expected credit loss allowance   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                    | 2022                                                         | 2021                                                         | 2020                                                         | 2022                             | 2021                             | 2020                             |\n|                                                                    | $m                                                           | $m                                                           | $m                                                           | $m                               | $m                               | $m                               |\n| Americas Materials                                                 | 1,764                                                        | 1,735                                                        | 1,475                                                        | 22                               | 27                               | 34                               |\n| Building Products (i)                                              | 914                                                          | 989                                                          | 830                                                          | 22                               | 25                               | 23                               |\n| Europe Materials                                                   | 1,363                                                        | 1,427                                                        | 1,403                                                        | 81                               | 79                               | 83                               |\n| Total Group                                                        | 4,041                                                        | 4,151                                                        | 3,708                                                        | 125                              | 131                              | 140                              |\n| (i)  Analysis of Building Products segment by geographic location: |                                                              |                                                              |                                                              |                                  |                                  |                                  |\n| Americas                                                           | 747                                                          | 821                                                          | 676                                                          | 16                               | 19                               | 17                               |\n| Europe                                                             | 167                                                          | 168                                                          | 154                                                          | 6                                | 6                                | 6                                |\n| Total                                                              | 914                                                          | 989                                                          | 830                                                          | 22                               | 25                               | 23                               |\n\nCustomer credit risk is managed according to established policies, procedures and controls. Customer credit quality is assessed in line with strict credit rating criteria and credit limits are established where appropriate. Outstanding customer balances are regularly monitored for evidence of customer financial difficulties including payment default, breach of contract, etc.\n\nSignificant balances are reviewed individually while smaller balances are grouped and assessed collectively. Receivables balances are in general unsecured and non-interest-bearing. Customer credit risk arising in the context of the Group's receivables is not significant and the total expected credit loss allowance for impairment of trade receivables and construction contract assets amounts to 3.1% of the Group's gross trade receivables and construction contract assets (2021: 3.2%). The Group considers the ageing of past due receivables a key factor in assessing credit risk. The trade receivables and construction contract assets balances disclosed above comprise a large number of customers spread across the Group's activities and geographies with balances classified as 'not past due' representing 69% of the total gross trade receivables and\n\nconstruction contract assets balance at the balance sheet date (2021: 68%). There have been no significant changes to the Group's credit risk parameters or to the composition of the Group's trade receivables and construction contract assets portfolio during the financial year.\n\nThe Group applies the simplified approach to providing for expected credit losses (ECL) permitted by IFRS 9 which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. Receivables such as those which relate to bonded government contracts and receivables which fall under credit insurance are considered lower risk and would not attract a material ECL. Considering the uncertain economic outlook for the next 12 months, our ECL allowance adequately represents the risk of default on our receivables balances.\n\nTrade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery, such as a debtor failing to engage in a repayment plan with the company. Where recoveries are made, these are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\n## Aged analysis\n\nThe aged analysis of net trade receivables and construction contract assets at the balance sheet date was as follows:\n\n|                                             | Americas  Materials 2022 $m   | Building  Products 2022 $m   | Europe  Materials 2022 $m   | Total 2022 $m   | Americas  Materials 2021 $m   | Building  Products 2021 $m   | Europe  Materials 2021 $m   | Total 2021 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|\n| Not past due                                | 1,225                         | 584                          | 988                         | 2,797           | 1,139                         | 626                          | 1,050                       | 2,815           |\n| Past due:                                   |                               |                              |                             |                 |                               |                              |                             |                 |\n| - less than 60 days                         | 415                           | 190                          | 218                         | 823             | 469                           | 227                          | 223                         | 919             |\n| - 60 days or greater but less than 120 days | 73                            | 76                           | 42                          | 191             | 74                            | 74                           | 44                          | 192             |\n| - 120 days or greater                       | 29                            | 42                           | 34                          | 105             | 26                            | 37                           | 31                          | 94              |\n| Total trade receivables, net                | 1,742                         | 892                          | 1,282                       | 3,916           | 1,708                         | 964                          | 1,348                       | 4,020           |\n\nTrade receivables and construction contract assets are in general receivable within 90 days of the balance sheet date.",

Analysis of Net Debt\n\n## Components of net debt\n\nNet debt comprises cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans and borrowings, lease liabilities and derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities; it enables investors to see the economic effects of these in total (see note 22 for details of the capital and risk management policies employed by the Group).

Capital and Financial Risk Management\n\n## Capital management\n\n## Overall summary\n\nThe primary objectives of CRH's capital management strategy are to ensure that the Group maintains a strong credit rating to support its business and to create shareholder value by managing the debt and equity balance and the cost of capital. The Group is committed to optimising the use of its balance sheet within the confines of the overall objective to maintain an investment grade credit rating.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group, which comprises net debt and capital and reserves attributable to the Company's equity holders, may be summarised as follows:\n\n|                                                                    | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Capital and reserves attributable to the Company's  equity holders | 21,691    | 20,233    |\n| Net debt                                                           | 5,105     | 6,253     |\n| Capital and net debt                                               | 26,796    | 26,486    |\n\nThe Board periodically reviews the capital structure of the Group, including the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group manages and, if necessary, adjusts its capital structure taking account of underlying economic conditions; any material adjustments to the Group's capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity are approved by the Board. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares, dispose of assets, amend investment plans, alter dividend policy or return capital to shareholders.\n\nDividend cover for the year ended 31 December 2022 amounted to 4x; on a continuing basis 2.8x (2021: 2.7x; on a continuing basis 2.5x; 2020: 1.2x; on a continuing basis 1.1x).\n\nNo changes were made in the objectives or policies during 2022.\n\n## Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe Group uses financial instruments throughout its businesses: interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and leases are used to finance the Group's operations; trade receivables and trade payables arise directly from operations; and derivatives, principally interest rate and currency swaps and currency forwards, are used to manage interest rate risks and currency exposures and to achieve the desired profile of borrowings.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority's announcement on 5 March 2021, LIBOR benchmark rates were discontinued after 31 December 2022 except for certain US Dollar settings which will be discontinued after 30 June 2023. Those rates that were discontinued were replaced by alternative riskfree rates (ARR) as part of the inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform.\n\nThe Group prepared an action plan, encompassing treasury, legal, accounting and IT functions, to enable a smooth transition to the alternative benchmark rates. The review identified a range of contracts that reference IBORs, including credit facilities, derivative instruments, money market deposits, lease agreements, and supply contract agreements. Action plans were developed for each of these arrangements to ensure a smooth transition to ARR. None of the changes had an impact on the Group's financing or interest rate hedging strategies, nor did they have a material financial impact.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the notional value of hedging instruments that reference 3-month US LIBOR is $1.4 billion. Whilst the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) benchmark rate has been widely adopted by market participants and effectively replaced US LIBOR in new contracts since 31 December 2022, a number of US LIBOR settings, including 3-month and 6-month US LIBOR, will continue to be published until 30 June 2023. Accordingly, absent any agreement with counterparties to transition to an ARR before this date, the Group's existing USD denominated interest rate swaps with maturity dates beyond 30 June 2023 will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases. As at 31 December 2022, the Group has not transitioned any of its existing USD denominated interest rate swaps to ARRs. The Group's other interest rate swaps reference EURIBOR rates and thus are not impacted by the IBOR reforms.\n\nThe Group does not trade in financial instruments nor does it enter into any leveraged derivative transactions.\n\nThe Group's corporate treasury function provides services to the business units, coordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group. The Group Treasurer reports to the Head of Group Finance and the activities of the corporate treasury function are subject to regular internal audit. Systems and processes are in place to monitor and control the Group's liquidity risks. The Group's net debt position forms part of the monthly documentation presented to the Board.\n\nThe Group's hedging activity is based on observable economic relationships, when there is confidence that such relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Matching critical terms such as notional amount, tenor, timing and currency, the Group establishes relationships between a hedged item and hedging instrument where directional response to changes in fair value, driven by underlying economic conditions, are opposing and proportional in equal measure being an economic relationship under IFRS 9. Hedging ratios of 1:1 are used throughout all hedging activity as the hedged item and hedging instrument are of the same type and currency. The hedges employed mitigate identified risks and have consistently demonstrated close economic relationships. Ineffectiveness between the hedged item and hedging instrument are immaterial in the overall context of the Group.\n\nThe main risks attaching to the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and commodity price risk. The Board reviews and agrees policies for the prudent management of each of these risks as documented below.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates stems predominantly from its long-term debt obligations. Interest cost is managed using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. With the objective of managing this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group enters into interest rate swaps, under which the Group contracts to exchange, at predetermined intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a pre-agreed notional principal. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt and the cash flow exposures of issued floating rate debt.\n\nThese swaps are designated under IFRS 9 to hedge underlying debt obligations and qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The Group issues fixed rate debt and may enter into interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n225",

        "page_content": "## 22. Capital and Financial Risk Management continued\n\nWhilst interest rate increases observed in the markets in which the Group operates were in the range of 2%-4.5% during 2022, the following table demonstrates the impact on profit before tax as a result of incremental changes of 1% in the interest rates applicable to floating rate net debt, which operate in a linear manner, with all other variables held constant. These impacts are calculated based on the closing balance sheet floating rate net debt for a full year and assume that all floating interest rates change by the same amount.\n\n| Percentage change in cost of borrowings (i)   |   +/-1% | +/-1%   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Impact on profit before tax                   |    2022 | +/-$38m |\n|                                               |    2021 | +/-$38m |\n|                                               |    2020 | +/-$59m |\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nDue to the nature of building materials, which in general have a low value-toweight ratio, the Group's activities are conducted primarily in the local currency of the country of operation resulting in low levels of foreign currency transaction risk; variances arising in this regard are reflected in operating costs or cost of sales in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they arise.\n\nGiven the Group's presence in 29 countries worldwide, the principal foreign exchange risk arises from fluctuations in the US Dollar value of the Group's net investment in a wide basket of currencies other than the US Dollar; such changes are reported separately within the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. A currency profile of the Group's net debt and net worth is presented in note 21. The Group's established policy is to spread its net worth across the currencies of its various operations with the objective of limiting its exposure to individual currencies and thus promoting consistency with the geographical balance of its operations. In order to achieve this objective, the Group manages its borrowings, where practicable and cost effective, to act as a natural foreign currency hedge of a portion of its foreign currency assets.\n\nThe Group's foreign exchange hedging strategy and activity is based on the assumption that changes in international economic factors are reflected in current foreign exchange rates and impact the translation of the Group's noneuro net assets (euro being the functional currency of the ultimate parent company). The economic relationship, being the translation impact of the Group's net investment in non-euro subsidiaries (hedged item) is hedged against a foreign currency swap (hedging instrument) to counterbalance movements in foreign currency rates. The Group identifies certain portions of foreign currency net investments where foreign currency translation movements can be mitigated through the use of currency swaps in the same currency pairing. A hedge ratio of 1:1 is established. As at 31 December 2022, the notional amount of hedged net investments was $1,145 million (2021: $726 million). The primary currency pairs in use are euro versus Canadian Dollar, Pound Sterling, Romanian Leu, Polish Zloty and Danish Kroner. The fair value movements of the hedging instruments are inverse to the impact of the translation of the hedged net assets because the critical terms match. This reduces the Group's exposure to fluctuations on the translation of the Group's subsidiaries with a non-euro functional currency into euro. Potential sources of ineffectiveness are changes in the interest rate differentials of the hedged currency pairs, recorded through the Consolidated Income Statement. Past trends indicate that the economic relationship described will continue for the foreseeable future. The fair values and maturity analysis of the hedging instruments are set out in note 25. Undesignated financial instruments are termed 'not designated as hedges'.\n\nWhilst foreign exchange volatility observed in the markets in which the Group operates was in the range of +/-10% during 2022, the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax and equity to incremental movements of 5% in the relevant US Dollar/euro exchange rate, which operate in a linear manner, with all other variables held constant. The euro has been selected as the appropriate currency for this analysis given the materiality of the Group's activities in euro. The impact on profit before tax is based on changing the US Dollar/euro exchange rate used in calculating profit before tax for the period. The impact on total equity and financial instruments is calculated by changing the US Dollar/euro exchange rate used in measuring the closing balance sheet.\n\nPercentage change in relevant $/\u20ac\n\n| exchange rate strengthening/weakening (i)                            |   +/- 5% | +/- 5%   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Impact on profit before tax                                          |     2022 | -/+$5m   |\n|                                                                      |     2021 | -/+$22m  |\n|                                                                      |     2020 | -/+ $19m |\n| Impact on total equity*                                              |     2022 | +/-$110m |\n|                                                                      |     2021 | +/-$123m |\n|                                                                      |     2020 | +/-$157m |\n| * Includes the impact on financial instruments  which is as follows: |     2022 | -/+$33m  |\n|                                                                      |     2021 | -/+$44m  |\n|                                                                      |     2020 | -/+$27m  |\n\nFinancial instruments include deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, bank loans, medium-term notes and other fixed term debt, interest rate swaps, commodity swaps and foreign exchange contracts. They exclude trade receivables and trade payables on the basis that they are denominated in the currency of the underlying operations. The Group minimises the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Group's income statement through matching where possible, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities or the use of derivative contracts at an entity level.\n\n## Credit/counterparty risk\n\nIn addition to cash at bank and in hand, the Group holds significant cash balances which are invested on a short-term basis and are classified as cash equivalents (see note 23). These deposits, investments and other financial instruments (principally certain derivatives and loans and receivables included within financial assets) give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparty financial institutions (stemming from their insolvency or a downgrade in their credit ratings). Credit risk is managed by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty primarily depending on its credit rating and by regular review of these ratings and internal treasury policies.\n\nAcceptable credit ratings for deposits and other financial instruments are higher investment-grade ratings-in general, counterparties have ratings of A3/A-/A- or higher from at least two of Moody's/ Standard & Poor's/Fitch ratings agencies. The maximum exposure arising in the event of default on the part of the counterparty (including insolvency) is the carrying value of the relevant financial instrument.\n\nCredit rating of counterparty (Moody's/Standard & Poor's/Fitch)\n\n|                       | As at 31 December 2022   | As at 31 December 2022   | As at 31 December 2021   | As at 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                       | $m                       | %                        | $m                       | %                        |\n| Aaa/AAA/AAA           | 279                      | 5%                       | 2,021                    | 35%                      |\n| Aa/AA/AA              | 2,194                    | 37%                      | 2,394                    | 41%                      |\n| A/A/A                 | 3,199                    | 54%                      | 1,216                    | 21%                      |\n| Baa/BBB/BBB  or lower | 264                      | 4%                       | 152                      | 3 %                      |\n|                       | 5,936                    | 100%                     | 5,783                    | 100%                     |\n\nMoney market liquidity funds are managed by external third-party fund managers to maintain Aaa/AAA long-term ratings and P1/A1 short-term ratings from Moody's/Standard & Poor's. The Group limits its investment in each fund to a prescribed maximum amount or 5% of the fund's assets under management, whichever is the lower. The Group has a number of managed investment funds that hold fixed income euro securities with an average credit quality of Aaa/AAA. As at 31 December 2022, 95% (2021: 65%) of cash and cash equivalents was held with higher investment grade bank counterparties, and 5% (2021: 35%) with the money market funds.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n226",

        "page_content": "Credit risk arising in the context of the Group's operations is not significant with the total loss allowance at the balance sheet date amounting to 3.1% of gross trade receivables and construction contract assets (2021: 3.2%). Information in relation to the Group's credit risk management of trade receivables is provided in note 17. Amounts receivable from related parties (notes 17 and 32) are immaterial. Factoring arrangements and supplier financing arrangements are employed in certain of the Group's operations where deemed to be of benefit by operational management and are deemed immaterial.\n\nIn its worldwide insurance programme, the Group carries appropriate levels of insurance for typical business risks (including product liability) with various leading insurance companies. However, in the event of the failure of one or more of its insurance counterparties, the Group could be impacted by losses where recovery from such counterparties is not possible.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe principal liquidity risks faced by the Group stem from the maturation of debt obligations and derivative transactions. A downgrade of CRH's credit ratings may give rise to increases in funding costs in respect of future debt and may impair the Group's ability to raise funds on acceptable terms. The Group's corporate treasury function ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet such liabilities as they fall due through a combination of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows and undrawn committed bank facilities. Flexibility in funding sources is achieved through a variety of means including (i) maintaining cash and cash equivalents only with a diverse group of highly-rated counterparties; (ii) limiting the annual maturity of such balances; (iii) borrowing the bulk of the Group's debt requirements under committed bank lines or other term financing; and (iv) having surplus committed lines of credit.\n\nThe undrawn committed facilities available to the Group as at the balance sheet date are quantified in note 24; these facilities span a wide number of highly-rated financial institutions thus minimising any potential exposure arising from concentrations in borrowing sources. The repayment schedule (analysed by maturity date) applicable to the Group's outstanding interest-bearing loans and borrowings as at the balance sheet date is also presented in note 24.\n\nThe Group's \u20ac1.5 billion Euro Commercial Paper Programme and $2.0 billion US Dollar Commercial Paper Programme means we have framework programmes in place in the money markets that allow the Group to issue in the relevant markets within a short period of time.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n227\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe principal commodity price risks are identified in a variety of highly probable and active commodity contracts where a significant part of the price to be paid relies on a reference to specific floating price indices (usually US Dollar) for a specific period. Programmes are in place to hedge the quantities and qualities of commodity products, including fuel oil and related products, electricity and carbon credits. The aim of the programmes is to neutralise the variability in the Consolidated Income Statement as a result of changes in associated commodity indices over a timeframe of approximately two years (2021: four years). A hedge ratio of 1:1 is established. Fixed price swap contracts in the entity's operating currency are used to hedge the same specific floating index risk and currency risk where it is determined that those risks are better managed at a fixed price rather than being exposed to uncontrollable price fluctuations due to the floating price index element of the contract. Sources of ineffectiveness can relate to timing of cash flows and counterparty credit risk adjustments. The derivative contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under IFRS 9 and the fair values by maturity are set out in note 25.\n\nThe notional and fair values in respect of derivative contracts as at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 were as follows:\n\n## Profile of commodity products\n\n|                                | As at 31 December 2022   | As at 31 December 2022   | As at 31 December 2021   | As at 31 December 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                | Notional  value $m       | Fair value $m            | Notional  value $m       | Fair value $m            |\n| Carbon credits                 | 435                      | (30)                     | 10                       | -                        |\n| Electricity                    | 11                       | 20                       | 12                       | 6                        |\n| Fuel oil and related  products | 94                       | (10)                     | 64                       | 26                       |\n|                                | 540                      | (20)                     | 86                       | 32                       |",

Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents balances are spread across a wide number of highly-rated financial institutions. The credit risk attaching to these items is documented in note 22. Cash and cash equivalents are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are analysed as follows:\n\n|                                   | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand          | 873       | 925       |\n| Investments (short-term deposits) | 5,063     | 4,858     |\n| Total                             | 5,936     | 5,783     |\n\nCash at bank earns/pays interest at floating rates based on daily deposit bank rates. Short-term deposits, which include bank and money market deposits, are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, earning interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.\n\nMoney market deposits are held at fair value through profit and loss and are Level 1 instruments. The fair values of money market deposits are calculated by multiplying the net asset value per share by the investment held at the balance sheet date.\n\n## 24.

Revolving committed bank facilities are generally available to the Group for periods of up to five years from the date of inception. The undrawn committed facilities figures shown in the table above represent the facilities available to be drawn by the Group at 31 December 2022.\n\nIn September 2022 the Group repaid a CHF 330 million bond upon maturity. A positive translation adjustment of $0.3 billion and a reduction in cumulative fair value hedge adjustment of $0.2 billion further reduced the bond balance.\n\nAt the end of 2021 a number of LIBOR settings ceased to be published (including Sterling and Swiss Franc), while certain US Dollar LIBOR settings will continue to be provided until June 2023. There is no change to the publication of EURIBOR rates. The Group's syndicated revolving credit facility (undrawn as at 31 December 2022) previously referenced USD LIBOR, GBP LIBOR and CHF LIBOR rates. During 2021 the Group negotiated with its Lenders, amendments to the facility to include market standard LIBOR replacement language. From 1 January 2022 the agreement adopted the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) and Swiss Average Rate\n\nOvernight (SARON) as the alternative benchmark rates in respect of USD, GBP and CHF LIBOR rates respectively.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nThe Company has given letters of guarantee to secure obligations of subsidiary undertakings as follows: $9.3 billion in respect of loans and borrowings, bank advances and derivative obligations (2021: $10.0 billion) and $0.4 billion in respect of letters of credit due within one year (2021: $0.4 billion).\n\nAny Irish registered wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company may avail of the exemption from filing its statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 as permitted by section 357 of the Companies Act 2014 and if an Irish registered wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company elects to avail of this exemption, there will be in force an irrevocable guarantee from the Company in respect of all commitments entered into by such wholly-owned subsidiary, including amounts shown as liabilities (within the meaning of section 357 (1) (b) of the Companies Act 2014) in such wholly-owned subsidiary's statutory financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.",

The amount of tax losses where recovery is not probable and is therefore not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is $1.2 billion (2021: $1.2 billion). The vast majority either do not expire based on current tax legislation or they expire post 2027 (2021: 2026). Of the losses not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, $0.1 billion (2021: $0.1 billion) expire within five years, $0.2 billion (2021: $0.4 billion) expire post five years and the remainder of losses do not expire.\n\n## Deferred income tax liabilities (taxable temporary differences)\n\nTaxable temporary differences principally attributable to accelerated tax depreciation and fair value adjustments arising\n\n| on acquisition (i)                                            | 3,312   | 3,218   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Leased right-of-use assets                                    | 250     | 314     |\n| Investment in subsidiaries                                    | 159     | 164     |\n| Surpluses on Group retirement benefit schemes                 | 30      | 9       |\n| Revaluation of derivative financial instruments to fair value | 10      | 15      |\n| Rolled-over capital gains                                     | 20      | 22      |\n| Total                                                         | 3,781   | 3,742   |\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe aggregate temporary differences in relation to investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is $14.5 billion (2021: $12.1 billion) given the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal and management's intention not to unwind these temporary differences. Participation exemptions and tax credits are available in the majority of jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

        "page_content": "## 28. Retirement Benefit Obligations\n\nThe Group operates either defined benefit or defined contribution pension schemes in all of its principal operating areas. The disclosures included below relate to all pension schemes in the Group.\n\nThe Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland, the UK and the US. The Group also operated a defined benefit pension scheme in Brazil which was divested in April 2021. The Group has a mixture of funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes. The net surplus of the funded schemes is $221 million (2021: $54 million). Unfunded obligations (including jubilee, post-retirement healthcare obligations and long-term service commitments) comprise of a number of schemes in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland and the US, totalling a net liability of $237 million (2021: $363 million).\n\nFunded defined benefit schemes in the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland and the UK are administered by separate funds that are legally distinct from the Group under the jurisdiction of Trustees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the best interests of the scheme participants and are responsible for the definition of investment strategy and for scheme administration. Other schemes are also administered in line with the local regulatory environment. The level of benefits available to most members depends on length of service and either their average salary over their period of employment or their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. For Switzerland, the level of benefits depends on salary, level of savings contributions, the interest rate on old age accounts (which cannot be negative) and the annuity conversion factor on retirement. The Group's pension schemes in Switzerland are contribution-based schemes with guarantees to provide further contributions in the event that the plan assets are insufficient to meet the benefit obligations.\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes - principal risks\n\nThrough its defined benefit pension and jubilee schemes, long-term service commitments and post-retirement healthcare plans, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:\n\nAsset volatility : Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits , the assets of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes are reported at fair value (using bid prices, where relevant). The majority of the schemes' assets comprise equities, bonds and property, all of which may fluctuate significantly in value from period to period including from fluctuations arising in respect of climate change and associated risks and uncertainties. Given that liabilities are discounted to present value based on bond yields and that bond prices are inversely related to yields, an increase in the liability discount rate (which would reduce liabilities) would reduce bond values, though not necessarily by an equal magnitude.\n\n## Financial assumptions - scheme liabilities\n\nThe major long-term assumptions used by the Group's actuaries in the computation of scheme liabilities and post-retirement healthcare obligations are as follows:\n\n|                         | United States   | United States   | United States   | United States   | United States   | United States   | United States   | United States   | United States   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n|                         | Eurozone        | Eurozone        | Eurozone        | and Canada      | and Canada      | and Canada      | Switzerland     | Switzerland     | Switzerland     |\n|                         | 2022            | 2021            | 2020            | 2022            | 2021            | 2020            | 2022            | 2021            | 2020            |\n|                         | %               | %               | %               | %               | %               | %               | %               | %               | %               |\n| Rate of increase in:    |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |\n| - salaries              | 3.30            | 2.92            | 2.52            | 3.00            | 3.03            | 3.37            | 2.50            | 1.25            | 1.00            |\n| - pensions in payment   | 2.10            | 1.90            | 1.45            | -               | -               | -               | -               | -               | -               |\n| Inflation               | 2.30            | 1.90            | 1.50            | 2.10            | 2.00            | 2.00            | 2.00            | 0.75            | 0.50            |\n| Discount rate           | 4.20            | 1.43            | 1.14            | 5.20            | 2.82            | 2.34            | 2.20            | 0.30            | 0.20            |\n| Medical cost trend rate | n/a             | n/a             | n/a             | 1.87            | 5.91            | 5.97            | n/a             | n/a             | n/a             |\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n234\n\nGiven the maturity of certain of the Group's funded defined benefit pension schemes, de-risking frameworks have been introduced to mitigate deficit volatility and enable better matching of investment returns with the cash outflows related to benefit obligations. These frameworks entail the usage of asset-liability matching techniques, whereby triggers are set for the conversion of equity holdings into bonds of similar average duration to the relevant liabilities.\n\nDiscount rates : The discount rates employed in determining the present value of the schemes' liabilities are determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the associated post-employment benefit obligations. Changes in discount rates impact the quantum of liabilities as discussed above.\n\nInflation risk : A significant amount of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation; higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect the schemes against extreme inflation).\n\nLongevity risk : In the majority of cases, the Group's defined benefit pension schemes provide benefits for life with spousal and dependent child reversionary provisions; increases in life expectancy (decreases in mortality assumptions) will therefore give rise to higher liabilities.\n\n## Aggregation\n\nFor the purposes of the disclosures which follow; the schemes in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Slovakia have been aggregated into a 'Eurozone' category on the basis of common currency and financial assumptions; schemes in Brazil (which was divested in April 2021), the Philippines, Romania, Serbia and the UK have been aggregated into an 'Other' category.",

Retirement Benefit Obligations continued\n\n## Actuarial valuations - funding requirements and future cash flows\n\nIn accordance with statutory requirements in the Republic of Ireland and funding requirements set by the Trustees in the UK, additional annual contributions and lump-sum payments are determined to get the plans to a fully funded position (on a funding basis). The funding requirements in relation to the Group's defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent and qualified actuaries and valuations are prepared in this regard either annually, where local requirements mandate that this be done, or at triennial intervals at a\n\nmaximum in all other cases. In the Republic of Ireland and the UK, either the attained age or projected unit credit methods are used in the valuations. In Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the US, valuations are performed in accordance with the projected unit credit methodology. The dates of the funding valuations range from January 2020 to March 2022.\n\nIn general, funding valuations are not available for public inspection; however, the results of valuations are advised to the members of the various schemes on request.\n\nThe Group has contracted payments (presented on a discounted basis) to certain schemes in the UK as follows:\n\n|                              |   2022 $m |   2021 $m |   2020 $m |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Within one year              |         3 |         2 |         2 |\n| Between one and two years    |         3 |         2 |         2 |\n| Between two and three years  |         3 |         2 |         2 |\n| Between three and four years |         3 |         2 |         2 |\n| Between four and five years  |         2 |         2 |         2 |\n| After five years             |         9 |         7 |        10 |\n| Total                        |        23 |        17 |        20 |\n\nEmployer contributions payable in the 2023 financial year including minimum funding payments (expressed using year-end exchange rates for 2022) are estimated at $37 million.\n\n## Average duration and scheme composition\n\n|                                                          | Eurozone   | Eurozone   | Eurozone   | United States and Canada   | United States and Canada   | United States and Canada   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   | Switzerland   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                          | 2022       | 2021       | 2020       | 2022                       | 2021                       | 2020                       | 2022          | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Average duration of defined benefit obligation (years)   | 14.0       | 18.3       | 18.3       | 10.2                       | 12.3                       | 12.9                       | 13.5          | 17.0          | 17.6          |\n| Allocation of defined benefit obligation by participant: |            |            |            |                            |                            |                            |               |               |               |\n| Active plan participants                                 | 70%        | 69%        | 70%        | 47%                        | 49%                        | 43%                        | 76%           | 74%           | 74%           |\n| Deferred plan participants                               | 10%        | 10%        | 10%        | 15%                        | 15%                        | 12%                        | -%            | - %           | - %           |\n| Retirees                                                 | 20%        | 21%        | 20%        | 38%                        | 36%                        | 45%                        | 24%           | 26%           | 26%           |\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n238",

In 2022 the appropriation was satisfied by the purchase of 149,426 shares (2021: 124,960 satisfied by the purchase of shares). The Ordinary Shares appropriated pursuant to these schemes were issued at market value on the dates of appropriation.

Business Combinations continued\n\nThe acquisition balance sheet presented on the previous page reflects the identifiable net assets acquired in respect of acquisitions completed during 2022, together with adjustments to provisional fair values in respect of acquisitions completed during 2021. The measurement period for a number of acquisitions completed in 2021, closed in 2022 with no material adjustments identified.\n\nCRH performs a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of each acquisition in order to determine whether it is material for the purposes of separate disclosure under IFRS 3 Business Combinations . The acquisition of Barrette is deemed to be a material acquisition. None of the remaining acquisitions completed during the financial year were considered sufficiently material to warrant separate disclosure of the attributable fair values. Due to the size and scale of the Barrette acquisition, the determination of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as disclosed above are provisional (principally in respect of property, plant and equipment, provisions for liabilities and the associated goodwill and deferred tax aspects). The fair value assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is based on estimates and assumptions made by management at the time of acquisition. CRH may revise its purchase price allocation during the subsequent reporting window as permitted under IFRS 3.\n\n- (i) Marketing-related, customer-related and contract-based intangible assets of $174 million, $594 million and $41 million respectively arose on the acquisition of Barrette. These primarily related to brand names, patents and non-contractual customer relationships. Due to the asset-intensive nature of operations in the Americas Materials and Europe Materials business segments, no significant separately identifiable intangible assets were recognised on business combinations in these segments.\n\n|                    | Gross contractual amounts due   | Gross contractual amounts due   | Gross contractual amounts due   | Loss   | Loss   | Loss   | Fair value   | Fair value   | Fair value   |\n|--------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                    | 2022                            | 2021                            | 2020                            | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2022         | 2021         | 2020         |\n|                    | $m                              | $m                              | $m                              | $m     | $m     | $m     | $m           | $m           | $m           |\n| Barrette           | 169                             | -                               | -                               | 1      | -      | -      | 168          | -            | -            |\n| Other acquisitions | 60                              | 192                             | 47                              | 1      | 1      | -      | 59           | 191          | 47           |\n| Total              | 229                             | 192                             | 47                              | 2      | 1      | -      | 227          | 191          | 47           |\n\n| Acquisition-related costs   |   2022 $m | 2021 $m   | 2020 $m   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Barrette                    |        27 | -         | -         |\n| Other acquisitions          |        12 | 13        | 6         |\n| Total                       |        39 | 13        | 6         |\n\nThe above acquisition-related costs, which exclude post-acquisition integration costs, have been included in operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement (note 4).",

The Group's principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are disclosed on pages 290 to 293.\n\nSales to and purchases from joint ventures and associates are as follows:\n\n|                       | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Joint ventures   | Associates   | Associates   | Associates   |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                       | 2022             | 2021             | 2020             | 2022         | 2021         | 2020         |\n| Continuing operations | $m               | $m               | $m               | $m           | $m           | $m           |\n| Sales                 | 192              | 157              | 127              | 45           | 42           | 31           |\n| Purchases             | 41               | 29               | 24               | 20           | 19           | 15           |\n\nLoans extended by the Group to joint ventures and associates (see note 15) are included in financial assets.

Bank overdrafts are included within creditors falling due within one year in the Company Balance Sheet.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, are stated at cost less any accumulated impairment and are reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessment is considered as part of the Group's overall impairment assessment.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of the Company is euro. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange in effect at the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, with a corresponding charge or credit to the profit and loss account.\n\nThe presentation currency of the Company is the US Dollar.\n\n## Loans receivable and payable\n\nIntercompany loans receivable and payable are initially recognised at fair value.

A financial liability is recorded if a contractual obligation to repurchase shares exists at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Own shares\n\nOrdinary Shares purchased by the Employee Benefit Trust on behalf of the Company under the terms of the Performance Share Plan are recorded as a deduction from equity on the face of the Company Balance Sheet.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends on Ordinary Shares are recognised as a liability in the Company's Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company and approved by shareholders in respect of final dividends.\n\n## Dividend income\n\nDividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.\n\n## Operating income and expense\n\nOperating income and expense arises from the Company's principal activities as a holding and financing company for the Group and are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n250",

        "page_content": "## Non-GAAP Performance Measures continued\n\nEBITDA (as defined)* EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity accounted investments' profit after tax and is quoted by management in conjunction with other GAAP and non -GAAP financial measures, to aid investors in their analysis of the performance of the Group and to assist investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies. EBITDA (as defined)* by segment is monitored by management in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Given that net finance costs and income tax are managed on a centralised basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purpose of the information presented to the Chief Operating Decision Maker. EBITDA (as defined)* margin is calculated by expressing EBITDA (as defined)* as a percentage of sales.\n\nNet Debt. Net debt is used by management as it gives additional insight into the Group's current debt situation less available cash. Net debt is provided to enable investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Net debt is a non -GAAP measure and comprises current and non -current interest -bearing loans and borrowings, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and current and non -current derivative financial instruments (net).\n\nNet Debt/EBITDA (as defined)* is monitored by management and is useful to investors in assessing the Company's level of indebtedness relative to its profitability. It is the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (as defined)* and is calculated on page 259.\n\nRONA. Return on Net Assets is a key internal pre -tax and pre -non -cash impairment measure of operating performance throughout the CRH Group and can be used by management and investors to measure the relative use of assets between CRH's business segments and to compare to other businesses. The metric measures management's ability to generate profits from the net assets required to support that business, focusing on both profit maximisation and the maintenance of an efficient asset base; it encourages effective fixed asset maintenance programmes, good decisions regarding expenditure on property, plant and equipment and the timely disposal of surplus assets, and also supports the effective management of the Group's working capital base. RONA is calculated by expressing Group operating profit from continuing operations and Group operating profit from discontinued operations excluding non -cash impairment charges as a percentage of average net assets. Net assets comprise total assets by segment (including assets held for sale) less total liabilities by segment (excluding lease liabilities and including liabilities associated with assets classified as held for sale) as shown on page 258 and detailed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and excludes equity accounted investments and other financial assets, net debt (as previously defined) and tax assets & liabilities. The average net assets for the year is the simple average of the opening and closing balance sheet figures.\n\n## Organic Revenue, Organic Operating Profit and Organic EBITDA (as defined)*\n\nCRH pursues a strategy of growth through acquisitions and investments, with $3.3 billion spent on acquisitions and investments in 2022 (2021: $1.5 billion). Acquisitions completed in 2021 and 2022 contributed incremental sales revenue of $1,739 million, operating profit of $275 million and EBITDA (as defined)* of $402 million in 2022. Cash proceeds from divestments and non -current asset disposals amounted to $3.9 billion (net of cash disposed and including deferred consideration proceeds in respect of prior year divestments (2021: $507 million). The sales impact of divested activities in 2022 was a negative $108 million and the impact at an operating profit and EBITDA (as defined)* level was a negative $13 million and $17million respectively.\n\nThe US Dollar strengthened against most major currencies during 2022 resulting in the average US Dollar/euro rate strengthening from 0.8460 in 2021 to 0.9518 in 2022 and likewise the US Dollar/Pound Sterling rate strengthening from an average of 0.7270 in 2021 to 0.8120 in 2022. Overall currency movements resulted in an unfavourable net foreign currency translation impact on our results as shown in the table on page 63. The average and year end 2022 exchange rates of the major currencies impacting on the Group are set out on page 190.\n\n*   EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity\n\naccounted investments' profit after tax.\n\nBecause of the impact of acquisitions, divestments, exchange translation and other non -recurring items on reported results each year, the Group uses organic revenue, organic operating profit and organic EBITDA (as defined)* as additional performance indicators to assess performance of pre -existing (also referred to as underlying, heritage, like -for -like or ongoing) operations each year.\n\nOrganic revenue, organic operating profit and organic EBITDA (as defined)* are arrived at by excluding the incremental revenue, operating profit and EBITDA (as defined)* contributions from current and prior year acquisitions and divestments, the impact of exchange translation, the impact of impairment and the impact of any one-off items. In the Business Performance section on pages 60 to 79, changes in organic revenue, organic operating profit and organic EBITDA (as defined)* are presented as additional measures of revenue, operating profit and EBITDA (as defined)* to provide a greater understanding of the performance of the Group. Organic change % is calculated by expressing the organic movement as a percentage of the prior year (adjusted for exchange effects). A reconciliation of the changes in organic revenue, organic operating profit and organic EBITDA (as defined)* to the changes in total revenue, operating profit and EBITDA (as defined)* for the Group and by segment, is presented with the discussion of each segment's performance in tables contained in the segment discussion commencing on page 60.\n\nRevenue from products with enhanced sustainability attributes (i.e., excluding contracting, distribution, and other services) is defined as product revenue derived from those products that incorporate any, or a combination of; recycled materials; are produced using alternative energy and fuel sources; have a lowercarbon footprint as compared to those produced using traditional manufacturing processes; and/or are designed to specifically benefit the environment (i.e. water treatment and management systems, products with strong thermal mass/Uvalues). This measure as calculated on page 259 is monitored by management and is an aid to investors in their analysis of the performance of the Group and their understanding of how much of the product revenue of the Group meets any of these attributes.\n\nCash paid to Shareholders. Cash paid to shareholders is a measure of cash returned to shareholders representing dividends of $0.9 billion (2021: $0.9 billion) paid during the year and excess cash of $1.2 billion (2021: $0.9 billion) returned through the share buyback programme. The metric provides information on dividend growth for shareholders and is reflective of CRH's continued commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. CRH monitors the cash paid to shareholders as part of its overall capital allocation strategy.\n\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR). TSR is a measure of shareholder returns delivery through the cycle. It represents the total accumulated value delivered to shareholders since the formation of the Group in 1970 (via gross dividends reinvested and share appreciation) and is calculated on page 259. The metric provides information on total returns for shareholders and is provided to assist investors in the comparison of the Group's performance with that of other companies.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n260",

These reserves and resources are found within our extensive network of quarry locations in attractive local markets globally. This disclosure of the Group's mining properties has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K ('Subpart 1300'). The Group has 1,235 properties with 90,293 hectares of owned and 38,613 hectares of leased land, respectively, as disclosed in the table on page 265, the locations of which are presented by geographic location in the maps on pages 266 to 267.\n\nNone of CRH's mineral -bearing properties are individually material to the Group as at 31 December 2022. A summary disclosure of CRH's mining operations is provided on pages 263 to 267.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group's reserves and resources estimations of 22.8 billion tonnes and 9.8 billion tonnes, respectively, as disclosed on pages 263 to 264, are calculated in accordance with Subpart 1300. The Group's reserves and resources disclosures may not be comparable to similar disclosures disclosed in accordance with the requirements of other countries and should be read in conjunction with the disclosures that follow on pages 263 to 267.\n\nCRH operates predominantly production stage properties, with a limited number of development and exploration stage properties, as such terms are defined in Subpart 1300. Predominantly, CRH's production stage properties provide raw materials for on-site modern cement, lime and aggregates producing facilities. Almost exclusively, CRH utilises surface mining and, with a very limited number of exceptions, CRH and its subsidiaries are the only operators of the properties.\n\n## Reserves\n\nReserves are defined in Subpart 1300 as 'an estimate of tonnage and grade or quality of indicated and measured mineral resources that, in the opinion of the qualified person, can be the basis of an economically viable project. More specifically, it is the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource, which includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined or extracted'. Reserves are classified into two categories, probable and proven reserves, in order of increasing geological confidence.\n\nThe Group's estimate of 22.8 billion tonnes of reserves, as disclosed on page 263 analysed by rock type (Hard rock, Sand & Gravel and Other), are of recoverable stone, sand, and gravel of suitable quality for economic extraction, based on drilling and studies by the Group's geologists and engineers. These estimates also consider reasonable economic and operating constraints as to maximum depth of overburden and stone excavation and are subject to permitting or other restrictions.\n\nThe disclosed reserves and resources estimations which include diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the mineral is mined, extracted or processed have been estimated by qualified persons, as such term is defined within Subpart 1300.\n\nNot all minerals that may be on CRH's mineral-bearing properties have been assessed and such properties may be assessed for mineral reserves or resources in future years, as required by operational needs.\n\nCRH's properties are subject to a wide variety of permitting procedures and conditions, which vary between jurisdictions. Many of CRH's properties require separate permits from multiple authorities, including but not limited to environmental, mining, regional and national administrative authorities. The periods of validity and the conditions of these permits may be different.\n\n## Resources\n\nA mineral resource is defined in Subpart 1300 as \"a concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth's crust in such form, grade or quality, and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for economic extraction. A mineral resource is a reasonable estimate of mineralisation, taking into account relevant factors such as cut-off grade, likely mining dimensions, location or continuity, that, with the assumed and justifiable technical and economic conditions, is likely to, in whole or in part, become economically extractable\". Resources are classified into three categories, inferred, indicated or\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n262\n\nmeasured resources, in order of increasing geological confidence. Indicated or measured resources can be converted to reserves by the application of certain modifying factors which include, but are not limited to, consideration of mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental compliance, plans, negotiations, or agreements with local individuals or groups, and governmental factors. There is no certainty that any of the resources disclosed on page 264 will be converted into reserves. Resources have not been fully assessed using modifying factors, however, an initial assessment has been completed in accordance with Subpart 1300.\n\n## Internal Controls\n\nCRH has established appropriate governance processes to support the publication of our 2022 reserves and resources disclosures, reserve and resource estimates are subject to annual review by each of the relevant operating companies across the Group in conjunction with the relevant qualified persons. CRH has established and maintains a number of internal controls to address the risks inherent in the mineral reserves and resources reporting process. These internal controls have been embedded into the local control environments and operate across the business, including controls at an Operating Company, Divisional and Group level.\n\nAs CRH's reserves and resources are predominantly in production stage properties, features of the internal controls relating to quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) include:\n\n- \u00b7 Databases and data repositories for exploration and/or production data that contain accurate and precise data from which reserves and resources can be evaluated, and operational plans can be developed;\n- \u00b7 Verification sampling and testing of known mineralisation. This is generally required to establish compliance with regulation on product qualities. Verification testing confirms geological maps prepared during earlier exploration programmes; and\n- \u00b7 In the case of cement raw materials, facility laboratories participate in an externally managed annual review process with ISO 17025 accredited independent laboratories\n\nWhen exploration programmes are conducted, QA/QC measures include:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring that surface or drill sampling results in the highest quality sample possible. This would include down-hole surveying of drill holes as necessary;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining pictures of drill sample (e.g. core) for future reference;\n- \u00b7 Geological core logging prior to laboratory analysis. Description of sample at various intervals;\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the integrity of samples from point of origin to analytical laboratory; and\n- \u00b7 Using nationally or regionally accredited laboratories for all analyses and tests for exploration programmes in properties containing aggregates\n\nIn addition, to provide further assurance over the Group's mineral reserves and resources reporting process, the Group's Internal Audit function completed a limited scope review across a sample of material reporting entities on the operation of these internal controls as at 31 December 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Property, Plants and Equipment\n\nAt 17 February 2023, CRH had a total of 3,159 building materials production locations. 1,043 locations are leased, with the remaining 2,116 locations held on a freehold basis. The significant subsidiary locations as at 31 December 2022 are the cement facilities in the US, Philippines, Poland, Ukraine, the UK, Romania, Canada, Ireland, Slovakia and France. The clinker (the key intermediate product in the manufacture of cement) capacity for these locations is set out in the table below. Further details on locations and products manufactured are provided on pages 294 and 295. None of CRH's individual properties is of material significance to the Group.\n\nCRH believes that all the facilities are in good condition, adequate for their purpose and suitably utilised according to the individual nature and requirements of the relevant operations. CRH has a continuing programme of improvements and replacements to properties when considered appropriate to meet the needs of the individual operations. Further information in relation to the Group's accounting policy and process governing any impairment of property, plant and equipment is given on page 182 and in note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 208.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n268\n\n## Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nCRH generally owns or leases the real estate on which its main raw materials, namely aggregates, are found. CRH is a significant purchaser of certain important materials or resources such as cement, bitumen, steel, gas, fuel and other energy supplies, the cost of which can fluctuate significantly and consequently have an adverse impact on CRH's business. CRH is not generally dependent on any one source for the supply of these materials or resources, other than in certain jurisdictions with regard to the supply of gas and electricity. Competitive markets generally exist in the jurisdictions in which CRH operates for the supply of cement, bitumen, steel and fuel.\n\n## Mine Safety Disclosures\n\nThe information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd -Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is included in Exhibit 16 to CRH's Annual Report on Form 20 -F, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\n## Significant Locations - Clinker Capacity\n\n| Subsidiary           | Country        |   Number of plants | Clinker capacity  (tonnes per hour)   |\n|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Ash Grove            | United States  |                 10 | 1,169                                 |\n| Republic Cement      | Philippines    |                  5 | 628                                   |\n| Grupa O\u017car\u00f3w         | Poland         |                  1 | 342                                   |\n| Podilsky Cement PJSC | Ukraine        |                  1 | 325                                   |\n| Tarmac               | United Kingdom |                  3 | 306                                   |\n| ROMCIM               | Romania        |                  2 | 305                                   |\n| Ash Grove            | Canada         |                  2 | 288                                   |\n| Irish Cement         | Ireland        |                  2 | 288                                   |\n| Danucem              | Slovakia       |                  2 | 277                                   |\n| Eqiom                | France         |                  3 | 243                                   |",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Practices\n\n## Compliance Statement\n\nNon -US companies such as CRH are exempt from most of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. In common with companies listed on the LSE and Euronext Dublin, CRH's corporate governance practices reflect, inter alia, compliance with (a) domestic company law; (b) the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Euronext Dublin; and (c) the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, which is appended to the listing rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin.\n\nThe Board of CRH has adopted a robust set of governance principles, which reflect the 2018 Code and its principles -based approach to corporate governance. Accordingly, the way in which CRH makes determinations of Directors' independence differs from the NYSE rules. The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non -executive Directors are independent. In doing so the Board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards. However, the Board has determined that all of the non-executive Directors on the Audit Committee are independent according to the requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Further, CRH considers that the Terms of Reference for its Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee are generally responsive to the relevant NYSE rules, but may not address all aspects of such rules.\n\n## Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\n\nThe NYSE rules require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity -compensation plans and material revisions to those plans with certain limited exceptions. CRH complies with Irish requirements, which are similar to the NYSE rules. The Board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed definition on what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for monitoring the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems to the Audit Committee 1 . Such systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and, in the case of internal control systems, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared subject to oversight and control of the Chief Financial Officer, who seeks to ensure that data is captured from Group locations and all required information for disclosure in the Consolidated Financial Statements is provided. An appropriate control framework has been put in place around the recording of appropriate consolidation journals and other adjustments. The Consolidated Financial Statements are reviewed by the internal CRH Financial Reporting and Disclosure Group prior to being reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer and Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nGroup management has responsibility for major strategic development and financing decisions. Responsibility for operational issues is devolved, subject to limits of authority, to product group and operating company management. Management at all levels is responsible for internal control over the business functions that have been delegated. This embedding of the system of internal control throughout the Group's operations is designed to enable the organisation to respond quickly to evolving business risks, and to ensure that significant internal control issues, should they arise, are reported promptly to appropriate levels of management.\n\n## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Rule 13a-15 of the US Securities Exchange Act, the following report is provided by management in respect of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. As defined by the SEC, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company's Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the\n\n- 1. In accordance with Section 167(7) of the Companies Act 2014.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n269\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n- \u00b7 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and Directors of the Company; and\n- \u00b7 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our Company's published Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes under generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with the preparation of the Company's annual Consolidated Financial Statements, management has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in the Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nAs permitted by the SEC, the Company has elected following a qualitative and quantitative review to exclude an assessment of the internal controls of the material acquisition made during the year 2022, being Barrette. The acquisition of Barrette represented 3.4% and 5.0% of total and net Group assets, respectively, and 1.1% of Group revenue. Its loss reduced Group profit by less than 1.0% for the financial year then ended.\n\nManagement's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this assessment, management has concluded and hereby reports that as of 31 December 2022, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective. Our auditor, Deloitte, a registered public accounting firm, who have audited the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, have audited the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. Their report, on which an unqualified opinion is expressed thereon, is included on page 175.\n\n## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nDuring 2022, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the period covered by this Annual Report and Form 20 -F that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nManagement has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of 31 December 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date at the level of providing reasonable assurance.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, recognised that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the cost -benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.",

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy\n\n## Compliance Statement\n\nThe EU Taxonomy regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) is part of the EU's overall efforts to implement the European Green Deal. It is intended to serve as a standardised and mandatory classification system to determine which economic activities are considered as 'environmentally sustainable' by the EU.\n\nIn June 2021, the European Commission formally adopted the Climate Delegated Act with its Annexes, establishing the Technical Screening Criteria that define which activities substantially contribute to the first two, out of six, environmental objectives of the EU Taxonomy regulation, namely climate change mitigation (Annex I), and climate change adaptation (Annex II). The Technical Screening Criteria for the remaining four environmental objectives were expected to be published in 2022 by the European Commission, however it is now expected to be published in 2023. The four environmental objectives are:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources;\n- \u00b7 Transition to a circular economy;\n- \u00b7 Pollution prevention and control; and\n- \u00b7 Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the share of Environmentally sustainable (Taxonomy-aligned), Taxonomy-eligible but not-aligned and Taxonomy noneligible economic activities in turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) are required to be disclosed.\n\nThe Climate Delegated Act prioritised specific sectors responsible for 94% of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the EU. A high proportion of CRH's activities do not fall into these prioritised sectors and are not included in the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nAn assessment was completed by reviewing the Climate Delegated Act which established the descriptions of activities which are Taxonomy-eligible ((EU) 2021/2139).\n\nCRH is reporting under the environmental objective of climate change mitigation as our activities primarily contribute to climate change mitigation. This avoids double counting in the allocation of the numerator to Turnover, CapEx, and OpEx KPIs across economic activities by only applying one environmental objective.\n\n## CRH's assessment of Taxonomy-eligible economic activities\n\nWhile the Climate Delegated Act ((EU) 2021/2139) does not cover a high proportion of our economic activities, we have identified the economic activity \"3.7 Manufacture of cement\" as a Taxonomy-eligible activity.\n\nFurther activities are in scope only for CapEx as outlined in the CapEx table. Double counting is avoided whereby all CapEx from the cement business is reported under Activity 3.7 Manufacture of cement.\n\nWe also assessed the Delegated Regulation ((EU) 2022/1214) to see if any activities were Taxonomy-eligible. Some cement plants utilise generators for back up power generation. This represents an immaterial portion of the Group's electricity consumption. It is already reported under Activity 3.7 Manufacture of cement.\n\n## CRH's assessment of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nWe reviewed the Technical Screening Criteria to determine which of these eligible activities met the conditions of being Taxonomy-aligned. As a result of this assessment, we have identified 4% of economic activity 3.7 Manufacture of cement as Taxonomy-aligned. The level of alignment is low as the Technical Screening Criteria set is based upon the 10 lowest emitting cement plants in the EU. All of CRH's cement plants are part of a roadmap to reduce absolute emissions by 30% by 2030 (from a 2021 base year) as part of the Group's ambition to be a net-zero business by 2050 (see further details on page 27). This does not meet the CapEx plan requirements under the Taxonomy.\n\nIn addition, we also identified some CapEx projects as being Taxonomy-aligned. Details of this are included in the CapEx table.\n\nAs part of this assessment we verified the share of the economic activity that qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation and confirmed they caused no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives.\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n270\n\nAn assessment was also undertaken that confirmed compliance with the minimum safeguards. The assessment took into account the four overarching topics of Human rights (includes labour and consumer rights), Corruption/ Bribery, Taxation and Fair competition.\n\n## Share of Taxonomy-aligned, Taxonomy-eligible, not aligned, and Taxonomy non-eligible economic activities\n\n|                                 | Turnover   | Turnover             | Capital  Expenditure   | Capital  Expenditure   | Operating  Expenditure   | Operating  Expenditure   |\n|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                 | $bn        | Proportion  of Total | $bn                    | Proportion  of Total   | $bn                      | Proportion  of Total     |\n| Cement 1                        | 0.2        | 1 %                  | 0.0                    | 1 %                    | 0.0                      | 1 %                      |\n| Other economic  activities 2    |            |                      | 0.0                    | 0 %                    |                          |                          |\n| Taxonomy-aligned 3              | 0.2        | 1 %                  | 0.0                    | 1 %                    | 0.0                      | 1 %                      |\n| Cement 1                        | 4.1        | 12%                  | 0.4                    | 10%                    | 0.3                      | 21%                      |\n| Other economic  activities 4    |            |                      | 0.1                    | 4 %                    |                          |                          |\n| Taxonomy-eligible,  not aligned | 4.1        | 12%                  | 0.5                    | 14%                    | 0.3                      | 21%                      |\n| Taxonomy non-eligible           | 28.4       | 87%                  | 3.1                    | 85%                    | 1.3                      | 78%                      |\n| Group Total                     | 32.7       | 100%                 | 3.6                    | 100%                   | 1.6                      | 100%                     |\n\nNote: numbers are rounded to the nearest $100m and percentages to the nearest %.

The proportion of Taxonomyeligible activities decreased in 2022 due to a greater share of CRH's product portfolio in lower-carbon businesses that are currently not included in the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nThe accounting policy applicable for revenue recognition is addressed in detail on page 184 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\nBusiness Performance & Segmental Reviews\n\nGovernance\n\nCRH's share of turnover associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities for the year ended 31 December 2022 is 1%. Taxonomy-aligned turnover is wholly comprised of turnover from the sale of grey cementitious materials to third-parties.\n\nIn addition to the Taxonomy-aligned turnover, CRH's Taxonomy-aligned businesses also sold cementitious materials to other Group companies for use in downstream activities. This represented 20% of total revenue for those businesses. This is a key driver of CRH's vertically integrated business model and helps contribute to the lower-carbon intensity of CRH's downstream businesses.\n\n## Capital Expenditure KPI\n\nThe share of Taxonomy-aligned CapEx is calculated by the proportion of CapEx associated with economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned (numerator) over total CapEx (denominator).\n\nTotal CapEx includes additions to tangible and intangible assets, considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, and excluding fair value changes. It also includes additions as a result of business combinations. Total CapEx involves all additions to Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E), Right-of-Use Assets and Intangible Assets. Any acquired goodwill is not considered.\n\nFor the reconciliation of total CapEx please see note 13, note 14 and note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCRH's share of CapEx associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities for the year ended 31 December 2022 is 1%. Taxonomy-aligned CapEx primarily comprises additions to owned PP&E. CapEx in the cement business in 2022 was 11% of Group CapEx (2021: 14%). The decrease is primarily due to the addition of intangible assets on the acquisition of Barrette whose business activities are currently not included in the current Climate Delegated Act.\n\nCRH continuously invests in technology and efficiency projects across our operating companies to enhance environmental performance, as well as investing in the environmental element of major capital investment projects to ensure we reach our CO 2 reduction targets. In 2022 CRH announced investing approximately $150 million of incremental annual CapEx to meet the Group's carbon emissions reduction targets. This CapEx does not meet the CapEx plan requirements under the Taxonomy.\n\n## Operating Expenditure KPI\n\nThe share of Taxonomy-aligned OpEx is calculated by the proportion of OpEx associated with economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned (numerator) over total OpEx (denominator) as defined by the EU Taxonomy regulation.\n\nEU Taxonomy regulations define total OpEx as the direct non-capitalised costs of R&D, building renovation measures, short-term leases, repairs and maintenance and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of PP&E.\n\nAs the EU Taxonomy regulation has its own definition of OpEx, the reported OpEx only represents a proportion of the total Group cost of sales and operating costs, and includes repairs and maintenance, short-term leases and R&D costs.\n\nCRH's share of OpEx associated with Taxonomy-aligned economic activities for the year ended 31 December 2022 was 1%. Taxonomy-aligned OpEx comprises repairs and maintenance costs and some short-term leases.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\nShareholder Information\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n271",

The sensitivity analysis measures the estimated impact on profit before tax and on total equity arising on net year -end floating rate debt and on year -end equity, based on either an increase/decrease of 1% in floating interest rates or a 5% strengthening/weakening in the US Dollar/euro exchange rate. The US Dollar/ euro rate has been selected for this sensitivity analysis given the materiality of the Group's activities in euro. This analysis, set out in note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, is for illustrative purposes only as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.\n\nQuantitative and qualitative information and sensitivity analysis of market risk is contained in notes 21 to 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nCRH does not have any off -balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on CRH's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.",

        "page_content": "## Other Disclosures\n\n## History, Development and Organisational Structure of the Company\n\nCRH resulted from the merger in 1970 of two leading Irish public companies, Cement Limited (established in 1936) and Roadstone Limited (incorporated in 1949). Cement Limited manufactured and supplied cement while Roadstone Limited was primarily involved in the manufacture and supply of aggregates, readymixed concrete, mortar, coated macadam, asphalt and contract surfacing to the Irish construction industry.\n\nAs a result of planned geographic diversification since the mid -1970s, the Group has expanded by acquisition and organic growth into a leading manufacturer and supplier of building materials, products and integrated solutions with operations in 29 countries around the world.\n\nThe Company is incorporated and domiciled in Ireland. CRH is a public limited company operating under the Companies Act 2014 of Ireland. The Group's worldwide headquarters is located in Dublin, Ireland. Our principal executive offices are located at Stonemason's Way, Rathfarnham, Dublin 16, Ireland (telephone: +353 1 404 1000). The Company's registered office is located at 42 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin 2, Ireland and our US agent is CRH America, Inc., 900 Ashwood Parkway, Suite 600, Atlanta, Georgia 30338.\n\nThe Company is the holding company of the Group, with direct and indirect share and loan interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.\n\nFrom Group headquarters, a small team of executives exercise strategic control over our decentralised operations.\n\nIn the detailed description of CRH's business on pages 60 to 79, estimates of the Group's various aggregates and stone reserves and resources have been provided by engineers employed by the individual operating companies. Further details are included on pages 262 to 267. Details of product end -use by sector for each reporting segment are based on management estimates.\n\nA listing of the principal subsidiary undertakings and equity accounted investments is contained on pages 290 to 293.\n\n## Statements Regarding Competitive Position and Construction Activity\n\nStatements made in the Business Performance section and elsewhere in this document referring to the Group's competitive position are based on the Group's belief, and in some cases rely on a range of sources, including investment analysts' reports, independent market studies and the Group's internal assessment of market share based on publicly available information about the financial results and performance of market participants.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, references to construction activity or other market activity relate to the relevant market as a whole and are based on publicly available information from a range of sources, including independent market studies, construction industry data and economic forecasts for individual jurisdictions.\n\n## Governmental Policies\n\nThe overall level of government capital expenditures and the allocation by state entities of available funds to different projects, as well as interest rate and tax policies, directly affect the overall levels of construction activity. The terms and general availability of government permits required to conduct Group business also has an impact on the scope of Group operations. As a result such governmental decisions and policies can have a significant impact on the operating results of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n275\n\n## Exchange Rates\n\nIn this Annual Report and Form 20 -F, references to 'US Dollar', 'US$', '$', 'US cents', 'cent' or 'c' are, unless otherwise stated, to the United States currency, references to 'euro', 'euro cent' or '\u20ac' are to the euro currency and 'Stg\u00a3' or 'Pound Sterling' are to the currency of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). Other currencies referred to in this Annual Report and Form 20 -F include Polish Zloty (PLN), Swiss Franc (CHF), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Chinese Renminbi (RMB), Indian Rupee (INR), Ukrainian Hryvnia (UAH), Philippine Peso (PHP), Romanian Leu (RON) and Serbian Dinar (RSD).\n\nFor a discussion on the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the financial condition and results of the operations of the Group, see the Business Performance section beginning on page 60.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nGroup companies are parties to various legal proceedings, including some in which claims for damages have been asserted against the companies. Having taken appropriate advice, we believe that the aggregate outcome of such proceedings will not have a material effect on the Group's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n\n## Possible Environmental Liabilities\n\nAt 17 February 2023, there were no pending legal proceedings relating to site remediation which are anticipated to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations or liquidity of the Group, nor have internal reviews revealed any situations of likely material environmental liability to the Group.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nCRH is engaged in ongoing initiatives that advance its business as part of its relentless focus on continuous improvement. One of these areas is research and development, where such costs are not material in the context of the Consolidated Income Statement. CRH's policy is to expense such costs as they occur.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe average number of employees for the past three financial years is disclosed in note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 199. The Group believes that relations with its employees and labour unions are satisfactory.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nActivity in the construction industry is characterised by cyclicality and is dependent to a considerable extent on the seasonal impact of weather in CRH's operating locations, with activity in some markets reduced significantly in winter due to inclement weather. First -half sales accounted for 46% of full -year 2022 (2021: 45%), while EBITDA (as defined)* for the first six months of 2022 represented 39% of the full -year out -turn (2021: 36%).\n\n## Significant Change\n\nNo significant changes have occurred since the balance sheet date.\n\n## Latest Practicable Information\n\nWhere referenced in the Supplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures and Shareholder Information sections, information is provided at the latest practicable date, 17 February 2023.\n\n* EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, asset impairment charges, profit on disposals and the Group's share of equity\n\naccounted investments' profit after tax.\n\nFinancial Statements",

As a result of Brexit, CREST was no longer available to any Irish incorporated issuers, irrespective of whether they are listed in Ireland, London or both, and all Irish issuers had to migrate from CREST to the market's chosen replacement system, Euroclear Bank Belgium. An Extraordinary General Meeting was held on 9 February 2021 to seek shareholder approval to the migration of the Company's securities to Euroclear Bank's central securities depository and to approve associated changes to the Articles of Association. All resolutions were passed and the migration took effect on 15 March 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Dividends\n\nThe Company has paid dividends on its Ordinary Shares in respect of each fiscal year since the formation of the Group in 1970. Dividends are paid to shareholders on the Register of Members on the record date for the dividend. Record dates are set in accordance with the rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin. An interim dividend is normally declared by the Board of Directors in August of each year and is generally paid in September/October. A final dividend is normally recommended by the Board of Directors following the end of the fiscal year to which it relates and, if approved by the shareholders at an AGM, is generally paid in April/May of that year.\n\nThe payment of future cash dividends will be dependent upon future earnings, the financial condition of the Group and other factors.\n\nThe below table sets forth the amounts of interim, final and total dividends declared in US Dollar (2020-2022) and euro (2018-2019) per Ordinary Share in respect of each fiscal year indicated. Solely for the convenience of the reader, dividends declared in the years 2018-2019 have been translated into US Dollar per Ordinary Share at the dividend record date exchange rate. An interim dividend of $0.24 was paid in respect of Ordinary Shares on 7 October 2022. The final dividend, if approved at the forthcoming AGM of shareholders to be held on 27 April 2023, will be paid on 4 May 2023 to shareholders on the Register of Members as at the close of business on 17 March 2023 and will bring the full-year dividend for 2022 to $1.27.\n\nDividend Withholding Tax (DWT) must be deducted from dividends paid by an Irish resident company, unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company's Registrars, Link Registrars Limited (the 'Registrars'). DWT applies to dividends paid by way of cash or by way of shares under a scrip dividend scheme and is deducted at the standard rate of Income Tax (25%). Non-resident shareholders located in countries with a double tax treaty with Ireland and certain Irish companies, trusts, pension schemes, investment undertakings and charities may be entitled to claim exemption from DWT. Copies of the exemption form may be obtained from the Registrars. Shareholders should note that DWT will be deducted from dividends in cases where a properly completed form has not been received by the specified deadline notified when a dividend is announced. Individuals who are resident in the Republic of Ireland for tax purposes are not entitled to an exemption. If shares are held via Euroclear Bank (EB) or CREST, the owners of the shares will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held in order to arrange for their dividends to be exempted.\n\nShareholders holding Ordinary Shares in certificated form who wish to have their dividend paid direct to their bank account, by electronic funds transfer, can do so by logging on to www.signalshares.com, selecting CRH plc and registering for\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n280\n\nthe share portal (the 'Share Portal'). Shareholders should note that they will need to have their Investor Code (found on documents issued by the Registrars), and follow the instructions online to register.\n\nAlternatively such shareholders can complete a paper dividend mandate form and submit it to the Registrars. A copy of the form can be obtained on the Registrars's Share Portal or can be requested directly from the Registrars. Tax vouchers will continue to be sent to the shareholder's registered address under this arrangement.\n\nIf shares are held via EB or CREST, the dividend will be paid by the Company in accordance with the instructions received from EB.\n\nSection 5 of the Euroclear Terms and Conditions governing use of the Euroclear system provides that income/dividends received by EB will be distributed prorata to the holders of the relevant securities (i.e. the relevant EB Participants).\n\nFurther details on the process of collection, distribution and payment of dividends are provided for in section 5.3 of the EB Operating Procedures, with reference to the Online Market Guides for market specific operational elements (currently the EB Service Description). All material information regarding the manner in which receipt of dividends and participation in corporate actions is processed is described in section 5 of the EB Services Description - (Version 4) - Custody Income and Corporate Actions. The owners of the shares held via EB or CREST will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held in order to arrange for the onward payment of the dividend to them.\n\nWhile dividends are declared in US Dollar, the default payment currency is euro. In order to avoid costs to shareholders, dividends are paid in Pound Sterling and US Dollar to shareholders whose shares are held in certificated form and whose address, according to the Share Register, is in the UK and the US respectively, unless they require otherwise. In respect of the 2022 final dividend, the latest date for receipt of currency elections is 31 March 2023. Where shares are held in the EB system, dividends are automatically paid in euro unless a currency election is made.\n\nInvestors holding CREST Depositary Interests (CDIs) should refer to the CREST International Service Description for information on currency elections in respect of CDIs.\n\nDividends in respect of 7% 'A' Cumulative Preference Shares are paid half-yearly on 5 April and 5 October. Dividends in respect of 5% Cumulative Preference Shares are paid half-yearly on 15 April and 15 October.\n\n|                         |                         |                         |                         | US Dollar per Ordinary Share      | US Dollar per Ordinary Share      | US Dollar per Ordinary Share      |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December  |                         |                         |                         | Interim                           | Final                             | Total                             |\n| 2022                    |                         |                         |                         | $0.24                             | $1.03(i)                          | $1.27                             |\n| 2021                    |                         |                         |                         | $0.23                             | $0.98                             | $1.21                             |\n| 2020                    |                         |                         |                         | $0.22                             | $0.93                             | $1.15                             |\n|                         | euro per Ordinary Share | euro per Ordinary Share | euro per Ordinary Share | US Dollar per Ordinary Share (ii) | US Dollar per Ordinary Share (ii) | US Dollar per Ordinary Share (ii) |\n| Years ended 31 December | Interim                 | Final                   | Total                   | Interim                           | Final                             | Total                             |\n| 2019                    | \u20ac0.20                   | \u20ac0.63                   | \u20ac0.83                   | $0.22                             | $0.70                             | $0.92                             |\n| 2018                    | \u20ac0.20                   | \u20ac0.52                   | \u20ac0.72                   | $0.23                             | $0.59                             | $0.82                             |",

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\nBusiness Performance & Segmental Reviews\n\nGovernance\n\n## Share Plans\n\nThe Group operates share option schemes, performance share plans, share participation schemes and savings-related share option schemes (the 'Schemes') for eligible employees in all regions where the regulations permit the operation of such schemes. A brief description of the Schemes is outlined below. Shares issued (whether by way of the allotment of new shares or the reissue of Treasury Shares) in connection with the Schemes rank pari passu in all respects with the existing shares in the Company.\n\n## 2010 Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of new share option schemes to replace the schemes which were approved in May 2000 (2000 share option schemes). Following the approval by shareholders of the 2014 Performance Share Plan (see below), no further awards will be granted under the 2010 Share Option Schemes. Consequently, the last award under the 2010 Share Option Schemes was made in 2013.\n\nThe 2010 Share Option Schemes were based on one tier of options with a single vesting test. The performance criteria for the 2010 Share Option Schemes was EPS-based. Vesting only occurred once an initial performance target had been reached and, thereafter, exercise was dependent on continued employment in the Group. In considering the level of vesting based on EPS performance, the Remuneration Committee also considered the overall results of the Group.\n\nSubject to the achievement of the EPS performance criteria, options may be exercised not later than ten years from the date of grant of the option, and not earlier than the expiration of three years from the date of grant. Benefits under the schemes are not pensionable.\n\n## 2014 Performance Share Plan\n\nThe 2014 Performance Share Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 7 May 2014. It replaces the 2010 Share Option Scheme. See page 119 of the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report for more details.\n\n## Restricted Share Plan\n\nIn 2013, the Board approved the adoption of the 2013 Restricted Share Plan. Under the rules of the 2013 Restricted Share Plan, certain senior executives (excluding executive Board Directors) can receive conditional awards of shares. As executive Directors are excluded from awards; and no shares are allotted or reissued to satisfy the awards, the listing rules of the LSE and Euronext Dublin do not require shareholder approval for the 2013 Restricted Share Plan.\n\n## 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 5 May 2010, shareholders approved the adoption of savings-related share option schemes for the UK and Ireland (the '2010 Savingsrelated Share Option Schemes') to replace the 2000 Savings-related Share Option Schemes. These schemes expired in May 2020.\n\nPrior to the expiry of these schemes, all employees of a participating subsidiary in the Republic of Ireland or the UK, who had satisfied a required qualifying period, were invited to participate in this scheme.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n281\n\nAt the commencement of each contract period employees were granted an option to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company at an option price which was equal to the amount proposed to be saved plus the bonus payable by the nominated savings institution at the end of the savings period. The price payable for each Ordinary Share under an option could not be less than the higher of par or 75% (or in the case of the UK scheme 80%) of the market value of a share on the day the invitation to apply for the option was issued.\n\nOn completion of the savings contract, employees may use the amount saved, together with the bonus earned, to exercise the option.\n\nAt 1 March 2023, 2,515,738 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes to date.\n\n## 2021 Savings-related Share Option Schemes\n\nAt the AGM held on 29 April 2021, shareholders approved the adoption of savings-related share options schemes for the UK and Ireland (the '2021 Savings-related Share Option Schemes') to replace the 2010 Savings-related Share Option Schemes.\n\nAll employees of a participating subsidiary in the Republic of Ireland or the UK, who have satisfied a required qualifying period, are invited to participate in this scheme, although at present there is currently no financial services provider supporting new awards under Irish SAYE schemes following the exit from the market of the current provider in 2021. Eligible employees who wish to participate in the scheme enter into a savings contract with a nominated savings institution, for a three or a five-year period, to save a maximum of \u20ac500 or Stg\u00a3500, as appropriate, per month.\n\nAt the commencement of each contract period employees are granted an option to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company at an option price which is equal to the amount proposed to be saved plus the bonus payable by the nominated savings institution at the end of the savings period. The price payable for each Ordinary Share under an option will not be less than the higher of par or 85% of the market value of a share on the day the invitation to apply for the option is issued.\n\nOn completion of the savings contract, employees may use the amount saved, together with the bonus earned, to exercise the option.\n\nAt 1 March 2023, 218 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the 2021 Savings-related Share Option Scheme to date.\n\n## Share Participation Schemes\n\nAt the AGM on 13 May 1987, shareholders approved the establishment of Share Participation Schemes for the Company, its subsidiaries and companies under its control. Directors and employees of the companies who are tax resident in Ireland and have at least one year's service may elect to participate in these Share Participation Schemes.\n\nAt 1 March 2023, 8,593,666 Ordinary Shares have been issued 1 pursuant to the Share Participation Schemes.\n\nEligible employees who wished to participate in the scheme entered into a savings contract with a nominated savings institution, for a three or a five-year period, to save a maximum of \u20ac500 or Stg\u00a3500, as appropriate, per month.\n\n1.

        "page_content": "Strategy Report\n\nBusiness Performance & Segmental Reviews\n\nGovernance\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe following summary outlines the material aspects of US federal income and Republic of Ireland tax law regarding the ownership and disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs. Because it is a summary, holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs are advised to consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of their ownership or disposition. The discussion regarding US federal income tax only applies to you if you hold your shares or ADSs as capital assets for US federal income tax purposes. This discussion addresses only US federal income and Republic of Ireland taxation and does not discuss all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your individual circumstances, including foreign, state or local tax consequences, estate and gift tax consequences, and tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. This summary does not take into account the specific circumstances of any particular holders (such as tax-exempt entities, certain insurance companies, brokerdealers, traders in securities that elect to mark-to-market, investors liable for alternative minimum tax, investors that actually or constructively own 10% or more of the stock of the Company (by vote or value), investors that hold Ordinary Shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, investors that hold Ordinary Shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes or investors whose functional currency is not the US Dollar), some of which may be subject to special rules. In addition, if a partnership holds the Ordinary Shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below. Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs are advised to consult their tax advisors with respect to US federal, state and local, Republic of Ireland and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of Ordinary Shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Income Tax Treaty (as defined below) in respect of their investment in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.\n\nThe statements regarding US and Irish laws set forth below are based, in part, on representations of the Depositary and assume that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with their terms.\n\nThis section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations, published rulings and court decisions, and the laws of the Republic of Ireland all as currently in effect, as well as the Convention between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital Gains (the 'Income Tax Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.\n\nIn general, holders of ADSs will be treated as the owners of Ordinary Shares represented thereby for the purposes of the Income Tax Treaty and for US federal income tax purposes. Exchanges of Ordinary Shares for ADSs, and ADSs for Ordinary Shares, generally will not be subject to US federal income or Irish tax.\n\nAs used herein, the term 'US holder' means a beneficial owner of an Ordinary Share or ADS who, for US federal income tax purposes: (i) is a US citizen or resident, a US corporation, an estate whose income is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust, and (ii) is not a resident of, or ordinarily resident in, the Republic of Ireland for purposes of Irish taxes.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends Paid to US Holders\n\nUnder general Irish tax law, US holders are not liable for Irish tax on dividends received from the Company. On the payment of dividends, the Company is obliged to withhold DWT. The statutory rate during 2022 was 25% of the dividend payable. Dividends paid by the Company to a US tax resident individual will be exempt from DWT provided the following conditions are met:\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n283\n\n- 1. the individual (who must be the beneficial owner) is resident for tax purposes in the US (or any country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty) and neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland; and\n- 2. the individual signs a declaration to the Company, which states that he/she is a US tax resident individual at the time of making the declaration and that he/she will notify the Company in writing when he/she no longer meets the condition in (1) above; or\n- 3. the individual provides the Company with a certificate of tax residency from the US tax authorities.\n\nDividends paid by the Company to a US tax resident company (which must be the beneficial owner) will be exempt from DWT, provided the following conditions are met:\n\n- 1. the recipient company is resident for tax purposes in the US (or any country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty) and not under the control, either directly or indirectly, of Irish resident persons;\n- 2. the recipient company is not tax resident in Ireland; and\n- 3. the recipient company provides a declaration to the Company, which states that it is entitled to an exemption from DWT, on the basis that it meets the condition in (1) above at the time of making the declaration, and that it will notify the Company when it no longer meets the condition in (1) above.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, and subject to the passive foreign investment company (PFIC) rules discussed overleaf, US holders will include in gross income the gross amount of any dividend paid by the Company out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes) as ordinary income when the dividend is actually or constructively received by the US holder, in the case of Ordinary Shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs. Any Irish tax withheld from this dividend payment must be included in this gross amount even though the amount withheld is not in fact received. Dividends paid to non-corporate US holders that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxed at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided certain holding period requirements are met. Dividends the Company pays with respect to Ordinary Shares or ADSs generally will be qualified dividend income.\n\nDividends paid by CRH will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution includable in income of a US holder will be the US Dollar value of the dividends on the date they are distributed, regardless of whether the US holder elects to receive the payment in a currency other than US Dollars. If the US holder elects to receive the payment in a currency other than US Dollars, generally any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the dividend payment is distributed to the date such payment is received will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. Such gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.",

        "page_content": "## Taxation continued\n\nDistributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, the Company does not calculate earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax principles. Accordingly, US holders should expect to generally treat distributions the Company makes as dividends.\n\nFor foreign tax credit limitation purposes, dividends the Company pays with respect to Ordinary Shares or ADSs will generally be income from sources outside the US, and will, depending on your circumstances, generally be 'passive' income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to a US holder.\n\nSubject to certain limitations, the Irish tax withheld in accordance with the Income Tax Treaty and paid over to the Republic of Ireland will be creditable or deductible against your US federal income tax liability. However, under recently finalised Treasury regulations, it is possible that the Irish tax may not be creditable unless you are eligible for and elect to apply the benefits of the Income Tax Treaty. Special rules apply in determining the foreign tax credit limitation with respect to dividends that are subject to the preferential tax rates. Any Irish tax withheld from distributions will not be eligible for a foreign tax credit to the extent an exemption from the tax withheld is available to the US holder.\n\n## Capital Gains Tax\n\nA US holder will not be liable for Irish tax on gains realised on the sale or other disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs unless the Ordinary Shares or ADSs are held in connection with a trade or business carried on by such holder in the Republic of Ireland through a branch or agency. A US holder will be liable for US federal income tax on such gains in the same manner as gains from a sale or other disposition of any other shares in a company.\n\nSubject to the PFIC rules below, US holders who sell or otherwise dispose of Ordinary Shares or ADSs will recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US Dollar value of the amount realised on the sale or disposition and the tax basis, determined in US Dollars, in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs.\n\nCapital gains of a non-corporate US holder are generally taxed at a preferential rate where the holder has a holding period greater than one year, and the capital gain or loss will generally be US source for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\n## Capital Acquisitions Tax (Estate/Gift Tax)\n\nAlthough non-residents may hold Ordinary Shares, the shares are deemed to be situated in the Republic of Ireland, because the Company is required to maintain its Share Register in the Republic of Ireland for Irish Capital Gains Tax purposes.\n\nAccordingly, holders of Ordinary Shares may be subject to Irish gift or inheritance tax, notwithstanding that the parties involved are domiciled and resident outside the Republic of Ireland. Certain exemption thresholds apply to gifts and inheritances depending on the relationship between the donor and donee.\n\nUnder the Ireland-US Estate Tax Treaty with respect to taxes on the estates of deceased persons, credit against US federal estate tax is available in respect of any Irish inheritance tax payable in respect of transfers of Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Additional US Federal Income Tax Considerations\n\nThe Company believes that Ordinary Shares and ADSs should not currently be treated as stock of a PFIC for US federal income tax purposes and does not expect them to become stock of a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. If the Company is treated as a PFIC and you are a US holder that did not make a mark-to-market election, you will be subject to special rules with respect to any gain you realise on the sale or other disposition of your Ordinary Shares or ADSs and any excess distribution that the Company makes to you. Generally, any such gain or excess distribution will be allocated ratably over your holding period for the Ordinary Shares or ADSs, the amount allocated to the taxable year in which you realised the gain or received the excess distribution, or to prior years before the first year in which we were a PFIC with respect to you, will be taxed as ordinary income, the amount allocated to each prior year will be generally taxed as ordinary income at the highest tax rate in effect for each other such year, and an interest charge will be applied to any tax attributable to such gain or excess distribution for the prior years. With certain\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n284\n\nexceptions, Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if the company was a PFIC at any time during the investor's holding period in the Ordinary Shares or ADSs. In addition, dividends that you receive from the Company will not constitute qualified dividend income to you if the Company is deemed to be a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.\n\n## Stamp Duty\n\nSection 90 Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 exempts from Irish stamp duty transfers of ADSs where the ADSs are dealt in and quoted on a recognised stock exchange in the US and the underlying deposited securities are dealt in and quoted on a recognised stock exchange. The Irish tax authorities regard NASDAQ and the NYSE as recognised stock exchanges. Irish stamp duty will be charged at the rate of 1% of the amount or value of the consideration on any conveyance or transfer on sale of Ordinary Shares (exemption generally available in the case of single transfers with a value of less than \u20ac1,000). Exchanges of Ordinary Shares for ADSs, and ADSs for Ordinary Shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty in certain circumstances.",

        "page_content": "## Memorandum and Articles of Association\n\nThe Company's Memorandum of Association sets out the objects and powers of the Company. The Articles of Association detail the rights attaching to each share class; the method by which the Company's shares can be purchased or reissued; the provisions which apply to the holding of and voting at general meetings; and the rules relating to the Directors, including their appointment, retirement, re-election, duties and powers.\n\nA copy of the current Memorandum and Articles of Association can be obtained from the Group's website, www.crh.com.\n\nThe following summarises certain provisions of CRH's Memorandum and Articles of Association and applicable Irish law.\n\n## Objects and Purposes\n\nCRH is incorporated under the name CRH public limited company and is registered in Ireland with registered number 12965. Clause 4 of CRH's Memorandum of Association provides that its objects include the business of an investment holding company. Clause 4 also sets out other objects including the business of quarry masters and proprietors and lessees and workers of quarries, sand and gravel pits, mines and the like generally; the business of road-makers and contractors, building contractors, builders merchants and providers and dealers in road making and building materials, timber merchants; and the carrying on of any other business calculated to benefit CRH. The memorandum grants CRH a range of corporate capabilities to effect these objects.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Directors manage the business and affairs of CRH.\n\nDirectors who are in any way, whether directly or indirectly, interested in contracts or other arrangements with CRH must declare the nature of their interest at a meeting of the Directors, and, subject to certain exemptions, may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement or other proposal whatsoever in which they have any material interest other than by virtue of their interest in shares or debentures in the Company. However, in the absence of some other material interest not indicated below, a Director is entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum for the purpose of any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 the giving of security or indemnity with respect to money lent or obligations taken by the Director at the request or for the benefit of the Company;\n- \u00b7 the giving of security or indemnity to a third party with respect to a debt or obligation of the Company which the Director has assumed responsibility for under a guarantee, indemnity or the giving of security;\n- \u00b7 any proposal in which the Director is interested concerning the underwriting of Company shares, debentures or other securities;\n- \u00b7 any other proposal concerning any other company in which the Director is interested, directly or indirectly (whether as an officer, shareholder or otherwise) provided that the Director is not the holder of 1% or more of the voting interest in the shares of such company; and\n- \u00b7 proposals concerning the modification of certain retirement benefits under which the Director may benefit and which have been approved or are subject to approval by the Irish Revenue Commissioners\n\nThe Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, except that such general power is restricted to the aggregate amount of principal borrowed less cash balances of the Company and its subsidiaries not exceeding an amount twice the aggregate of (i) the share capital of the Company; and (ii) the amount standing to the credit of retained income, foreign currency translation reserve and other reserves, capital grants, deferred taxation and non-controlling interest; less any repayable government grants; less (iii) the aggregate amount of Treasury Shares and own shares held by the Company.\n\nThe Company in general meeting from time to time determines the fees payable to the Directors. The Board may grant special remuneration to any of its number who being called upon, shall render any special or extra services to the Company or go or reside abroad in connection with the conduct of any of the affairs of the Company.\n\nThe qualification of a Director is the holding alone and not jointly with any other person of 1,000 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company.\n\n## Voting Rights\n\nThe Articles provide that, at shareholders' meetings, holders of Ordinary Shares, either in person or by proxy, are entitled to one vote on a show of hands and one vote per share on a poll. No member is entitled to vote at any general meeting unless all calls or other sums immediately payable in respect of shares in the Company have been paid.\n\n## Laws, Decrees or Other Regulations\n\nThere are no restrictions under the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company or under Irish law that limit the right of non-Irish residents or foreign owners freely to hold their Ordinary Shares or to vote their Ordinary Shares.\n\n## Liquidation Rights/Return of Capital\n\nIn the event of the Company being wound up, the liquidator may, with the sanction of a shareholders' special resolution, divide among the holders of the Ordinary Shares the whole or any part of the net assets of the Company (after the return of capital and payment of accrued dividends on the preference shares) in cash or in kind, and may set such values as he deems fair upon any property to be so divided and determine how such division will be carried out. The liquidator may, with a like sanction, vest such assets in trust as he thinks fit, but no shareholders will be compelled to accept any shares or other assets upon which there is any liability.\n\n## Variation of Rights\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2014, the rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three fourths in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.\n\n## Issue of Shares\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 and the Articles of Association, the issue of shares is at the discretion of the Directors.\n\n## Dividends\n\nShareholders may by ordinary resolution declare final dividends and the Directors may declare interim dividends but no final dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors and no dividend may be paid otherwise than out of income available for that purpose in accordance with the Companies Act 2014. There is provision to offer scrip dividends in lieu of cash. The preference shares rank for fixed rate dividends in priority to the Ordinary Shares for the time being of the Company. Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date of its declaration shall, if the Directors so decide, be forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company.\n\n## Meetings\n\nShareholder meetings may be convened by majority vote of the Directors or requisitioned by shareholders holding not less than 5% of the voting rights of the Company. A quorum for a general meeting of the Company is constituted by two or more shareholders present in person and entitled to vote. The passing of resolutions at a meeting of the Company, other than special resolutions, requires a simple majority. A special resolution, in respect of which not less than 21 clear days' notice in writing must be given, requires the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the votes cast.\n\n## Disclosure of Shareholders' Interests\n\nA shareholder may lose the right to vote by not complying with any statutory notice or notice pursuant to Article 14 of the Articles of Association given by the Company requiring an indication in writing of: (i) the capacity in which the shares are held or any interest therein; (ii) the persons who have an interest in the shares and the nature of their interest; or (iii) whether any of the voting rights carried by such shares are the subject of any agreement or arrangement under which another person is entitled to control the shareholder's exercise of these rights.\n\nSupplemental 20-F and Other Disclosures\n\n2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F\n\n285",

Alternatively, such shareholders can choose to elect to receive email notifications that the Annual Reports and other Shareholder communications are available electronically. However, shareholders holding shares in certificated form will continue to receive printed proxy forms, dividend documentation and, if the Company deems it appropriate, other documentation by post. Such shareholders can alter the method by which they receive communications by contacting the Registrars. If shares are held through the EB system or as CREST Depository Interests (CDIs), the owners of the shares will need to contact the intermediary through whom the shares are held if they wish to make arrangements regarding receipt of the Annual Report and Form 20-F and other shareholder communications.\n\n## CRH Website\n\nInformation on, or accessible through our website, www.crh.com, other than the item identified as the Annual Report and Form 20-F, does not form part of and is not incorporated into the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC (the 'Form 20-F'). References in this document to other documents on the CRH website, such as the CRH Sustainability Report, are included only as an aid to their location and are not incorporated by reference into the Form 20-F. The Group's website provides the full text of the Form 20-F, which is filed annually with the SEC, interim reports, trading updates, copies of presentations to analysts and investors and circulars to shareholders. News releases are made available in the News section of the website, immediately after release to the Stock Exchanges.\n\n## Electronic Proxy Voting\n\nShareholders holding shares in certificated form may lodge a proxy form for the 2023 AGM electronically by accessing the Registrars' website www.signalshares.com and entering CRH plc in the company name field. Shareholders will need to register for Signal Shares by clicking on \"registration section\" (if you have not registered previously) and following the registration instructions. Investors who hold their interests in the Company's shares through either the EB system or as CREST Depository Interests (CDIs) should refer to the EB Service Description or the CREST International Manual respectively or to the broker or custodian through whom they hold their shares to give their voting instructions. Further details on how shareholders who do not hold their shares in certificated form can vote electronically at the 2023 AGM are available in the notes to the Notice of the AGM.\n\n## Registrars\n\nEnquiries concerning shareholdings should be addressed to the Registrars: Link Registrars Limited, P.O.

Telephone: +353 1 553 0050 Email: enquiries@linkgroup.ie Website: www.linkgroup.eu Shareholders with access to the internet may check their accounts by logging onto www.signalshares.com, selecting CRH plc and registering for the share portal.

This facility allows shareholders to check their shareholdings and dividend payments, register e-mail addresses, appoint proxies electronically and download standard forms required to initiate changes in details held by the Registrars. Shareholders will need to register for a User ID before using some of the services.

The FAQs can be accessed in the Investors section of the website under Shareholder Centre.\n\n## Exchange Controls\n\nCertain aspects of CRH's international monetary operations outside the European Union were, prior to 31 December 1992, subject to regulation by the Central Bank of Ireland. These controls have now ceased. There are currently no Irish foreign exchange controls, or other statute or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital, that affect the remittance of dividends, other than dividend withholding tax on the Ordinary Shares, or that affect the conduct of the Company's operations.\n\n## Principal Accountant Fees and Services\n\nDetails of auditors' fees for Deloitte Ireland LLP, Dublin Ireland, PCAOB ID No. 1193 are set out in note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
