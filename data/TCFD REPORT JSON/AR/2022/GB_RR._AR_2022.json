We believe this is the most appropriate basis to measure our in-year performance as this reflects the substance of trading activity, including the impact of the Group's foreign exchange forward contracts, which lock in transactions at predetermined exchange rates. In addition, underlying results exclude the accounting impact of business acquisitions and disposals, certain impairment charges and exceptional items. A full definition of underlying and the reconciliation to the statutory figures can be found on pages 203 and 206. All references to organic change are at constant translational currency.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Any statements that express forecasts, expectations and projections are not guarantees of future performance and guidance may be updated from time to time. This report is intended to provide information to shareholders, and is not designed to be relied upon by any other party or for any other purpose, and the Company and its Directors accept no liability to any other person other than that required under English law. Latest information will be made available on the Group's website. By their nature, these statements involve risk and uncertainty and a number of factors could cause material differences to the actual results or developments.",

        "page_content": "## CHAIR'S STATEMENT\n\nRolls-Royce is a British industrial icon with world-leading technologies and exceptional people. We have significant opportunities to build on our foundations, realise our potential and create value that will benefit us all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPride is a word so often used in conjunction with Rolls-Royce - the pride our engineers take in the products they develop or the pride all our people take in working for this iconic company. Rolls-Royce is a British industrial icon with a long heritage of innovation, from the Merlin engine all the way through to today's Trent XWB, which has helped change the world. I share that sense of pride. It has deepened over the past year as I have had the opportunity to meet many more of our committed and dedicated employees.\n\nAs many of you know, as a third generation Rolls-Royce employee, I grew up surrounded by my father and grandfather's passion and enthusiasm for Rolls-Royce's innovation, creativity and world-class engineering. I also saw first hand the impact on the Company and all employees of living through a financial crisis. It is critical, therefore, that we build financial resilience and sustainable performance. We must remain in control of our own destiny and able to weather whatever the external environment throws at us.\n\nAny change journey starts with an acceptance of the current position and our new Chief Executive, Tufan Erginbilgic, who joined the Board in January 2023, has already delivered an honest assessment of our strengths and weaknesses. There are many positives - our strong market positions, the strength of our customer relationships, our exceptional technical competence, the commitment and passion of our people and the key role we play in the energy transition. Tufan, in his Chief Executive's review, talks passionately about why he joined Rolls-Royce, his commitment to the business and the challenges and opportunities that he sees. This shows the potential for significant performance improvements across our Group. This will benefit all our stakeholders. We will be a stronger long-term partner for our customers and suppliers. We will have the capacity to invest in innovation, engineering excellence and energy transition and we will be better able to reward our employees and investors.\n\n## Performance in 2022\n\nIn my first full year as Chair, we have made some progress towards a stronger financial future, as shown by our results for 2022. This was despite two significant macro events. Firstly, the bounce back from the pandemic led to inflationary and supply chain pressures, as lockdowns ceased and economic activity resumed in many parts of the world, albeit unevenly. Secondly, the Russia-Ukraine conflict exacerbated many of those inflationary pressures. Throughout the year, we continued to focus on operational execution, while actively managing inflation and supply chain challenges through tight cost control and robust long-term contracts with suppliers and customers, which enabled us to pass through much of the inflation risk. As a result, we were able to deliver on our financial expectations for the year (see page 18). Our expectations for 2023 (see page 19), however, are only the start of our new journey.\n\nDuring the year, we laid some positive foundations for the future, achieving a number of significant contract, customer and partnership wins across the Group. In Civil Aerospace, we signed new large engine orders from Malaysia Aviation Group, Norse Atlantic Airways and Qantas. We also secured our place on a new aircraft platform with the Trent XWB powering a new freighter from Airbus. After the end of the year, we announced our first ever widebody engine deal with an airline customer in India. The deal will make Air I ndia the largest operator of our Trent XWB-97 engines in the world. I n Defence, the Bell V-280 Valor was selected by the US Army for the future long range assault aircraft programme. Power Systems also secured a number of important defence wins, including an order for engines for the British army and a five-year service contract to support all of our engines that power Britain's naval fleet. Finally, Rolls-Royce Electrical entered into a partnership with Hyundai Motor Group to collaborate on all-electrical propulsion and hydrogen fuel cell technology.\n\n## Leadership transition\n\nIn many ways, 2022 marked the end of a chapter for Rolls-Royce. All three of the short-term commitments made by the business at the height of the pandemic have now been met. The first commitment was met in 2021 as we completed, ahead of schedule, the restructuring programme we undertook as a result of the impact of the pandemic. Our return to positive free cash flow in 2022 marked the delivery of our second short-term commitment. Finally, during the summer, we completed the sale of ITP Aero to a consortium of investors, which marked the completion of our third and final short-term commitment: to deliver proceeds of around \u00a32bn from a disposal programme.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious ending of a chapter, however, was that relating to Warren who stood down as Chief Executive at the end of 2022. During his seven years at the helm of Rolls-Royce and a total of eight on the Board, he navigated more major crises than many chief executives experience in a whole career. Several of those crises had their roots planted well before Warren took over and one, the pandemic, was of an unprecedented scale compared with anything else that has happened in global aviation since World War II. Warren showed incredible tenacity and integrity throughout. He was hugely admired by our employees, many of whom speak of the",

        "page_content": "hugely enjoyable personal interactions they had with him whenever he visited one of our sites. Personally, it was a great pleasure to work with him, albeit briefly, as Chair and I know many people learned a lot from his humility, empathy and, above all, his unquenchable curiosity. I and the rest of the Board would like to thank him for his passion, commitment and dedication to Rolls-Royce. We all wish him well for the future.\n\n## Board developments\n\nI inherited a Board in transition and while the task of ensuring the correct Board composition is never ultimately concluded, we have a significant level of diversity in terms of experience, skills, geography, leadership style, gender and ethnicity. Part of a Chair's role is also to ensure a culture of openness and transparency in which all views can be expressed and a 'collective brain' brought to bear on all issues. To ensure that brain is as high functioning as possible, requires diversity of thought. The breadth we now have encompasses everything from a wide range of business experience and sectoral expertise to cultural consideration and improved gender balance. We also have a firm grounding in engineering and technology and core competence in areas such as disciplined capital allocation which will stand us in good stead for the coming years.\n\nI  have already written about Tufan, who was appointed last summer following an in-depth global search conducted by external advisers (see page 72). Among other moves, Irene Dorner stepped down from the Board in May and Lord Jitesh Gadhia joined in April and became Chair of the Remuneration Committee following the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM). Lee Hsien Yang stepped down from the Board in December having reached his nine-year term. We recently announced the appointment of Birgit Behrendt with effect from the conclusion of the AGM on 11 May 2023. On joining the Board, Birgit will be appointed to the Nominations & Governance Committee and the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee. Birgit brings extensive global operational experience in large, complex international industrial groups having spent much of her executive career at Ford Motor Company, latterly as Vice President Global Purchasing. Her non-executive appointments have focused on industrial groups beyond the automotive industry, all with a focus on sustainability and transformation. Mike Manley has indicated his intention to step down from the Board of Rolls-Royce in order to focus on his US business interests and will not be standing for re-election at this year's AGM on 11 May. Mike has been a valued member of the Board and I would like to thank him for his dedication during his time with Rolls-Royce.\n\nWhile there is significant activity to come in the year ahead, much groundwork was laid down by the Board in 2022. I continued to meet with our major institutional investors in order to understand their expectations and concerns. These interactions have remained insightful and instructive and have provided valuable feedback for the whole Board.\n\n## Board involvement in climate governance\n\nThe Board also took tangible steps during the year to remain abreast of current best practice in terms of climate change reporting. During 2022, we received tailored training on climate-related matters (see page 34) and the Board reviewed the Group's climate-related governance. We were also actively involved in interactions with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and continued to closely review preparation for Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting.\n\n## Shareholder payments\n\nWe had a ten year track record of payments to shareholders prior to the pandemic but had to cease payments in 2020 to protect our balance sheet. We are still restricted by some of the conditions attached to our loan facilities from making payments to shareholders at this time. We are committed to returning to an investment grade credit rating through performance improvement and to resuming shareholder payments.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAs Tufan makes clear in his review (see page 6), we are now embarked upon the creation of a high-quality, sustainable, cash generative business with a strong balance sheet and growing returns, that can invest surplus capital in profitable growth. As our business strengthens we will create significant value for all stakeholders and be better able to play a key role in helping our customers benefit from the energy transition.\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank, on behalf of the whole Board, everyone in Rolls-Royce for their hard work and continued dedication.\n\n## Dame Anita Frew\n\nChair\n\nThe role of a board and its chair can, to some, appear somehow at arms' length to the operation of a business itself and somewhat distanced from the concerns of employees themselves. Amidst its supervisory, oversight and governance activities, which are well documented within this report (see page 59), the Board has, to my mind, a strong ambassadorial role. This is most obvious when dealing with our wide range of external stakeholders, with whom we continued to engage throughout the year (see page 50). During my first full year as Chair, I have endeavoured to further this mindset across the Board when interacting with our people. One of the opportunities we had during the year was our Meet the Board event immediately following the AGM, at which employees from across the Group were able to interact with Board members and share experiences, discuss concerns and swap insights. The level of interaction was terrific and such dialogue will be even more important going forward.",

        "page_content": "## CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW\n\nWe must harness the pride of our people to create a more successful company. We will reassert Rolls-Royce as a high-performing, growing and competitive business that has earned the right to invest in future growth. We are capable of moving faster, aiming higher and delivering stronger returns for all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is an honour to lead Rolls-Royce. There are only a handful of companies whose products have helped shape modern society. From the birth of transatlantic flight and Europe's first high speed rail service to the development of the jet engine itself, our ingenuity has helped bring the world closer together. Our brand is estimated to be one of the top five most reputable in the world and we have strong market share in attractive markets.\n\nDuring my introduction to the Company, I have spent time at our largest sites in the UK, Germany and US. Since joining, I have met many smart, hard-working and dedicated people and what struck me about all of them was the pride they feel in working for Rolls-Royce, in being part of a story that stretches back for generations. The people I have met are passionate about the products we make, excited about the possibility of their next invention and invested in our engineering capability. I am proud to be here too and I intend to harness the pride our people have and use it to create a stronger and much more successful company.\n\nMy career has been about partnering engineering expertise with  a  granular  strategy,  business  acumen  and  intense performance management. What I strive to create, and have achieved in my previous roles, is an organisation that thrives on what I term strategic progress. That means setting clear targets, managing performance with real focus and creating a mindset that is constantly looking to go further and improve the business everyday.\n\nThis needs to happen at Rolls-Royce because, as a business, we must do better. We can move faster, aim higher and deliver stronger returns for all our stakeholders. It is that potential of Rolls-Royce as a business, not its place as a household name, that was the primary motivator for me when I accepted the job as Chief Executive.\n\nThat potential needs to be realised in an external environment that is changing rapidly. Rising inflation, recessionary pressures, interest rate increases and supply chain issues are realities that we need to face head on. We need to respond proactively to the major trends around us including the energy transition, digitalisation and the growth of the middle classes in the developing world. We must ensure that we move at a greater pace than the world around us and not get left behind.\n\nIf the past few years have taught the business community anything, it is that uncertainty and change are the norm. We have seen the pandemic give way to geopolitical and macroeconomic shocks, causing an inflationary environment and destabilising supply chains. Further shocks cannot be ruled out and Rolls-Royce must be able to face them in a stronger position than it has held in the past. This requires a stronger balance sheet to build resilience and to underpin profitable growth opportunities.\n\nI am very confident that Rolls-Royce has the potential to do this but today we are underperforming and we have been for an extended period of time. Our total shareholder return over the last five years is negative. Cash generation is unsatisfactory. Our debt is too high. Too much of our gross profit is spent on overheads, interest payments and other costs. We must quickly and significantly improve our cash generation to strengthen our balance sheet. We need to get back to an investment grade credit rating through organic self-help, building on the \u00a32bn raised from the disposal programme.\n\nIf the past few years have taught the business community anything, it is that uncertainty and change are the norm. Rolls-Royce must be able to face the future in a stronger position than it has held in the past.\n\nProfit  and  margins  must  improve  to  create  a  quality  busi ness  with  satisfactory  returns  on  capital  employed.  Our underperformance is most evident in  Civil  Aerospace  but improvement is something that all our businesses need to deliver. In the past, Rolls-Royce has relied too much on market recovery to drive its success and our low operating margins and high cost base mean that we are not resilient enough to external factors when the environment is unfavourable.\n\nWe owe it to our stakeholders to perform better. It will require turning passion for engineering projects into a passion for profitable growth. We will set clear goals, performance manage with",

That last element unlocks belief within an organisation which creates the energy required to deliver extraordinary outcomes.\n\nWe need to apply a clear financial framework to, firstly, strengthen our balance sheet; secondly, reward investors with growing returns; and, thirdly, invest our surplus capital to drive future growth. Improving our cash generation will enable us to pay down debt and deleverage the balance sheet, in order to position ourselves to return to an investment grade credit rating as soon as possible. This will make us stronger and give us flexibility to allocate capital to drive growth in the future.\n\nWe have to make the right capital allocation choices to grow the  business  in  the  most  value  accretive  way.  We  cannot continue to allocate capital to projects that have low returns. This will mean capital allocation decisions in line with strategy and centrally allocated capital to markets and programmes in line with the framework.\n\nStrategically, we remain committed to helping our customers embrace net zero and we remain steadfast in our opinion that Rolls-Royce has an important role to play in the energy transition. The pace and level of our investment, however, will vary across the business depending on the market opportunity, fit with strategy and our capability.\n\nWe must reward the patience and support of our investors. I firmly believe that generating greater returns for shareholders and investing in future growth are not binary options. Good\n\nOnly projects which demonstrate satisfactory scores against these criteria will be considered for investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusinesses do both. For Rolls-Royce to do both, we will need to change. Before addressing how we will change, we will first look at where we stand today.\n\n## Improved profit and cash in 2022\n\nOur financial figures showed an increase on 2021 for revenue, profit and cash. Underlying revenue increased by 14%. Underlying operating profit was \u00a3652m, \u00a3238m higher than the prior year, with the increase driven by Civil Aerospace and Power Systems. Free cash flow from continuing operations of \u00a3505m was \u00a32.0bn higher than the prior year, led by engine flying hour recovery. Net debt of \u00a33.3bn was down from \u00a35.2bn at end 2021, due to disposals and improved cash flow.\n\nIncreased profits in Civil Aerospace and Power Systems were partly offset by lower profit in Defence and increased investment in New Markets. Margin growth reflected improvements in long term service agreement (LTSA) contract margins and increased spare engines profit in Civil Aerospace. This was partly offset by the non-repeat of a foreign exchange revaluation credit in Civil Aerospace and legacy spare parts sales in Defence in 2021, and lower margins in Power Systems due to cost increases.\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations improved from an outflow of \u00a31.5bn in 2021 to an inflow of \u00a30.5bn, driven by 35% growth in large engine flying hours, comparatively lower growth in large engine major shop visits at 19%, and higher Defence cash flow. Higher inventory in Power Systems saw its cash conversion ratio fall.\n\nIn 2023, a continued recovery in our end markets and the actions we are taking give us confidence in delivering higher profit and cash flow.",

We cannot rely upon external factors alone to deliver better results. We have already carried out extensive work benchmarking our Group performance and that of our businesses against our peers. That work shows there is significant scope for us to deliver materially higher profit, cash flows and returns in the medium-term. We have now launched a number of multi-year priorities and we are committed to operating a 'one Rolls-Royce' model, aligning the whole organisation behind them.\n\nOur priorities are clear. They are:\n\n- -focus on the safety of our people and products;\n- -significantly improve earnings and the cash potential of the business;\n- -deliver substantial efficiency improvements;\n- -improve cash generation and deleverage the balance sheet;\n- -develop a clear and granular strategy;\n- -play a key role in the energy transition; and\n- -engage our people and build capability.\n\nIt is imperative that the safety of our people and products remains our top priority throughout this process. In my previous roles, I have been able to achieve financial resilience and stronger returns while delivering record-setting safety performance. Safety is absolutely paramount to me and I fully understand how crucial both product and personal safety is within Rolls-Royce, which operates in some of the world's most regulated safety-critical industries. We will not tolerate any degradation of standards in the pursuit of efficiencies and, in fact, we will look to improve both.\n\nTo realise these priorities and the potential embedded within our business, we have launched the boldest change programme Rolls-Royce has carried out in many years. Internally, we refer to it as 'winning together' a name which signifies that this is about being the best we possibly can be and that it involves everyone within the organisation. It is not an activity which is the responsibility of one individual project team, it is the responsibility of everyone in Rolls-Royce. Our transformation programme will ensure that everyone moves at pace and is held accountable for their deliverables.\n\nThe transformation consists of seven workstreams and each of them is led by a senior leader. We are already delivering changes as we work at pace. Activity on many of the workstreams is already underway and as the year progresses we will look to embed the performance management and culture we need to ensure long-term sustainable success across the Group.\n\n## Efficiency and simplification\n\nWe are examining the organisational structure of the Group including synergies that we can harness from our one Rolls-Royce approach. We see opportunities for footprint consolidation as well as direct and indirect third party efficiencies. While costs were removed during the pandemic, particularly in Civil Aerospace, this was predominantly linked with the dramatic reduction in flying activity. We believe there remains significant opportunity to right-size our cost base to deliver sustainable cost efficiencies across the whole Group.\n\n## Commercial optimisation\n\nWe are bringing a sharper commercial edge to everything that we do to deliver increased profitability of contracts to improve our earnings, cash generation and returns. This means being rewarded by our customers for the value our products bring and the risks we take. A stronger Rolls-Royce will be a much better partner, better able to deliver operationally and invest in new products. I have met with a number of our largest customers already who understand this.",

Each business has a resourced programme aligned to our winning together change programme. We have set stretching performance targets following peer benchmarking analysis and we have already identified performance gaps we must address. Each business will be able take advantage of the other workstreams in this winning together programme to continually improve and reinforce their plans.\n\n## Working capital\n\nThis workstream is tasked with delivering a significant and structural reduction in working capital across the Group. By deep diving into the operational value chain and addressing working capital in its component parts, we believe that there are sustainable improvements available.\n\n## Strategic review\n\nOur strategic review process has now been launched. This Group-wide review will decide which areas we are going to invest in and which ones we will not. This investment prioritisation activity will ensure that we focus on profitable opportunities, in new technologies where we are differentiated, where the market size is sufficiently large and where there is a good fit and synergy with our existing activities.\n\nThis exercise is not about searching for easy wins but about taking tough decisions to create enduring value for all our stakeholders. The result of this review will be mid-term targets and a strategic implementation plan that we will share in the second half of 2023.\n\n## Performance management\n\nIn  order  to  succeed  in  all  these  areas,  our  performance management workstream is vital as it will enable us to ensure we are both proceeding with urgency and on track to achieve our goals. This work is already underway and will formalise as the year progresses. We will manage our businesses in a tight and timely manner and deliver on our expectations of high performance from everyone in support of our priorities and strategy.\n\n## Purpose and culture\n\nLater in the year we will complement our transformation with our final remaining workstream, purpose and culture. This will embed our purpose and winning culture throughout Rolls-Royce.\n\nAlongside being clear in setting out the 'what' of our change programme, what needs to be done differently and to what ends, we are also being very clear on the 'how', how we go about doing this. Alongside the greater strategic clarity, we have set clear expectations of leadership. While this mindset starts at the top, it is permeating throughout the business. We are going to hold ourselves accountable for delivery and performance and we are all team players, working as one company. On a practical level, this means taking a Group approach to making investment choices. On a more emotional level, it means we are all in this together. We are all passionate and committed to the extraordinary success of Rolls-Royce and, ultimately, here to make a real difference.\n\nWe are all team players working as one company. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us but we have begun at pace and the potential rewards for all our stakeholders are great.\n\nI believe we have the potential to be a much higher quality and more competitive company. The ultimate purpose of this activity is to create a Rolls-Royce of which all stakeholders can be proud. We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we have begun at pace and the potential rewards for all our stakeholders are great.\n\nThrough the actions we are now taking, we will reassert Rolls-Royce as a high-performing and competitive business with strong returns, profitability and cash flow. That will earn us the right to invest in future growth.\n\nRolls-Royce has created tremendous engineering solutions in the past which have engendered pride among our people. Now that same pride will be generated by realising the full potential of Rolls-Royce. I couldn't be more excited to be part of this team.\n\n## Tufan Erginbilgic\n\nChief Executive\n\nWe are already in action across all of these workstreams.

        "page_content": "## Strategic review\n\n## Maximise value from existing capabilities\n\nWe have launched a Group-wide strategic review that will help us to i dentify and assess strategic options, prioritise growth opportunities and assess current portfolio attractiveness. The result of this review will be a granular strategic plan with clearly defined milestones and key performance indicators to enable us to measure the progress.\n\n## Near-term areas of focus\n\nIn 2022, we dealt with external pressures, particularly in our supply chain and the inflationary issues caused by the recovery from the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and economic uncertainty. We are taking the necessary actions to protect our business from the risks of inflation, supply chain disruption and a tightening labour environment. We see the benefits of productivity and efficiency improvements and expect to see more progress to come, alongside being ever more disciplined on our commercial terms. In 2022, demand for our products and services continued to improve significantly, with a record year for order intake in Power Systems, accompanied by continued recovery in Civil Aerospace engine flying hours and a strong order book in Defence. We continue to capitalise on the opportunities presented by our long-term customer relationships and installed product base; to grow our capabilities in core markets and create new business opportunities.\n\n## Delivering on our commitments\n\nWe are delivering on our commitment to rebuild our balance sheet in the medium term. We have completed four disposals since 2020 with the sale of ITP Aero in September 2022. We repaid a \u00a32bn debt facility in September 2022, significantly reducing our net debt position while maintaining strong liquidity. In the second part of  the  year,  Fitch,  Moody's  and  S&P  Global  upgraded  our credit rating outlook which is a stepping stone to achieving our mid-term ambition of returning to an investment grade credit rating. In 2022, we grew our revenue and made significant progress on profitability which allowed us to deliver against our commitment to return to positive cash flow. We are also seeing the benefits from operational improvements. We will work on increasing the momentum by protecting the efficiencies that have been achieved and focus on supply chain and pricing strategy optimisation, cost control and working capital discipline alongside being more disciplined on our commercial terms.\n\nWe are also delivering against our commitment to simplify the way we communicate our business performance. In May 2022, we held an investor day to help investors with their understanding of the key drivers of our financial and operational performance and provided more details about the cost reduction programme and expected near-term improvements. We have introduced a new approach to foreign exchange hedging where we will carry a smaller hedge book, with a declining percentage of cover over a five-year period, which will mean that market movements in foreign exchange will impact us sooner. This change is more cost effective, brings us in line with our peers and allows us to anticipate and react to risks more quickly.\n\nWe are the beneficiaries of years, in some cases decades, of hard work, investing in the development of new products and growing market share. Across all our businesses, the key driver of revenue is the number of installed products in the market. This provides resilience against original equipment sales volatility and allows us to increase the scope of our aftermarket reach continuously and to maximise value through the lifecycle of the product.\n\nThis is especially true for Civil Aerospace. We are moving beyond a period of unprecedented investment in new Civil Aerospace engine programmes, with four new large engines and three new business jet engines launched in the last decade, to a period in which we will realise the benefits of that effort and investment. Increasing the size of our installed fleet in Civil Aerospace will drive aftermarket revenues which will create value in the medium term and beyond as older engines in our fleet will be retired and replaced with newer models. We remain focused on our services strategy to deliver high quality services to our customers while increasing the returns from the installed products by optimising our processes and operational footprint, reducing costs of maintenance and improving time on wing. There are two key areas we are working on: firstly, the fuel efficiency improvement of existing and newly developed products; and secondly, enabling our customers to use the products in a way that is compatible with sustainable fuels. We can pull the technology levers in our control through testing our existing products with new l ower carbon and sustainable fuels and creating upgrade kits, where necessary, to assist adoption.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nOver many years, Rolls-Royce has built expertise that led to the development of a wide range of technologies and products across various industries and markets. We are continuously exploring opportunities to develop new solutions for existing markets, applying current technologies to new markets, as well as entering new markets with new products.\n\nInnovation is difficult in those sectors where emissions need to reduce but it plays a critical role in developing our Civil Aerospace and Defence businesses. For instance, where our customers around the world are exploring ways to reduce the carbon footprint, there is demand for newer, more efficient products that are compatible with sustainable fuels. In Power Systems we are working on developing new sustainable technologies that allow us to tap into new addressable markets and stay competitive in existing markets while helping our customers in their net zero transition. Our New Markets business, comprising Rolls-Royce SMR and Rolls-Royce Electrical, draws on our existing technological and engineering expertise and experience in delivering complex solutions while working across a wide range of partners.",

        "page_content": "## EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Conflict in Europe\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has brought large-scale armed conflict to Europe, leading to a humanitarian crisis through the lives and livelihoods lost and disrupted. It has triggered mass displacement of people, political realignment and international sanctions as well as sharp escalations in food and energy costs. Cuts to supplies of gas to Europe are amplifying stresses in commodity markets and bring into focus the importance of secure access to energy; with policy shifting towards more diversified, increasingly domestic energy supply. The conflict has resulted in changes to the political landscape, including a re-appraisal of national security and defence priorities in countries most impacted by the conflict.\n\n## Economic uncertainty\n\nGlobal economic activity in 2022 was impacted by a broad and deep series of issues resulting in lower-than-expected growth and levels of inflation higher than seen in several decades. The post-COVID-19 global economy continues to face powerful challenges. Initial problems resulting from high levels of government debt and post-pandemic supply chain disruption have been compounded by conflict in Europe, fuelling a cost-ofliving crisis, as well as by a slowdown in China driven in part by continued intermittent lockdowns. Sustained uncertainty over energy supplies has contributed to reduced economic activity, particularly in manufacturing, dampening consumer and, to an extent, business confidence. Inflationary pressures have triggered a rapid and synchronised tightening of monetary conditions driving interest rate rises and a powerful strengthening of the US dollar against most other currencies. Labour markets remain tight with historically low unemployment rates and high levels of vacancies. Household debt levels are rising and discretionary spend falling.\n\n## Long-term trends\n\nDespite the turbulence in 2022, underlying longer-term opportunities and challenges presented by demographics, global economic development and environmental pressures remain. According to the UN, the global population reached eight billion in 2022 and is set to increase to almost ten billion by 2050, with more than 70% of people living in urban environments. Population and economic growth will lead to increased demand for power in markets served by Power Systems. Defence budgets, mainly driven by threat perception and economic growth, are forecast to grow with at least low single digits in real terms each year. One key determinant for demand in our Civil Aerospace business is the number of people in middle and higher-income levels able to afford air travel. Significant growth is expected globally but particularly in countries like China and India. With commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions being increasingly formalised, while being a tremendous societal challenge, this will provide business opportunities to bring cutting-edge technologies to market.\n\nFollowing the imposition of sanctions on Russia affecting areas of Rolls-Royce business, and an internal review of our willingness to do business in Russia, we took the decision in March 2022 to stop doing business in Russia. All of our activities affected by sanctions, which were first introduced in February 2022, were stopped immediately. We are reducing our reliance on Russia for titanium through securing a long-term agreement with an alternative supplier. As countries re-evaluate their defence capabilities, we are responding to customers and we are increasing production capacity in our Power Systems business to meet increased demand for military power and propulsion equipment. The need for domestic energy security sovereignty creates an opportunity for Rolls-Royce SMR.\n\n## Our response\n\nDiversity in our portfolio helps us to be resilient to short-term shocks. Throughout the pandemic, our Defence and Power Systems businesses helped offset some of the impact in Civil Aerospace. We have taken a number of actions to protect our business from the risks of inflation, supply chain disruption and a tightening labour environment through a sharper focus on pricing, productivity and costs. Many of our long-term contracts, as are common in the aerospace sector, contain inflation-linked pricing clauses based on standard indices for energy, materials and wages to mitigate cost increases. In Power Systems, a shorter cycle business, we have been able to raise prices in an environment where demand is strong and margins are closely leveraged to volumes. In Defence, we are working hard to manage supply chain costs through longterm purchasing agreements. Across the business we are taking steps to right size, reduce our cost base and focus investments; and will continue to manage the current energy and raw material inflation risks through supplier agreements and hedging policies.\n\n## Our response\n\nIn Civil Aerospace, we are now positioned to realise the benefits of having built market position over the last few decades. At the same time, we are developing technologies for next-generation aero-engines, certifying our products to be compatible with low and net zero carbon fuels and beginning research into the longer term potential of hydrogen. We have structured our Power Systems business to address particular growth areas in power generation, commercial marine and industrial segments. Through our joint ventures in China and India we are well-positioned to serve these rapidly growing markets. Our Defence business is well positioned in new markets that could enable growth beyond the existing core. Through Rolls-Royce SMR, we seek to bring to scale an affordable, low-carbon source of power and through Rolls-Royce Electrical we will pioneer electrical power and propulsion in the emerging advanced air mobility market. We are working to enable all our products, on air, sea and land, to be used sustainably.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\nWe delivered on our remaining short-term commitments in 2022. We continue to focus on improving our performance to strengthen our balance sheet and put us on a path to generate long-term sustainable value for stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, our underlying revenue was \u00a312.7bn, underlying operating profit increased to \u00a3652m and we returned to a positive cash flow \u00a3505m. We completed our programme of disposals, achieving around \u00a32bn  in  total  proceeds,  which  we  used  to  repay  debt. Strengthening our balance sheet is a priority and we remain committed to achieving an investment grade rating in the medium term through performance improvements. Although our 2022 results were improved year-on-year, we must do more. We will be bolder with our ambitions in 2023 and beyond as we deliver sustainable value to our stakeholders.\n\nDemand for our products and services continued to meaningfully improve, with a record year for order intake in Power Systems, accompanied by continued recovery in Civil Aerospace flying hours and progress in Defence, underpinned by key contract wins.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOur financial performance improved in 2022, largely driven by the recovery of our end markets following the pandemic. Large engine flying hours were up 35% compared with 2021. We generated free cash flows of \u00a3505m, a \u00a32.0bn improvement on the prior year, reflecting higher large engine flying hour receipts, which grew ahead of shop visit events. On an organic basis, underlying revenue i mproved by 14% and underlying operating profit improved by 48%, helped by the mix of OE engine sales in Civil Aerospace. In 2022, there was a higher volume and different mix of large spare engine sales, with more third party sales to capacity providers than in the prior year. Spare engines carry a higher margin than installed engine sales and accounted for a greater proportion of total engine sales than the 10% to 15% we typically expect in a year. Spare engine sales will be higher than the typical range next year also, as we grow the pool of spare engines to underpin fleet health and improve resilience. Contractual improvements in 2022 also increased the expected\n\nreturns on our long-term contracts. These contract improvements trigger the recognition of additional revenue and profits. These catch-ups are a normal part of our business and are a good indicator of progressive and sustainable performance improvement.\n\nIn 2022, we faced challenges from supply chain disruption and inflation. We are actively managing these headwinds through a sharper focus on pricing, productivity and costs and we will continue to address these areas as we strive to succeed in a challenging external environment. Examples of our actions to tackle these issues include our partnership approach with key suppliers, ensuring that we have contractual pricing protection in place through long-term contracts and the hedging of key raw materials and energy. We are tackling rising costs and supply chain constraints by repairing and reusing spare parts where we can. We will continue to improve our productivity and efficiency as we remain focused on these areas, as well as being more disciplined on our commercial terms.\n\n## Strengthening our balance sheet\n\nStrengthening our balance sheet remains a high priority. Our net debt was reduced to \u00a33.3bn from \u00a35.2bn. Since 2020, we have completed four disposals, including the sale of ITP Aero in September 2022 with proceeds of \u20ac1.6bn and a dividend of \u20ac0.1bn paid shortly prior to completion. The proceeds of this disposal were used to repay a \u00a32bn loan, which was supported by an 80% guarantee from UK Export Finance. As a result, we ended the year with \u00a34.1bn of drawn debt, all of which is on fixed interest rates and \u00a33.3bn net debt, including \u00a32.6bn of cash and \u00a31.8bn of lease liabilities. Our credit ratings are currently below investment grade, which is unacceptable and we must address this. We have seen positive momentum with outlook upgrades from Fitch, Moody's and S&P Global in 2022. Our liquidity position remains strong with \u00a38.1bn of liquidity and no significant debt maturities before 2024.\n\n## Simplification of reporting\n\nWe are committed to simplifying our reporting and the way we communicate our business performance. In 2022, we held an investor day at our Civil Aerospace site in Derby, UK, which was also streamed online. This event brought to life the changes we have started to make in our business to reduce cost and improve performance. This additional information, illustrated by a number of examples, helped investors to better understand the way our business works and how we are focusing on the improvements required to deliver better financial performance.\n\nOther examples of how we are driving simplicity include our new approach to foreign exchange hedging. Historically, we have hedged a declining percentage of our net foreign exchange exposure across a rolling ten-year horizon, based on our projected net US dollar revenues. Under our new approach, we will carry a smaller hedge book, with a declining percentage of cover over a five-year period, which will mean that market movements in foreign exchange will impact us sooner. This change is more cost effective, brings us in line with our peers and allows us to react quicker to changes in the external environment. We also refreshed our results press release to make it clearer and more concise.",

        "page_content": "## Investing wisely\n\nCapital allocation is critical to generating the right returns from our business. Our first priority is to reduce our debt, accelerating progress to an investment grade credit rating. We also recognise the importance of shareholder returns, both from investing in high return opportunities and from shareholder payments, which we aim to resume once our balance sheet is stronger.\n\nWe have strict criteria that we follow when considering investments. Firstly, any investment must be aligned to our strategy, taking us in the right direction to achieve our goals and vision. Linked to this are our strict criteria on sustainability and carbon impact, where investment opportunities must demonstrate alignment with our decarbonisation ambitions. Secondly, it needs to have a risk and reward profile that generates value. Our investments aim to generate a combination of near, medium and long-term returns. We are looking to strike a balance of protecting and growing our established businesses and pursuing long-term growth opportunities.\n\nAs we focus on strengthening our balance sheet we will be vigilant with our capital allocation decisions. In 2022, we spent \u00a31.3bn on research and development, \u00a3359m of which was paid for by funding from third parties. Investments made in 2022 included engineering to increase time on wing for our in-service engines, leading to better aftermarket margins as well as longer-dated investments in\n\nnew products. Not all of our capital allocation decisions are based purely on commercial returns. The health of our people and the safety of our processes and products remain the top priority, where investment will be made to ensure our people can be at their best in a safe environment. In 2022, we approved an investment to replace one of our ageing Defence test beds with a state-of-the-art facility, ensuring on-going health and safety standards are met.\n\n## Outlook\n\nA continued recovery in our end markets and the actions we are taking give us confidence in delivering higher profit and cash flows in 2023. This is based on large engine flying hours at 80% to 90% of the 2019 level and 1,200 to 1,300 total shop visits. We expect underlying operating profit between \u00a30.8bn and \u00a31.0bn, including \u00a3100m to \u00a3200m of targeted contract improvements (2022: \u00a3319m). We expect free cash flow of between \u00a30.6bn to \u00a30.8bn, which is based on \u00a3500m to \u00a3700m growth in the Civil LTSA creditor (2022: \u00a3792m), a year-on-year headwind of approximately \u00a3200m associated with legacy Boeing OE concessions and around \u00a3100m adverse impact in 2023 due to fires at two suppliers' premises in late 2022 and early 2023. This cash impact will reverse in 2024.\n\n## Panos Kakoullis\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n## Statutory and underlying Group financial performance from continuing operations\n\n|                                                       | 2022      | 2022                     | 2022                               | 2022                              | 2022       | 2021       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| \u00a3 million                                             | Statutory | Impact of  hedge book  1 | Impact of  acquisition  accounting | Impact of  non- underlying  items | Underlying | Underlying |\n| Revenue                                               | 13,520    | (829)                    | -                                  | -                                 | 12,691     | 10,947     |\n| Gross profit                                          | 2,757     | (264)                    | 58                                 | (74)                              | 2,477      | 1,996      |\n| Operating profit                                      | 837       | (264)                    | 58                                 | 21                                | 652        | 414        |\n| Gain arising on disposal of businesses                | 81        | -                        | -                                  | (81)                              | -          | -          |\n| Profit before financing and taxation                  | 918       | (264)                    | 58                                 | (60)                              | 652        | 414        |\n| Net financing costs                                   | (2,420)   | 1,935                    | -                                  | 39                                | (446)      | (378)      |\n| (Loss)/profit before taxation                         | (1,502)   | 1,671                    | 58                                 | (21)                              | 206        | 36         |\n| Taxation                                              | 308       | (416)                    | (9)                                | 69                                | (48)       | (26)       |\n| (Loss)/profit for the year from continuing operations | (1,194)   | 1,255                    | 49                                 | 48                                | 158        | 10         |\n| Basic (loss)/earnings per share (pence)               | (14.24)   |                          |                                    |                                   | 1.95       | 0.11       |\n\n- -Revenue: Underlying revenue of \u00a312.7bn was up 14%, largely driven by underlying revenue increases across Civil Aerospace, Defence and Power Systems. Statutory revenue of \u00a313.5bn was 21% higher compared with 2021. The difference between statutory and underlying revenue is driven by statutory revenue being measured at average prevailing exchange rates (2022: GBP:USD1.24; 2021: GBP:USD1.38) and underlying revenue being measured at the hedge book achieved rate during the year (2022 GBP:USD1.50; H1 2021: GBP:USD1.39; H2 2021: GBP:USD1.59).\n- -Operating profit: Underlying operating profit of \u00a3652m (5.1% margin) versus \u00a3414m (3.8% margin) in the prior year. The year-onyear growth was led by Civil Aerospace and Power Systems, partly offset by marginally lower year-on-year profits in Defence and increased investment in New Markets. Statutory operating profit was \u00a3837m, higher than the \u00a3652m underlying operating profit largely due to the \u00a3264m negative impact from currency hedges i n the underlying results. Net charges of \u00a321m were excluded from\n\nthe underlying results as these related to non-underlying items comprising: net restructuring charges of \u00a347m; net impairments of \u00a365m, partly offset by the write back of exceptional Trent 1000 programme credits of \u00a369m; and a \u00a322m pension past service credit.\n\n- -Profit before taxation: Underlying profit before tax of \u00a3206m included \u00a3(446)m net financing costs primarily related to net interest payable. Statutory loss before tax of \u00a3(1,502)m included \u00a3(1,579)m net fair value losses on derivative contracts, \u00a3(308)m net interest payable and a net \u00a381m profit from disposals of businsess from continuing operations.\n- -Taxation: Underlying taxation charge of \u00a3(48)m (2021: \u00a3(26)m). This reflects a tax charge on overseas profits of \u00a3(175)m and a tax credit due to increases in certain UK deferred tax assets of \u00a3127m. Deferred tax has not been recognised on current year UK tax losses. The tax charge in 2021 was driven by similar factors.",

The improvement at the Group level was principally due to higher flying hours in Civil Aerospace. Large engine flying hours increased by 35%, driving a \u00a31.3bn increase in invoiced EFH receipts (from \u00a32.3bn in 2021 to \u00a33.6bn in 2022). Large engine major shop visit volumes of 248 were 19% higher than in the prior year (2021: 208). The movement in provisions of \u00a3(23)m largely related to utilisation of the Trent 1000 provision and movements in the contract loss provisions. Other operating cash flow movement of \u00a341m included \u00a336m interest received, the \u00a3131m improvement year-on-year was mainly due to lower pension contributions and higher dividends received from joint ventures.\n- -Working capital \u00a3(0.5)bn, \u00a30.3bn better year-on-year. Supply chain disruption resulted in an increase in inventories through 2022, notably in Civil Aerospace and Power Systems, which partly unwound at the end of the year. This was partly offset by a net inflow across payables and receivables reflecting collections of overdue debts in Civil Aerospace (c\u00a3180m in 2022), increased advance payment receipts in Power Systems (a c\u00a3150m year-onyear benefit) and a \u00a363m advance payment received in Defence.\n\n- -Income tax of \u00a3(174)m, net cash tax payments in 2022 were \u00a3(174)m (2021: \u00a3(185)m).\n- -The capital element of lease payments was \u00a3(198)m, \u00a3(176)m lower than 2021 (\u00a3(374)m). In the prior year the elevated cost was driven by end of lease payments made on a small number of engines, as well as timing impacts on lease payments, with 2022 returning to more typical levels.\n- -Capital expenditure and investments of \u00a3(476)m, comprising \u00a3(302)m PPE additions net of disposals, \u00a3(202)m intangibles additions, partly offset by a net movement in investments of \u00a328m. The combined additions were similar to last year.\n- -Interest paid of \u00a3(352)m, including lease interest payments, similar to the \u00a3(331)m in 2021. Following the repayment of the \u00a32bn UK Export Finance backed loan in September 2022, we would expect interest paid to fall in 2023.\n- -Settlement of excess derivative contracts of \u00a3(326)m, down from \u00a3(452)m in 2021. The decrease was in line with previously communicated guidance and reflects the profile of derivative contracts taken out to reduce the size of the hedge book. In total \u00a3710m of excess derivative settlements are left to be settled between 2023 and 2026.",

Receivables increased  by  \u00a31.6bn  and  payables  increased  by  \u00a3(1.8)bn primarily driven by ITP Aero being external to the Group at yearend. Other drivers included higher trading volumes resulting in higher payables and receivables.\n- -Provisions: The \u00a3(751)m increase primarily reflected the adoption of the amendment to IAS 37 for Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract which increased contract loss provisions by \u00a3(723)m on 1 January 2022. The amendment clarifies that the direct cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and also an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.\n- -Net debt: Decreased from \u00a3(5.1)bn to \u00a3(3.3)bn driven by the completion of the disposal programme and free cash inflow of \u00a30.5bn. Our liquidity position is strong with \u00a38.1bn of liquidity including cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32.6bn and undrawn facilities of \u00a35.5bn. Net debt included \u00a3(1.8)bn of lease liabilities (2021: \u00a3(1.7)bn).\n- -Net financial assets and liabilities: A \u00a3(615)m increase in the net financial liabilities driven by a change in fair value of derivative contracts largely due to the impact of the movement in GBP:USD exchange rates, partly offset by deals that matured in the year.\n- -Net post-retirement scheme deficits :  A \u00a3(195)m increase in the net deficit driven by an increase in bond yields and inflation impacting both plan assets and obligations.\n- -Taxation: The net tax asset increased by \u00a3681m, most of which related to an increase in the deferred tax asset on unrealised losses on derivatives of \u00a3329m and certain other UK deferred tax assets of \u00a3118m reflecting tax relief that will be taken in the future, based on profit forecasts. There has also been a \u00a3165m decrease in deferred tax liabilities, the majority of which related to a reduction in the UK pension surplus.",

The business uses its engineering expertise, in-depth knowledge and capabilities to provide through-life service solutions for its customers.\n\na.  Large Engines\n\n70%\n\nb. Business Aviation\n\n21%\n\nc.  Regional\n\n4%\n\nd.  V2500\n\n5%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market overview\n\nThe Civil Aerospace market continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, recovery continued and our large engine flying hours (EFH) were 64% of 2019 levels, a solid improvement from 48% in 2021. The restrictions in China were a key hurdle to get back to pre-pandemic levels, along with increased staffing for airlines and airports to meet demand in countries that have largely recovered. Business aviation flying hours continue to be above 2019 levels and original equipment (OE) engine deliveries are increasing as expected with a strong start for our Pearl family of engines. Industry forecasts for the recovery in long-haul travel are positive with a predicted return to 2019 large engine flying levels in 2024.\n\nThe aerospace market was impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict which caused supply-chains to become strained and some raw materials have been in short supply for the whole industry. We have actively managed the disruption by having diversified sources of supply and through the use of hedging for near and mid-term price protection.\n\nInflation risk increased in 2022, with higher costs for energy, raw materials, freight and wages impacting our own costs and those of our suppliers. We manage inflation risk by having long-term contracts with our customers, suppliers and hedging counterparties and by having a cost aware culture that focuses on cost saving initiatives and efficiencies. As a result, we were able in part to protect margin against inflation in 2022. Our actions resulted in improvement in our long-term service agreement margins, which contributed to positive catch-ups in the year.\n\nMarket activity  for  large  engine  passenger  aircraft  is  now increasing, albeit from a low base as a result of the pandemic. OE deliveries rose by 15% year-on-year, with 165 Business aviation deliveries (2021: 114) and 190 total large engine deliveries (2021: 195). In 2022, we delivered 44 large spare engines (2021: 36), which represented 23% of total large engine deliveries (2021: 18%). This is above the typical range of 10% to 15% of total engine deliveries,\n\nas we grow the pool of spare engines to underpin fleet health and improve resilience. We expect this elevated level of spare engine deliveries to continue in 2023 and 2024.\n\nTotal shop visits were 1,044 versus 953 in 2021. There were 248 large engine major shop visits in 2022 versus 208 in 2021. In 2022, we agreed with Air China to create a joint-venture overhaul facility that will eventually support up to 250 shop visits per year.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nUnderlying revenue of \u00a35.7bn was up 25%. OE revenue of \u00a32.0bn was up 23% reflecting higher spare engine deliveries. Services revenue of \u00a33.7bn was up 26% on the prior year, reflecting higher large engine shop visits, aftermarket revenue growth from business aviation, regional and V2500, and positive LTSA catch-ups \u00a3360m, (2021: \u00a3214m).\n\nUnderlying operating profit was \u00a3143m (a 2.5% margin) versus a loss of \u00a3(172)m in 2021. The year-on-year increase was driven by improvements in LTSA contract margins, with an onerous provision credit of \u00a351m (2021: a \u00a3122m charge) and \u00a3319m of positive LTSA catch-ups (2021: \u00a3256m), a higher volume and different mix of large spare engine sales with more third party sales to capacity providers than in the prior year, increased aftermarket profit, and reduced losses on installed large engine OE deliveries. This was partly offset by the non-repeat of a foreign exchange revaluation credit of c\u00a3140m in 2021.\n\nTrading cash flow was \u00a3226m versus \u00a3(1,670)m in the prior year. The i mprovement was due to higher engine flying hour receipts reflecting the growth in LTSA flying hours, which grew at a materially faster rate than shop visits in 2022. Cash flows in 2022 benefited from the recovery of overdue balances from airlines incurred during the pandemic of c\u00a3180m.\n\nImprovements in underlying operating profit and cash flows were delivered despite the challenges associated with inflation and the supply chain, which are expected to persist in 2023.",

Around two thirds of these are covered by LTSA contracts, which provide aftermarket services for our customers for many years. Our order book in Civil Aerospace stands at 1,300 new large engines, due for delivery over the next few years.\n\nOE orders slowed during the COVID-19 pandemic but recovered substantially in 2022 with considerable orders from Malaysia Aviation Group, Norse Atlantic Airways and Qantas, as well as a large order with Air India in 2023. These OE orders also include TotalCare agreements, which will create value into the future and demonstrate a return in demand, which we expect to continue into 2023.\n\nIncreasing time on wing and reducing the cost of our maintenance activities are key value drivers in our aftermarket business model. In May, at our Civil Aerospace investor day, we talked about how product improvement, life limited parts extensions, enhancing temperature limits and better aircraft operations are all contributing to a greater time on wing. In addition, utilising lean engine overhaul methods, increased re-use of parts, more repair of parts and advanced repair technologies are reducing our shop visit costs.\n\nThe launch of the Airbus A350 as a freighter aircraft in 2022 was an important addition and gives us significant new opportunity in the freight market. Furthermore, we are seeing an increase in passenger to freighter conversions on the Airbus A330, which will keep our engines flying for longer and extend our aftermarket contracts.\n\nAs shop visit events return, we will assess the size of our operation and take action where required. We continue to grow our MRO network to support future shop visit volumes, for example the launch of our new MRO partnership with Air China.\n\nWe remain focused on the decarbonisation of the civil aerospace market and we will continue to collaborate with third parties to explore sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and clean propulsion systems. One of our commitments is to demonstrate that all of our Trent and Business Aviation engines are compatible with 100% SAF by the end of 2023. All our Trent and Business Aviation engines are already certified and ready to operate on a 50% SAF blend with traditional fossil-based aviation jet fuels. A recent agreement with Air bp will ensure that all fuel supplied for engine testing at our Derby, UK, Bristol, UK, and Dahlewitz, Germany, facilities will be 10% SAF. In addition, Air bp will also provide the fuel for the testing of our UltraFan demonstrator engine, which will be carried out entirely on SAF.\n\nIn business aviation, our Pearl 10X engine development programme continues to make good progress. The Pearl 10X, which is the newest member of the state-of-the-art Pearl family and the first of our engines to power a business aviation aircraft produced by Dassault, has surpassed its target thrust level on the first test run, making it the most powerful business aviation engine in our portfolio. Furthermore, the development programme has included rigorous testing of the new ultra-low emissions ALM combustor, which is compatible with 1 00% SAF. Further progress was made on our Pearl 700 development programme for the new Gulfstream G700/800, with EASA engine certification achieved in September 2022.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIndustry forecasts predict a continued recovery in international travel which is a key driver of our financial performance. In 2023, we expect large EFH to be in the range of 80% to 90% of the 2019 levels compared with 64% in 2022. Business and regional markets are expected to continue to perform above 2019 levels, with growth year-on-year.",

It has significant scale in naval and designs, supplies and supports the nuclear propulsion plant for all of the UK Royal Navy's nuclear submarines.\n\nUNDERLYING REVENUE\n\nUNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT\n\nORDER BACKLOG\n\n\u00a33,660m\n\n## \u00a3432m\n\n## \u00a38.5bn\n\n2021: \u00a33,368m\n\n2021: \u00a3457m\n\n2021: \u00a36.5bn\n\nUNDERLYING REVENUE MIX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market overview\n\nWe continue to be a trusted and key supplier to governments in the provision of defence power for the protection of society, preservation of peace and in underpinning economic and social stability. We operate with integrity in a tightly regulated and closely controlled industry in the provision of defence power. We remain long-term partners in the development, manufacture and maintenance of countries' defences, as we power critical military assets that deter threats and save lives.\n\nDefence budgets are increasing globally and this increased investment is providing for the long-term success of our Defence business and will underpin new contract wins to provide robust value to the Group over many decades. However, due to the long life of our Defence products and the availability and readiness of fleets currently, we are not immediately affected by changes to defence demand and governmental budget uplifts.\n\nThe defence market is long cycle, with production programmes spanning decades. Customer contracts typically range between one and five years and the Defence business has been going through a cycle of renewals. In 2022, contract renewals totalling USD1.8bn were agreed, including five additional years of support for the US Navy T-45 flight trainer aircraft and C-130J and KC-130J transport airport aircraft for the US Marine Corps and Kuwait. In addition, in 2022, we won a contract with the UK Ministry of Defence to provide support for our Adour engine which powers the Hawk Jet trainer aircraft. This 11-year contract, worth \u00a3105m, will enable us to provide the maintenance, repair and overhaul of the two Adour engines in service in the UK.\n\nThere was a high level of programme win activity in our Defence business in 2022, with the end of the year seeing announcements that will underpin the long-term outlook for the business. The Bell V-280 Valor, powered by our AE1107F engines, was selected by the US Army for the future long range assault aircraft programme.\n\nUNDERLYING REVENUE MIX BY SECTOR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na.

Australia concluded negotiations for the first deliveries of the Australian Hunter frigate programme which will be powered by our MT30 gas turbine engine.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOrder intake in our Defence business was \u00a35.4bn in 2022 versus \u00a32.3bn in 2021, with a book-to-bill of 1.5x versus 0.7x last year. The Bell V-280 Valor, powered by our AE1107F engines, was selected by the US Army for the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft programme. Major contract awards included the renewal of $1.8bn of services contracts in the U.S. for trainer and transport aircraft over the next five years. These awards, combined with increased military activity and spending underpin the long-term outlook for the business. Our order backlog at the year end was \u00a38.5bn, with 86% order cover in 2023 and a high degree of cover in 2024 and beyond.\n\nRevenue increased 2% to \u00a33.7bn. OE revenue was up 10% year-onyear, with strong growth in Submarines along with new programmes (including B-52 and UK Combat). This more than offset reductions in services revenue, down 3% due to the non-repeat of legacy spare parts sales made in 2021.\n\nOperating profit was \u00a3432m (11.8% margin) versus \u00a3457m (13.6% margin) in the prior year, reflecting the non-repeat of \u00a345m of high margin one time legacy spare parts sales in the prior year and the changing mix of the business. Self-funded R&D and investment levels were elevated, as we support growth across the portfolio including the UK Future Combat programme and opportunities in North America.\n\nTrading cash flow of \u00a3426m improved versus \u00a3377m last year, despite slightly lower underlying profit and increased inventory, due to an advance payment from one of our customers of \u00a363m.",

Rolls-Royce does not provide or manufacture weapons for our customers.\n\nOur position in the US has been further solidified with the completion of a major investment programme in our naval facilities in Pascagoula, Mississippi and Walpole, Massachusetts. These will provide increased capability and capacity to meet US Navy demand for the manufacture of propellers and propulsion components for their naval platforms. These investments, in addition to the previous investment made in our Indianapolis facility, mean we are well positioned to provide the US Department of Defence with worldclass products and services for decades to come.\n\nA new market opening up for us is participation in the manufacture of advanced nuclear microreactors for deployable military applications and base power in the US. We are proud to be a key part of a contract awarded by the US Department of Defense to build the first full-scale transportable microreactor prototype for delivery in 2024, developing technology which will enable militaries to become untethered from fossil fuels and increase their energy resilience. The transportable microreactor will also have potential for commercial applications such as disaster recovery and remote location power coverage.\n\nIn November, the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine helped the Royal Air Force and industry partners carry out a world-first 100% sustainable fuel flight using a military aircraft of its size, and the first of any aircraft type in the UK.\n\nOur Defence site at Bristol, UK became the first Rolls-Royce production facility to achieve net zero carbon status on operational emissions (excluding product test emissions) during the year. The site utilises a combination of rooftop solar and onsite ground source heat pumps, alongside the procurement of renewable electricity and gas. A small quantity (<10%) of independently verified carbon offsets were used to achieve net zero carbon status where there is  no  immediately  viable  alternative  to  mitigating  residual emissions, such as diesel usage in emergency generators. We will apply learnings from the decarbonisation of operations at Bristol, UK, to the wider estate to help support our goal of reaching net zero facility emissions by 2030.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOur Defence business is resilient, with many programmes already in place stretching out over future decades. Our order book is strong at \u00a38.5bn and order coverage is 86% for 2023. Increased government spending on military and defence applications provides confidence for the future, as we look to take an ever-increasing role in the protection of society, whilst pursuing lower carbon solutions for our customers.\n\nIn the UK, we opened our nuclear skills academy based in Derby to enhance the pipeline of talent in this field. The academy has funding to take on 200 apprentices each year for the next ten years and will be a key enabler as we explore solutions to satisfy the growing demand of society for clean, carbon-free energy.\n\nIn July, at the Farnborough Air Show, the UK Government's defence, science and technology laboratory and the UK's national security strategic investment fund announced a joint programme to deliver significant enhancements to UK defence capabilities through the development of innovative hypersonic technologies. Rolls-Royce is partnered with Reaction Engines and the Royal Air Force's rapid capabilities office on the hypersonic air vehicle experimental programme which aims to establish the UK as a leader in reusable hypersonic air systems.",

We monitor our supply chain closely and expect these inventory levels to begin to unwind in 2023 as we balance financial health with meeting the needs of our customers.\n\nPart of the Power Systems supply chain has been impacted by the Chinese economy closing and reopening through 2022. As a result of this, and industry-wide pressures on the supply chain, our Power Systems business suffered heightened disruption to its production and output. This led to a larger amount of inventory being held in our Power Systems business, as we waited for parts input to complete orders and ship these to our customers. The reopening of the Chinese economy and manufacturing facilities across Greater China towards the end of 2022 is a promising signal that disruption will be more limited going forward. We continue to monitor the situation closely and will take mitigating action to limit disruption to our customers, whilst maintaining appropriate levels of inventory across the business.\n\nUNDERLYING REVENUE MIX BY SECTOR\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na.  Power Generation\n\n34%\n\nb.  Marine\n\n31%\n\nc.  Industrial\n\n25%\n\nd.  Defence\n\n10%\n\n## Financial performance\n\nOrder intake in our Power Systems business was \u00a34.3bn, 29% higher than the prior year, a record level for the business. We saw strong demand in many of our end markets, notably Power Generation i ncluding mission critical backup power, and for our engine systems and services. As a result, we now have 76% order cover for 2023.\n\nUnderlying revenue was \u00a33.3bn, up 23% and above the previous peak in 2019. Services revenues grew 16% as product utilisation increased in our end markets, and OE revenue rose by 26%. Sales were strongest in the industrial and power generation end markets, partly offset by lower activity in China.\n\nOperating profit was \u00a3281m (8.4% margin) versus \u00a3242m (8.8% margin) in the prior year. The lower margin versus the prior year reflects higher costs associated with inflation and supply chain disruption, increased self-funded R&D, one-off charges including intangible asset impairments and write-downs of assets due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, partly offset by the benefit of higher volumes.\n\nTrading cash flow was \u00a3158m, a conversion ratio of 56% versus 90% l ast year. The lower conversion year-on-year reflects a higher level of inventories due to supply chain disruption and the pace of revenue growth, partly offset by increased customer advance payments.",

Key contract wins strengthen our market position and secure future demand. Notable contract wins include more than 500 mtu engines for the UK's future Boxer tanks, a service partnership with the Royal Navy and the extension of a frame agreement with world leading luxury yacht manufacturer, Ferretti Group. These are i n addition to the supply of a new large-scale battery storage system for Dutch energy supplier Semperpower.\n\nOur pathway to net zero remains a priority. This year the world's first hybrid diesel-battery-electric regular passenger operation train ran from London to Aylesbury in the UK with mtu Hybrid PowerPacks, reducing CO2 emissions by up to 25%. We also took a 54% stake of German electrolyzer stack company Hoeller Elektrolyzer to develop mtu electrolyzers for producing green hydrogen. Furthermore, we announced the development of mtu methanol engines for large yachts and mtu hydrogen engines for power generation.\n\nLast year, we pledged to prove that our most successful engine series can be used with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023. In 2022, we took significant steps towards meeting our net zero ambitions by reaching key milestones, including the achievement of our series 4000 and series 1600 engines having run on a range of sustainable synthetic fuels.\n\nIn 2022, we signed a contract with a solar park with 3.7 MWp capacity in southern Germany, which will generate around four million kilowatt hours of electricity per year for Power Systems. This power generation source saves 1,300 tonnes of CO2 per year compared to electricity available through the German grid network.\n\nFor our efforts to drive decarbonisation, Power Systems has been awarded the special global transition high potential prize which recognises companies that have taken practical steps in their strategies to prevent global warming by more than 1.5\u00b0C by the year 2100.\n\nWe are prepared to support the increasing customer demands for military products as a result of the shift in security policy. We will do this in a timely and reliable manner, ensuring that our Power Systems business contributes to global security. mtu solutions power many of the vehicles and vessels on which operational readiness depends.\n\n## Outlook\n\nAs customers look to ensure a continuous source of power for their applications, we are well placed to take advantage of increasing demand. Inventory unwind began in 2022 and will continue through 2023.",

As we develop greener solutions for future use, nuclear and electrification applications will play a pivotal role in our product mix and make-up. We continue to invest in these technologies along with our partners and we use our combined expertise to progress on the path to net zero.\n\nNuclear power will play a key role in producing sustainable zero carbon power. Our SMRs will enable the production of stable, secure supplies of power for grid scale electricity supply and off-grid energy intensive users. They are faster to build and more cost-efficient than conventional nuclear power stations. The modular design means that 90% of the manufacturing can take place in a factory environment, not subject to the productivity constraints of conventional large nuclear sites such as poor weather. While we await the first firm commitment to deploy an SMR, we continue to work in parallel through the UK generic design assessment (GDA) process, with a view to having the first SMRs on grid in the early 2030s.\n\nElectrification will assist in the decarbonisation of the aviation industry and the technologies we develop here can be leveraged in our Civil Aerospace and Defence applications. We pursue solutions on multiple fronts, where small, all-electric aircraft can offer short journeys, with a more efficient, quieter and zero-emissions power source. As we look to increase the range of the aircraft, hybrid power systems, such as electric and SAF pairings can provide commercially viable alternative solutions to the traditional larger, regional aircraft market. Within Rolls-Royce Electrical we continue to build on existing relationships and create new ones, to collaborate with expert third parties to develop electric solutions as a means of air travel. We also use this engineering capability to support product development in Power Systems, where there is increased demand for hybrid systems which can leverage our electrical engineering capability in Rolls-Royce Electrical.\n\nThere was a tightening of the labour market in 2022, where job vacancies were higher, unemployment was lower and the availability of skilled workers was lower. As a result, our New Markets business faced greater challenges in filling some vacancies than our other business. Progress has been slower than anticipated, therefore, but not materially lower to impact our progression against key milestones.\n\nThe potential from our New Market products is significant and the technologies we develop in Rolls-Royce SMR and in Rolls-Royce Electrical can have alternative applications.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nUnderlying revenue of \u00a33m came from Rolls-Royce Electrical sales relating to marine engineering services and propulsion systems. Both Rolls-Royce Electrical and Rolls-Royce SMR are early-stage businesses in their investment phase, with significant future revenue generating potential in the 2030s.\n\nUnderlying operating loss of \u00a3(132)m increased from the prior year comparative as we increased the pace of investment in both RollsRoyce SMR and Rolls-Royce Electrical. R&D costs of \u00a3108m included \u00a341m on the design development to ready our SMRs to enter the UK GDA process and \u00a367m on electrical propulsion technology.\n\n## Operational and strategic progress\n\nCollaboration will play a key role in our Rolls-Royce Electrical journey, and we look to partner with experts across the industry to further advance our technology and explore different avenues for net zero travel. We entered into partnership this year with EVE, an advanced air mobility (AAM) business created by Embraer S.A., to develop propulsion systems for their platform. Together with our existing propulsion partnership, Vertical Aerospace, we are well positioned to deliver differentiating power and propulsion solutions in this new AAM market.",

The partnership will leverage our aviation and certification capabilities and Hyundai Motor Group's hydrogen fuel cell technologies and industrialisation capability. The benefits of using a hydrogen fuel cell system in an all-electric aircraft propulsion system is that it is a zero-emission, silent and reliable on-board power source that enables scalability in power offerings as well as long distance flight range. Jointly we will advance this technology into Hyundai's AAM vehicles and complete our all-electric and hybrid-electric power and propulsion system portfolio offerings.\n\nIncreased investment in Rolls-Royce Electrical is a key part of our net zero strategy. This year we announced the development of our turbogenerator technology. A new, small engine designed for hybrid-electric application, the turbogenerator, will extend platform range initially based upon SAFs and, at a later date, will be compatible with hydrogen fuel. The technology, currently being developed by experts in Germany, Norway and Hungary, is being part funded by the German Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action.\n\nWe have shortlisted three possible sites which will be home to one of our major factories in the production of our SMR components and modules. Planning processes will be initiated to ensure we can work in parallel and construction will take place once certainty on a domestic deployment plan has been secured. In addition to factory locations, four nuclear sites have been identified across England and Wales that could host the first SMR units with sufficient land for around 15GW of SMR deployment across these sites. These are key milestones in the development of our SMR programme and  support  our  ambitions  to  manufacture  the  first  fully operational SMR in the early 2030s.\n\n## Outlook\n\nIn  Rolls-Royce SMR, regulatory activities such as the GDA, factory development and siting plans will continue simultaneously as the work to secure a firm domestic commitment is secured. For Rolls-Royce Electrical, partnership and commercial opportunities will be developed, as we look to draw upon our own talent and the talent of others to bring our ambition to life.",

Delivery  of  our  sustainability  approach,  including execution of policies and progress against our priorities and targets, is overseen by the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee (see page 96) at Board level, and the environment & sustainability committee, which operates as a subset of the Executive Team to monitor progress routinely at management level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur sustainability approach and areas of focus are kept under constant review to respond to immediate and emerging trends, such as changes in legislation, as part of a dynamic materiality assessment. This is continuously assessed to ensure we are meeting the expectations of our customers, investors, regulators and our people, and is reviewed by the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee. This also helps to inform our reporting and disclosures.\n\nWe seek to engage our people in our sustainability approach to understand their expectations and feedback on our progress, and to empower them to contribute through their individual and team roles. In 2022, we launched dedicated sustainability and climate content hubs as part of our digital learning platform, Leatro (see page 38), and established a communication campaign, 'sustainability & I', focused on showcasing the individual perspectives, drivers and contributions that people across the Group can make to our sustainability approach.\n\nThroughout 2022, we have particularly focused on two areas of evolving global policy and growing strategic significance: continued progress against our decarbonisation strategy, execution of our climate programme and development of science-based targets (see Net Zero and Climate Change pages 31 to 35); and establishment of a global human rights development programme (see Ethics and Compliance section page 41). These activities will continue into 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our sustainability approach, including our Group policies, materiality assessment, and metrics and targets, see www.rolls-royce.com",

        "page_content": "## NET ZERO AND CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nWe aim to play a leading role in the global transition to a low carbon future, through the provision of sustainable power and technology solutions, and are committed to reaching net zero value chain emissions by 2050.\n\n## Making our operations net zero carbon\n\n## OUR PROGRESS IN 2022\n\nReleased mtu Series 4000 and 1600 reciprocating engines for use on a range of sustainable fuels in power generation applications\n\nCompleted first successful test flight of the Trent 700 powered RAF Voyager aircraft on 100% SAF, in partnership with the UK Ministry of Defence and Royal Airforce\n\nCarried out first ground test of an AE2100 aero engine on green hydrogen\n\nAchieved 61% reduction in facility emissions (scope 1 + 2, excluding product test emissions) from 2014\n\nMitigating our impact on climate change and decarbonising our product portfolio are intrinsically linked to our business strategy and are the biggest drivers of our sustainability approach.\n\nDuring 2022, we have concentrated on the development of a climate programme that will ensure we are appropriately responding to the impacts of climate change on our business, including both the risk and opportunity it presents. To support this, a climate steering committee has been established with Executive Team representation, including the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Technology Officer and the General Counsel. Key outputs from this programme include further work to quantify the potential impact of climate scenarios on our strategic planning and the development of science-based targets to enable us to effectively monitor progress against our decarbonisation goals.\n\nOur decarbonisation strategy summarises our approach to managing climate-related impacts and risk through three interconnected pillars:\n\n- 1. making our operations net zero carbon;\n- 2.   decarbonising complex, critical systems at the heart of global society by:\n- a.   enabling our products to be used in a way that is compatible with net zero;\n- b.   pioneering  new  breakthrough  technologies  that  can accelerate the global energy transition; and\n- 3.   creating the necessary enabling environment, with public and policy support, to achieve this ambition.\n\nEmissions associated with our office, manufacturing and production activities are a small, but important, step in our journey to a net zero carbon value chain. Reducing the energy needs and climate impacts of our facilities will also help ensure they are more resilient to rising energy prices and energy insecurity.\n\nOur total scope 1 + 2 emissions footprint for 2022 equalled 319 ktCO2e. Of this, 175 ktCO2e (55%) came from facility emissions and 144 ktCO2 e (45%) from product testing activities \u00b9.\n\nBy 2030, our goal is to achieve net zero facility emissions (see page 32). During the year, we made good progress against this, despite the rising costs caused by the volatile energy pricing around the world. This included upgrading lighting systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and conducting feasibility studies into deployment of technologies such as large scale solar, battery storage and renewable heat networks. During 2022, our Defence site at Bristol, UK became our first production facility to achieve net zero carbon status for operational emissions (excluding emissions from product testing activities). The site utilises a combination of rooftop solar and onsite ground source heat pumps, alongside the procurement of renewable electricity and gas. A small quantity of independently verified carbon offsets (covering <10% of total emissions) were used to achieve net zero carbon status where there is no immediately viable alternative to mitigate residual emissions, such as diesel usage in emergency generators. During the year, we also entered an offtake agreement for the exclusive supply of renewable energy for our Power Systems facility in Friedrichshafen, Germany from two neighbouring solar parks. This supplies around a third of the site's total energy needs.\n\nAs part of our science-based target setting, we aim to replace our existing facilities-focused goal with a revised target to reduce total scope 1 + 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline \u00b2 (see overleaf). This target will be met primarily through the roadmaps that have been already identified for decarbonising facility emissions but also brings product test emissions into scope for the first time.\n\nWe undertake rigorous programmes of product testing as part of our technology development programmes, as well as to support customer deliveries, meet regulatory requirements and for engine certification purposes. This is a critical part of our product safety assurance programme. Emissions associated with product test can be mitigated through a combination of increasingly digital testing, use of sustainable fuels in our test beds and the growth of our low and zero carbon technology portfolio, such as hybrid and fully electric products. In the UK, we are already using a blend of 10% SAF in our Civil Aerospace and Defence testing activities.\n\nThrough the climate programme and wider activities, we have taken action against each of these elements during the year.\n\n- \u00b9 This data excludes ITP Aero in line with 2022 financial reporting as it was classified as a discontinued business in 2021\n- \u00b2 Target awaiting validation from the Science-Based Targets initiative and therefore subject to change",

Statutory  GHG  emissions  data,  including emissions from these sources, are detailed on page 200\n- 2 External assurance over scope 1 + 2 GHG data is provided by Bureau Veritas. See page 199 for their sustainability assurance statement\n- 3 Data has been reported in accordance with our basis of reporting, available at www.rolls-royce.com/sustainability\n- 4 ITP Aero is classified as a discontinued business and is therefore excluded from the scope of our target. For the purposes of SECR disclosures, it is included in statutory GHG emissions data up to the date of disposal, as detailed on page 170. Bergen Engines and Civil Nuclear were sold in 2021 and are, therefore, excluded from the scope of our targets. Historical data has been restated to reflect this\n\n## Decarbonising complex, critical systems\n\nAchieving net zero carbon will require a wholesale transformation of the systems that make up the backbone of our global economy, including transport, energy and the built environment, some of the very sectors in which reducing emissions is the hardest. To decarbonise complex, critical systems we must continue to act across three areas: developing new low and zero carbon technologies and sustainable solutions; accelerating the availability and affordability of sustainable fuels; and continuing to improve engine efficiency and environmental performance.\n\nTo align with global climate goals and meet our own commitments under the UN Race to Zero, all our products must be compatible with net zero carbon operation by 2050 at the latest. This will be achieved by further advancing the efficiency and performance of our engine portfolio and ensuring our products can run on sustainable fuels.\n\nThroughout 2022, and in collaboration with industry partners, we have conducted a series of one-off tests across our portfolio of in-production and in-development engines to demonstrate their readiness for 100% sustainable fuels. This includes the Trent XWB-84 and Trent 900 in Civil Aerospace, the Pearl 700 and the BR725 for business aviation and a successful in-flight test of the Trent 700 powered Royal Airforce Voyager aircraft in Defence. In Power Systems, we announced the release of our mtu Series 4000 and Series 1600 reciprocating diesel engines for use with a range of synthetic diesel fuels in power generation applications.\n\nThese tests, alongside our use of 10% SAF in our Civil Aerospace and Defence testing facilities in the UK, demonstrate that it is not a technology challenge to increase the uptake of sustainable fuels in transport and power generation applications but one of economics and policy. The cost of sustainable fuels is expected to be potentially significantly higher than today's oil prices and is produced in relatively limited quantities compared to conventional fossil fuels. It is critical, therefore, that we continue to invest in advanced efficiency technologies that can help reduce fuel burn in product operation.\n\nBy 2030, our goal is to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from all energy purchased and consumed in the operation of our buildings, facilities and manufacturing processes (facility emissions, excluding product test). This target is well aligned with the emissions reduction trajectory required to curb global temperature rise to 1.5\u00baC. We are aiming to achieve our goal through on-site renewable energy installations, the procurement of renewable energy and continued implementation of energy efficiency improvements to reduce our overall energy demands and associated costs.\n\nIn 2022, the emissions associated with our operations and facilities target was 175 ktCO2e. This is a 2 ktCO2e reduction (1.1%) from 2021.\n\nAs part of our science-based target setting, we aim to replace our existing facilities-focused goal with a revised target to reduce total scope 1 + 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, from a 2019 baseline *, bringing test emissions into the scope of our target for the first time. We will continue to work to target net zero GHG emissions from our operations a nd facilities within the same timescale.\n\n- * Target awaiting validation from the Science-Based Targets initiative and therefore subject to change\n\nThroughout 2022, we have continued to progress through the design stages of our UltraFan demonstrator package, the next generation of gas turbine technology for aviation, which will offer a 25% reduction in fuel burn compared to the first Trent engines. In our business aviation segment, the Pearl 10X engine has been developed utilising advanced technologies, such as our Advance2 engine core and advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing, to offer 5% higher efficiency than its predecessor.\n\nBeyond mitigating the emissions associated with the use of today's products, we believe we are well positioned to play a critical role in accelerating the global energy transition through the introduction and scaling of new breakthrough technologies. This includes the development of new low, zero or even net negative products and solutions, such as fuel cells and microgrids for energy storage, hybrid-electric and all-electric technologies for commuter aviation and urban air mobility applications, direct air capture technology, and small modular nuclear reactors for large scale power generation. All of these offer great opportunities in markets or market segments we are not present in today.\n\n## Creating an enabling environment\n\nOur ability to deliver on our decarbonisation roadmap hinges on an external environment that enables us to successfully transition to a net zero carbon future and to support others to do the same. We recognise that factors such as the provision and uptake of sustainable fuels or the inclusion of nuclear power in clean energy strategies is outside the immediate control of any one company.\n\nIn response, we continue to engage with partners across our value chain, including policy makers, to help create the necessary regulatory landscape and public sentiment. In 2022, this included active participation at the UNFCCC COP27 conference in Egypt; hosting clean technology showcases for political stakeholders in the UK and Europe; and publicly welcoming the announcement of the long-term goal to reach net zero carbon from the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the UN body that oversees global aviation.",

        "page_content": "## TCFD RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThrough our ongoing climate programme and wider activities during 2022, we have worked to build on and improve our strategic response to climate change and in turn our disclosures against the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.\n\nI n our 2021 Annual Report, we stated that our climate disclosures were in line with nine of the 11 TCFD recommendations. The two areas we felt our disclosures were inconsistent were strategy part C, related to the assessment of organisational resilience in the face of climate change and metrics and targets, part B, related to the disclosure of scope 3 emissions. A key focus of our climate programme, climate steering committee and Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee throughout the year has been in strengthening these two areas. As a result, we have made considerable progress on the integration of climate within our routine strategic and financial planning activities, and in the calculation of scope 3, category 11 use of sold products emissions.\n\nAgainst the latter, we have disclosed the impact of our scope 3, category 11 use of sold products, calculated in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. As our category 11 emissions are most material, comprising >90% of our total emissions footprint, we have concluded this disclosure meets the TCFD recommendation to calculate and disclose appropriate scope 3 emissions sources. Targets for reducing these emissions have been developed and submitted for validation by the Science-Based Targets initiative, and are disclosed as draft.\n\nAgainst strategy part C, we have sought to build on the work undertaken in 2021 where we had completed a preliminary, largely qualitative, assessment of the impact of climate-related risk under climate scenarios. For 2022, we have substantiated the two climate scenarios we use for strategic planning, one of which explores an accelerated transition pathway linked to global temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, the other accelerated physical risk linked to global temperature rise of 3.6\u00b0C by 2100, with further quantitative and qualitative inputs. These inputs, on variables such as anticipated carbon prices ($/t) and global GDP, have been taken from external sources, including Oxford Economics and the International Energy Agency, and are then used to model Group-specific assumptions such as demand for aviation and maritime transport. Each business has modelled these variables in detail to understand the extent to which each scenario manifests as a risk and, if so, how material.\n\nHowever, as set out elsewhere in this Strategic Report, including the Chair's Statement (see page 4) and the Chief Executive's Review (see page 6), at the start of 2023 we announced the commencement of a strategic review and wider transformation programme. This will include identifying and assessing strategic options, prioritising growth opportunities and assessing current portfolio attractiveness; much of which relates to the decarbonisation of our product portfolio and the wider opportunities the energy transition presents (see Strategy, page 10). The results of this review will include developing a new, granular strategic plan with clearly defined milestones and key performance indicators to enable the measurement of progress. This will be developed throughout the course of 2023. At this time therefore it would be unreasonable to conclude that we have fully considered the impact of climate change within our business strategy while that strategy is under review.\n\nAs a result, we believe our 2022 disclosures are consistent with nine of the 11 TCFD recommendations. The two areas where we consider that we are not fully aligned are: strategy, part B, relating to the consideration of the impact of climate in business strategy; and, strategy, part C, relating to the assessment of organisational resilience in the face of climate change.\n\nPlaying a key role in the energy transition remains a strategic priority (see Strategy, page 12). Climate - that is both the consideration of the impact of climate on our business, including strategic planning, risk management and governance; and consideration of the impact of our strategic choices on the climate, including carbon emissions - will be a key consideration throughout the strategic review.\n\nFor 2022, we have taken the decision to detail our climate-related disclosures in a supplementary Climate Review, available at www.rolls-royce.com. This enables us to disclose further detail on our approach to climate-related governance, strategy, risk management and metrics & targets, supported by case studies and examples of in-year activity, than the Annual Report format allows. A summary of these disclosures, and details of where within the Climate Review further information can be found, is included overleaf. This includes the most material information pertinent to our strategic response to climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our strategic response to climate change see our Climate Review on www.rolls-royce.com\n\nIn these assessments, eight key risks and two key opportunities relating to climate change have been considered. Each business has modelled the potential impact of each risk and/or opportunity against their strategic and financial plans under each scenario, the outputs of which have then been consolidated and assessed at Group-level for disclosure. This has included consideration of the impact of climate in the preparation of the Going Concern and Viability Statements, as well as in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A summary of the consideration of climate within our accounting policies is detailed in note 1 on pages 110 to 112. It is our assessment that we have met the principles of the TCFD recommendations through these activities.",

Further information on our strategic review can be found on page 11\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board oversight\n\nThe Board has oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities impacting the Group and all Board Committees have climate-related issues as part of their remit. In particular, the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee has delegated responsibility to review the principal risk relating to climate change. During the year, this Committee was specifically engaged in the development of our proposed science-based targets and reviewed the outputs of climate-related physical risk impact assessments, making recommendations for further modelling. Directors received climate training during the year, covering climate science, risk management and scenarios.\n\n## Management's role\n\nThe Executive Team is responsible for managing climate-related risks and opportunities on a day-to-day basis and for delivering the roadmaps to achieve our decarbonisation strategy. The Chief Executive has specific risk ownership of the principal risk related to climate change. The environment & sustainability committee is a sub-committee of the Executive Team and meets regularly to review progress. In addition, a subset of the Executive Team meets on a monthly basis as the climate steering committee to specifically review our climate programme. In addition, we benefit from the expertise of an independent external environmental advisory committee, which reviews and advises management on our sustainability and climate approach.\n\n## Identification of climate risks and opportunities\n\nThe assessment and management of climate-related risk and opportunity is an integral part of our enterprise risk management process. A principal risk related to climate change, specifically the potential of risk to future revenue changes as a result of failure to transition to an inherently lower carbon product portfolio, is specifically noted on our Group risk register. Further details on the climate related principal risk can be found on page 44.\n\nBroader climate-related risks and opportunities can manifest themselves beyond those described in our climate change principal risk and can also act as drivers for other principal risks. For example, extreme weather events disrupting our supply chain (business continuity), carbon taxes reducing the competitiveness of our products (competitive environment), or shifts in consumer preferences reducing the size of the accessible market (market shock).\n\nTo reflect this broader impact, we have consolidated a long list of potential identified climate risks into eight key risks. These represent the key hazards that could have a potentially material impact. These are: increased costs due to carbon pricing; reduced revenues due to changing customer demand; increased costs due to commodity price changes; regulatory changes on types of engines; product performance deterioration under changing physical climate; increased investment required in R&T/D; increased capital investment required due to changes in product mix and/or volume; and changes to demand for low carbon products.\n\nAdditional  opportunities  were  identified  including  increased  market  demand  for  existing  products  and opportunities to enter new markets through the development of new low or zero emissions products.\n\n## Consideration of the impact of climate risks and opportunities\n\nThe potential  impact  of  climate-related  risks  and  opportunities  is  quantified  as  part  of  our  enterprise  risk management. This includes consideration of probability and impact against which we define thresholds for what we consider to be substantive. Our tolerance for risk depends on the nature of the risk itself, as well as the potential impact and likelihood of its occurrence. Through our work on climate scenarios in 2022, we have assessed the potential impact of each of the eight key risks relating to climate change identified, seeking to quantify potential impact, understanding the trajectory and timeframe over which we expect the risk to occur and seeking to understand and assess the existing strategic response and controls in place.\n\n## Resilience assessment, including climate-related scenarios\n\nWe use climate scenarios to quantify the impact of climate-related risks and thereby assess the viability of our business strategy, decarbonisation plans, our approach to managing climate-related risk and their impact on our financial results. Two scenarios have been developed based on independent external climate scenarios and representative concentration pathways that present plausible levels of global temperature rise and associated policy responses. One scenario explores an accelerated transition pathway linked to global temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, the other accelerated physical risk linked to global temperature rise of 3.6\u00b0C by 2100.\n\nIn 2022, we have sought to further quantify each scenario, using third-party data where relevant, to assess better the potential impact of the eight risks relating to climate change. Both scenarios present risk and opportunity for the Group that is used to inform our strategic planning and decision making. Our assessment concludes that under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, transition risks including increased costs due to carbon pricing; reduced revenues due to changing customer behaviour; increased costs due to commodity pricing; regulatory changes on types of engines; and increased investment required in R&T/D are potentially material. In the 3.6\u00b0C scenario physical risks, such as product performance deterioration under a changing climate, are material.\n\nWe have then sought to assess the existing strategic response and controls in place to mitigate each risk. From this we have concluded that largely the actual impact of each risk is likely to be low or medium. Where relevant or material, potential impacts have been recognised in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Further information on our consideration of climate change can be found in note 1 of the Accounting Policies on page 110 to 112.",

Risks are identified across businesses and functions by considering what may prevent us achieving our strategic, operational or compliance objectives. They may be identified through a range of processes, including horizon planning, subject matter expertise (such as that provided by our environmental advisory committee), stakeholder engagement and through climate scenario modelling. Once identified, we assess the risk's likelihood and potential impact, determining whether it may manifest as a threat or an opportunity, reviewing and taking into account current mitigating control activities and identifying where additional action may be needed. Threats are routinely reviewed to determine whether they are within our risk appetite.\n\nDuring 2022, we also carried out preliminary physical risk impact assessments on selected Company locations and third-party sites, such as key joint ventures and supplier locations. These assessments considered the potential likelihood and impact of weather events such as flooding, severe storms, wildfires and extreme heat based on the central grid reference of the location. Of the 50 sites assessed, eight were identified as presenting a potential high level of risk. There is further work underway to improve the specificity of these hazards and identify mitigating actions as part of our ongoing assessment and response to business continuity risk.\n\n## Processes for managing climate-related risks\n\nRisk owners assess the risk's likelihood and potential impact, taking into account current mitigating control activities and identifying where additional activities may be needed. The Chief Executive is the risk owner for the climate-related principal risk and the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee has delegated oversight.\n\n## Integration of climate-related risk management into enterprise risk management\n\nClimate-related risk identification and assessment is embedded within our wider approach to enterprise risk management. This looks to understand the risks to our objectives and sets common assessment criteria to ensure all risks, including those arising from climate change, are consistently assessed. Further detail on our approach to enterprise risk management can be found on pages 42 to 47.\n\n## Disclosures of metrics used to assess climate risks and opportunities\n\nWe monitor selected metrics relevant to our climate change principal risk, specifically the potential of risk to future revenue changes as a result of failure to transition to an inherently lower carbon product portfolio, and to the key risks related to climate change determined to be potentially material. For 2022, this includes assessing the carbon intensity of our product and technology portfolio through metrics such as:\n\n- -use of sold products emissions normalised by original equipment revenue (fossil fuel based pathway): 0.015 MtCO2e/ \u00a3m OE revenue; and\n- -percentage of net R&D expenditure allocated to the development of energy transition products and services: 74% (2021: 72%).\n\n## Disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions\n\nWe monitor and measure our GHG impacts across relevant categories. For 2022, our emissions were:\n\n- -Scope 1: 233 ktCO2 e\n- -Scope 2 (location based): 86 ktCO2 e\n- -Scope 3, category 11 (use of sold products):\n- \u00b7 Fossil fuel based pathway: 87.3 MtCO2 e\n- \u00b7 Sustainable fuels based pathway: 70.1 MtCO2 e\n\nThese  emissions  have  been  calculated  in  accordance  with  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Protocol.  Due  to  the forward looking nature of scope 3, category 11 emissions calculations in particular, we have reported against two differing projections of sustainable fuels uptake. These act as bookends by calculating emissions against a 100% fossil fuel based pathway out to 2050 and a near 100% sustainable fuel based pathway out to 2050.\n\nWe continue to focus on improving the rigour of our emissions calculations and reporting, particularly related to scope 3 emissions. For 2022, we have focused on preparing our scope 3, category 11 (use of sold products) emissions as the most material aspect of our total emissions footprint (>90%). In 2023, we will focus on further scope 3 emissions categories, particularly category 1 purchased goods and services.\n\n## Targets used to manage climate risks and opportunities\n\nOur climate strategy is  supported by a suite of  short  and  medium  term  targets  intended  to  help  measure and accelerate progress. This includes targets to mitigate emissions, build strategic resilience and capability development in relation to climate change. Our 2023 targets, which include targets related to the testing of products on 100% sustainable fuels, form part of executive remuneration.\n\nWe have made good progress against our existing facility emissions target and broader environmental targets, such as energy and waste reduction, each of which have an inherent climate impact. Since 2014 we have reduced our facility emissions (scope 1 + 2, excluding test) by 61%, and are on track to meet our 2030 goal.\n\nIn June 2022, we developed and submitted new science-based decarbonisation targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative for validation. We expect these to be finalised in 2023. Our proposed interim targets include reducing scope 1 + 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, and reducing scope 3, category 11 (use of sold products) emissions, normalised by original equipment revenues, by 55% by 2030 *.",

Where appropriate, progress against these focus areas is monitored through Group-wide environmental targets.\n\n## ENERGY CONSUMPTION (MWh/\u00a3m)\n\n## TOTAL SOLID AND LIQUID WASTE (t/\u00a3m)\n\n## RECYCLING & RECOVERY RATE (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Target :\n\nReduce total energy consumption, normalised by revenue, by 50% by 2025 1,2,3,4\n\nIn a period of continued challenges around energy security and rising energy costs, reducing our overall energy demand will help reduce our exposure to energy-related risk, as well as support the delivery of our decarbonisation goals. Our normalised energy consumption in 2022 was 76 MWh/\u00a3m. This represents a reduction of 352,579 MWh (25.6%) since 2014. The total amount of energy consumed in the year was 1 , 0 2 5 ,783 MWh, of which 30.8% came from renewable energy sources, including 0.9% generated from our own on-site clean energy installations.\n\n## Target:\n\nReduce total solid and liquid waste production, normalised by revenue, by 25% by 2025 1,2,3,4\n\nWe continue to focus on opportunities to prevent and minimise waste generation. In 2022, our total normalised solid and liquid waste was 3.41 kilotonnes/\u00a3m, a 13% reduction since 2014. The total amount of solid and liquid waste generated in operations was 46.1 kilotonnes, compared to 43.0 in 2021. This includes 16.5 kilotonnes of hazardous, primarily chemical, waste. The overall increase in the volume of waste produced has been driven  in  part  by  increased  production activities following the impact of COVID-19.\n\n## Target:\n\nIncrease the recycling and recovery rate to 68% by 2025 1,2,3\n\nOur recycling and recovery rate for 2022 was 61.4%. This represents a 1.3% reduction against the baseline, driven by an increased focus on managing materials consumption efficiency across our production facilities. Our Power Systems business now has a recycling and recovery rate above 80%. During the year, 4.1 kilotonnes of waste were sent to landfill, a 20% reduction since 2014. We continue to work to identify appropriate alternatives to landfill disposal for complex waste streams, such as foundry sand.\n\n2\n\nData has been calculated in accordance with our basis of reporting. This and further data is available at www.rolls-royce.com\n\n- 3 ITP Aero is classified as a discontinued business and Bergen Engines and Civil Nuclear were sold in 2021 and are, therefore, excluded from the scope of our targets. Historical data has been restated to reflect this\n- 4 Energy and waste data are normalised by Group revenue (\u00a3m)\n\nThese Group targets are supported by individual business-level targets as well as specific local targets to respond to particular risks or opportunities. For example, we monitor water consumption and exposure to areas of water-stress and/or high water usage. During 2022, we have continued to progress against these environmental targets, with good performance against our waste reduction and energy reduction targets in particular.\n\nWe recognise that it is often those closest to a challenge who can come up with the best solution. We have engaged our people in supporting our environmental targets, generating the small ideas that can make a big difference. In our Civil Aerospace business, for example, a big ideas event was held to help identify and scale employee-led proposals that will help deliver our targets. In total, the campaign generated over 100 submissions that ranged from parts recycling and better waste segregation, to renewable energy installations.\n\nDuring 2022, we introduced sustainability due diligence, including environmental performance assessments, for our tier 1 supply chain. This will help us to understand better the environmental impacts of our suppliers and identify areas we can work together to reduce environmental impacts, build operational resilience and improve performance. These assessments will also provide greater visibility of scope 3, category 1 purchased goods and services emissions and broader climate impacts on our supply chain.\n\nIn addition, during the year we began work to understand better our impacts on biodiversity and nature, driven by emerging policy; this will continue in 2023.",

Our people worked with great dedication and adapted to this rapidly changing environment. We sought ways to support and empower our people through this uncertainty, to enable them to be at their best. We did this by prioritising the following areas:\n\n- -safety, health and wellbeing of our people;\n- -creating an environment of inclusion and belonging;\n- -promoting a learning environment by continuing to directly engage our colleagues with digital content and enhanced learning tools;\n- -leadership capability;\n- -listening and engagement - hear what we do well and what areas we need to focus on, and do better; and\n- -community investment and focus on STEM.\n\nWe continued to invest in the infrastructure, tools and systems required to enhance our performance and ways of working. New digital technologies and platforms strengthened our approach to ongoing learning, and skills development. Our investment also enabled us to enhance our leadership capabilities through rolling out our refreshed leadership learning programmes.\n\n## Safety, health and wellbeing\n\nA healthy and safe working environment is fundamental to our success as a Group. We work to identify and control preventable incidents and we believe that motivating our colleagues to lead healthy lifestyles and maintain good wellbeing, including mental health, enables them to thrive.\n\nOur industry leading LiveWell programme supports the delivery of our wellbeing strategy, empowering and enabling our colleagues to take personal responsibility for their health and wellbeing. We believe in creating a working environment where our colleagues can be at their best and we provide resources to support healthy bodies, minds and workplaces.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| d f e                                    | a.

We further developed our global mental health champions, volunteers trained to guide colleagues and provide support on mental health. We also continued our work on menopause, providing support and information to reduce the stigma associated with reproductive health at work. We signed the wellbeing of women Menopause Workplace Pledge, committing to talk openly, positively and respectfully about the menopause.\n\nOur work on wellbeing enabled us to support the development of the Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) Work Health Index (WHI). The WHI enables businesses to benchmark their workplace approach to health and wellbeing against peers. In 2022, our LiveWell programme featured as a case study within the CBI WHI.\n\nProactive safety behaviour is the foundation of our safety culture and journey to zero harm. In 2021, we introduced a safety index which consists of a composite score of five leading indicators. The indicators measure five key areas: senior leadership safety walks; safety case improvement activity; HSE alert response; close-out of HSE non-conformances; and accountable person engagement. These measurements drive proactive safety behaviour and action, as well as more traditional measures such as injury rates.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved our target safety index score of 85%, representing a 15% improvement compared to 2021. The most significant improvement was in the number of safety leadership walks, which increased from 53% in 2021 to 83% in 2022. Visible, engaged leadership is integral to our journey to zero harm strategy and this will continue to be an area of focus in 2023. Our total reportable",

There were no fatalities.\n\n## TRI RATE (PER 100 EMPLOYEES) *\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2025 TARGET   |   0.33 |\n|---------------|--------|\n| 2022          |   0.41 |\n| 2021          |   0.43 |\n| 2020 BASELINE |   0.35 |\n\n- *  Our TRI rate shows the Group TRI performance (absolute and rate). External assurance over the TRI data is provided by Bureau Veritas (see page 199)\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace makes us a stronger company, enables us to hire the best talent, create high performing teams where our colleagues can reach their full potential and be at their best. In 2022, we focused on inclusion and belonging though our 'Being' campaign, where colleagues volunteered to participate in 'people like me' stories, celebrating them as a person and what makes them unique (see page 52).\n\nWe accelerated our efforts to attract and retain diverse talent and we embedded new inclusive hiring processes. We delivered our goals through four key pillars: lead, attract, retain, develop.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our focus on increasing the diversity of our external hires, 22% of all global hires were female compared with 19% in 2020. Additionally, 17% of hires in the UK and 26% of hires in the US were of ethnic minority backgrounds. We were recognised externally, winning a variety of awards, including first place in the Times Top 100 Engineering Graduate Employers, Best Engineering Employer for both males and females in the Universum Rankings and Best Diversity Initiative in the Engineering Talent Awards.\n\nTo support the growth and development of our under-represented populations, we introduced two new learning programmes: Connect & Belong, aimed at ethnically diverse talent; and Thrive, aimed at gender minorities. Both feature internal mentoring and skill development workshops. Forty-eight participants took part in Connect & Belong and 91 participated in our Thrive programme.\n\nWe give full and fair consideration to all employment applications from people with disabilities. If an employee becomes disabled whilst working for us we take steps to support their continued working including, wherever possible, making adjustments to ways of working.\n\nWhile we have work to do to meet our stretching 2025 diversity targets (see page 40), we continue to refresh our approach against our diversity and inclusion pillars, to expand the global reach and i mpact of programmes, while driving accountability through continued measurement.\n\n## Inspiring future talent\n\nWe refreshed our approach to early careers attraction this year through embedding inclusive hiring. We also focused on employee advocacy as a powerful tool to reach diverse talent pools. Our approach has centred on creating an authentic narrative, provided through people's stories, utilising social media and digital platforms. Partnerships became a key lever for attracting diverse talent into our internship and graduate roles. We sponsored three\n\n## Our inclusion goals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nundergraduate of the year awards and converted 89% of the finalists into internship offers across our female, social mobility and neurodiversity categories (76% female, 42% ethnicity). We have also grown our i-Accelerator insights programme to support 80 ethnically diverse students across both STEM and business programmes. Through holistically redesigning our end to end early careers approach, enhancing digital engagement and refreshing our assessment methods to focus on values and behaviours the diversity of our intake significantly increased. Our female graduate hires increased globally from 19% in 2021 to 40% in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, a new nuclear skills academy was opened in the UK to 200 apprentices as part of our strategy to inspire the next generation of future engineers. Creating and maintaining this pipeline of talent is crucial for industry growth in UK Defence, alongside providing jobs and opportunities for individuals across the UK. Working in partnership with the National Skills Academy for Nuclear (NSAN), Rolls-Royce SMR also developed a nuclear skills programme for colleagues who are new to nuclear within the nuclear industry framework.\n\n## Enabling and inspiring our people\n\nWe promote a learning environment by continuing to directly engage our colleagues with digital content and enhanced learning tools. These tools enable and empower our people to take ownership of their own learning and development, to support personal growth and high performance.\n\nIn 2022, our investment in learning and development was \u00a317.8m (2021: \u00a313.3m), delivering 581,505 hours of formal learning (2021: just over 250,000 hours). This reflects our transition to a new learning culture focused on providing on-demand learning and resources which are fully integrated into the flow of work. Leatro, our digital learning tool, facilitates learning in a style and pace to suit our colleagues learning requirements. Leatro Collections was introduced in 2022 and provides specially curated content for Rolls-Royce, focusing on commercial and technical areas, including digital and electrical skills, as well as enterprise topics such as: sustainability and climate; safety, health and wellbeing; leadership and engagement; and inclusion and diversity. LinkedIn Learning was also launched in 2022, adding over 16,000 new learning resources to our learning portfolio. Our continued focus on Leatro reflects our transition to a new learning culture that is focused on providing",

Of those employees in scope, 94.3% completed the training (2021: 97%) by the year-end deadline, with 99.5% of managers certifying their commitment to adhere to the principles set out in Our Code (2021: 99%) *.\n\n## Developing our potential using skills and gigs\n\nIn 2022, we have introduced an entirely new approach to l earning and skills development called gigs. It uses digital systems and artificial intelligence to create an internal marketplace of bite-sized tasks that support colleagues to drive their own career development.\n\nOur launch featured a pilot for around 500 engineers, a critical area where there is a need for skills to continually develop and grow due to changing technologies and customer requirements. Due to the success experienced by the initial participants around 8,500 people had signed up by year end.\n\nIt is driving growth in discretionary effort of people seeking new opportunities to learn and reskill for future technologies such as electrical flight and 6,000 hours of gigs in total have been completed so far. In addition gigs are also helping to drive progression of diverse colleagues. Of people doing a gig, 23% are female and 30% are from an ethnically diverse background. Our journey has received significant external recognition through awards such as a gold medal at the Brandon Hall International awards and winners of the talent management category at the 2022 Personnel Today awards.\n\n## Leadership capability\n\nWe continued our investment in leadership capability through the roll out of two creative and interactive blended learning programmes, providing critical leadership skills for first and second-line leaders. We also revolutionised our global learning experience by providing highly interactive and experiential programmes that bring subjectmatter to life. This includes pre and post-course coaching/mentoring and 24/7 access through mobile devices. These programmes have been recognised externally, achieving a bronze Brandon Hall Award for the Best Unique or Innovative Leadership Programme.\n\nAlongside our formal leadership development programmes, our digital leadership toolkit has been refreshed and updated to enable unlimited access for our leaders. In 2022, utilisation was just over 138,500 learning engagements and total utilisation since its launch in 2020 has reached 323,650.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nWe believe  that  highly  engaged  colleagues  fuel  business performance and that engagement is driven by leadership, a clear purpose and an environment where everyone can be at their best. Engagement is a key measure in our annual leadership incentive plans (see page 17). Furthermore we believe that listening to our colleagues provides opportunities to hear about what we do well and what areas we need to focus on and do better.\n\nGallup became our employee engagement partner in 2019 and we outlined our ambition to achieve a grand mean (overall average) score of 3.97 by the end of 2023. Our 2022 results keep us on track to achieve this ambition as we achieved a 75% participation rate and a grand mean score of 3.85. This meaningful increase of +0.12 since 2021 represents our third consecutive year of sustained improvement (+0.32 since 2019).\n\nWe provide a variety  of  channels  for  communication  and engagement including interactive learning sessions, newsletters and team briefings, as well as digital communication channels such as Yammer. We work closely with colleagues, elected employee representatives and with our employee resource groups (ERGs) to ensure we remain connected with our people. The ERGs are groups of colleagues organised primarily around a specific characteristic or life experience who provide personal and professional support to each other and run events for all to raise awareness of key issues and to help everyone to focus on inclusion.\n\nIn 2022, we held multiple leader led sessions with our employees. Topics included our financial results, incentives, pay, wellbeing and inclusion. Our Executive Team also held regular virtual conversations (Teams Talks) where colleagues globally participated in a live Q&A. We also held an in-person Meet the Board event where colleagues participated in a ballot to attend and they engaged in small group discussions with our Board members (see page 51).\n\n## Community and STEM outreach\n\nWe believe that we have a responsibility to invest in and engage communities, to inspire the next generation, enable opportunities for our people and reflect the diversity of the communities that we operate in, by building a pipeline of future talent.\n\nWe work with local partners to identify issues, define objectives and evaluate impacts within a global framework. Together, we develop activities to meet local needs and particularly focus on groups that are disadvantaged by social and economic factors.\n\nI n 2022, global community contributions totalled \u00a35.1m (2021: \u00a32.73m), with \u00a32.99m in cash donations, which included our response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Funds received as a result of a share forfeiture programme were not spent during 2022 but will be allocated in the future.\n\nTogether with our people, we contributed at least \u00a31m to help the people of Ukraine. Contributions included a global matched giving scheme in partnership with Habitat for Humanity. We also matched employee time contributions with our Works Council and made cash and in-kind donations to local agencies supporting refugees arriving i n Germany. Our Power Systems business donated gensets to maintain power to hospitals in Ukraine.\n\nOur people remain at the heart of all our programmes and contributed 48,347 hours (2021: 26,427) to community programmes. In 2022, at least 80 teams across the Group completed practical projects in their local communities ranging from improving facilities to maintaining natural environments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur non-financial KPIs are on page 17.

        "page_content": "The majority of our investment underpins our top priority to support good quality education for all (UNSDG 4). We reached 0.9 million people through our STEM programmes in 2022 and are now 37% towards our target to inspire 25 million of tomorrow's pioneers by 2030. Again, our people power this commitment, inspiring future generations as role models and educators.\n\n## Inspiring future generations with STEM\n\nEmerging technologies are at the heart of our STEM outreach activities. At the Big Bang Fair, the UK's largest STEM education event for young people, we connected with over 28,500 individuals in 2022.\n\n## Addressing inequalities in STEM\n\nOur programmes aim to remove barriers and enable success for people facing social and economic challenges. Our Unnati programmes (taken from the Hindi word meaning development) in India, help girls and young women studying STEM through school and university by providing targeted support to sustain learning through socioeconomic challenges (see page 55).\n\n## High quality teaching in STEM\n\nIn the UK, we are nurturing inspiring teachers in partnership with STEM Learning. We provided bursaries to support continuous professional development for 662 STEM teachers in 2022 and invited more than 60,000 teachers to enter the Rolls-Royce Schools Prize for Science and Technology through Project Enthuse.\n\n## Ways of working and supporting our colleagues\n\nWe believe the future of work is all about balance. In 2022, we continued to support flexible ways of working and we looked at ways to enable better collaboration, innovation and performance. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our approach and support leaders and teams to work together, to reimagine how we use our physical and digital workspaces in the future, to create a working environment where everyone can be at their best.\n\nWe have continued  to  make  changes  to  our  total  reward arrangements this year to manage costs and to remove inequalities between employee groups. We took steps to simplify and de-risk the Group's pension arrangements, ensuring that our people have access to good quality retirement plans but with less risk and leverage on our balance sheet. This included:\n\n- -the termination and full risk transfer of our main US defined benefit pension plan;\n- -securing agreement to termination of future accrual to our Canadian defined pension plans; and\n- -securing agreement with our largest German employee group to transition future build up of retirement benefits onto a defined contribution basis.\n\nWe conducted and concluded pay reviews and negotiations with our employees and their representatives (where relevant). We focused on making sure that our pay and benefit arrangements are competitively positioned and sustainable for the future.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of economic and geopolitical uncertainty, our pay negotiations for several of our bargaining groups were protracted and at times difficult. UK pay agreements were reached with our various bargaining groups, to provide increases of 6.5% in 2022, plus a one-off payment of \u00a31,500, to help towards the cost of living, for most of our employees.\n\nWe entered a new multi-year deal in Canada with our largest employee groups that will provide certainty of salaries until 2028. Our largest collectively bargained groups in the US are still within a multi-year deal that will run until 2025.\n\nOur German colleagues are covered by the Metal Tariff arrangements which were reviewed during the year and will provide increases of 5.2% in 2023, followed by 3.3% in 2024, together with one-off payments totalling \u20ac3,000 following a three-year freeze on tariff rates. We also make our incentive schemes and share programmes widely available to all colleagues to enhance connection and share in business successes.\n\nDuring 2022, we experienced industrial action within our Civil Aerospace business in Canada. The matter was resolved with agreements supported by the local workforce. Overall, our approach and ways of working with our employee and trade union representatives has remained collaborative and we will continue to work closely with all colleagues and employee representatives to deliver the productivity and efficiency improvements which are vital for the future competitiveness of our workforce.\n\n## Our diversity metrics at 31 December 2022 \u00b9\n\n## Female diversity percentage tracking and 2025 targets\n\n|                  | 2021   | 2022   | 2025 Target   |\n|------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| The Board        | 38%    | 33%    | 40%           |\n| Executive Team   | 9%     | 18%    | 33%           |\n| ELG              | 21%    | 22%    | 35%           |\n| Senior leaders \u00b2 | 20%    | 22%    | 30%           |\n| All employees    | 17%    | 18%    | 25%           |\n\n## Ethnic diversity percentage tracking and 2025 targets for UK and US \u00b3\n\n|              | 2021   | 2022   | 2025  Target   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|----------------|\n| UK ethnicity | 10%    | 11%    | 14%            |\n| US ethnicity | 15%    | 16%    | 20%            |\n\n## Gender diversity\n\n|                                                   | Female   | Male   | Total   | Female %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|\n| The Board                                         | 4        | 8      | 12      | 33%        |\n| Executive Team (ET)                               | 2        | 9      | 11      | 18%        |\n| ET, Chief Governance  Officer and direct  reports | 19       | 67     | 86      | 22%        |\n| Senior leaders \u00b2                                  | 20       | 70     | 90      | 22%        |\n| All employees                                     | 7,575    | 34,300 | 41,875  | 18%        |\n\n- \u00b9 The data for diversity information is showing permanent employee year-end actuals\n- \u00b2  Senior leaders are defined in the Companies Act 2006 (those who have responsibility for planning and directing or controlling the activities of the entity or a strategically significant part of it).

Our code of conduct (Our Code) and associated Group policies form a key part of the Rolls-Royce framework. Together they guide our business decision making to ensure we can be proud of the way we behave and the way we do business.\n\nOur Global Supplier Code of Conduct sets out our minimum ethical expectations on our suppliers. In 2022, this was updated to enhance alignment to the principles in Our Code. All suppliers are contractually required to adhere to this or a mutually agreed alternative.\n\nWe actively encourage people to speak up in the event of a question or concern and provide a number of channels to our employees and our stakeholders to enable them to do so, including the Rolls-Royce speak up line. We issue a report to everyone at regular intervals to highlight key statistics and remind them of the importance to speak up. In 2022, the mandatory diversity and inclusion training included a specific section on the importance of speaking up and a reminder of the different speak up channels available to employees.\n\nWe have a zero tolerance approach to misconduct of any kind and will take disciplinary action, where appropriate, up to and including dismissal in the event of a breach of Our Code. In 2022, 76 employees (2021: 45) left the business for reasons related to breaches of Our Code. The increase in cases is principally due to improved consistency and accuracy on classification of dismissals.\n\nOur Code and associated anti-bribery and corruption policy clearly set out our commitment to zero tolerance of bribery and corruption i n any form. In 2022, we embedded our Group policies into our digital Code to improve accessibility for our employees. We have continued to make improvements on our bribery and corruption risk assessment and controls, following recommendations made by an independent review of our ethics and compliance programme undertaken in 2021. We also continued to improve our compliance programme in Brazil which involved co-operating with the Controller General, Brazil under the terms of a two-year leniency agreement signed in October 2021 relating to historical bribery issues.\n\n## Human rights and anti-slavery\n\nAs set out in our human rights policy, we are committed to protecting and preserving the internationally recognised human rights of those that may be impacted by our business activities along our value chain.\n\nWe operate in accordance with human rights requirements through strict compliance with strategic export laws and sanctions regulations in the countries where we operate. Our due diligence activities are embedded within our ethics, people, export control and procurement programmes. Human rights risks in our value chain are identified and assessed through a range of channels including our speak up line, country and sector risk analysis, screening platforms and self-assessment questionnaires. Potential or actual human rights impacts are addressed using tailored corrective action plans and a series of preventative measures. These activities are overseen by the human rights steering group and the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee (see page 96).\n\nIn 2022, we established a human rights development programme to strengthen our due diligence activities in the value chain. This included updating our human rights policy and working with an external specialist to complete a human rights saliency assessment drawing from international standards, stakeholder consultations, and country and sector risk indices. Using an external platform, we evaluated our human rights and sustainability performance and  continue  to  improve  our  programme  based  on  those recommendations. Specific human rights leaders were appointed at Group and business level to drive implementation of the programme. Furthermore, we continue to enhance our sustainability assessments with our supply chain partners and have set appropriate KPIs to monitor effectiveness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind more information on our anti-slavery and human trafficking statement; Group policies and materials stewardship page at www.rolls-royce.com\n\nFor more information on our ethics approach see the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee report on page 96 or view 'Sustaining our culture of Integrity' document available at www.rolls-royce.com",

        "page_content": "## PRINCIPAL RISKS\n\n## Our risk and internal control system\n\nThe Board has established procedures to manage risk and oversee the risk management system (RMS). The Board has also established procedures to determine the nature and extent of the principal and emerging risks the Group is willing to take in order to optimise its commercial opportunities and achieve its long-term strategic objectives.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the Group's internal financial controls which form a subset of the broader set of controls. Financial reporting controls are identified and subject to periodic review by the Group's internal control team. The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, performs an annual review of our RMS and its effectiveness (see page 75). During the year, the Board completed a robust assessment of both our principal and emerging risks. Details of how our principal risks have changed over the year are described below.\n\nOur RMS is designed to identify and manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## How we manage risk\n\nRisks are identified by individuals across all businesses and functions and at many layers of the organisation by considering what could stop us achieving our strategic, operational or compliance objectives or impact the sustainability of our business model.\n\nRisk owners assess the risks, likelihood and impact, taking into account current mitigating control activities, identifying where additional activities may be needed to bring the risk within our risk appetite.\n\nRisk owners consider the effectiveness of current mitigating control activities in their assessment, supported by different assurance providers including internal audit. These considerations are recorded using a variety of systems and tools depending on the risk area. In managing the identified risks, judgement is necessary to evaluate the risks facing the Group in achieving its objectives, determine the risks that are considered acceptable, determine the likelihood of those risks materialising, assess the Group's ability to reduce the impact of risks that do materialise and ensure the costs of operating particular controls are proportionate to the benefit provided.\n\nRisk owners bring the results of their assessment, current risk status and action plans to business, function and other management review forums as often as is required depending on the nature of the risk, for support, challenge and oversight. These forums include the monthly Executive Team and regular Board and Board committee meetings.\n\nAt least once a year the Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board conducts a review of the effectiveness of the RMS and where required identifies areas for improvement (more details of this review can be found on page 75). For key compliance and safety risks, the Group has a set of mandatory policies and training which set out the expectations on employees and the controls in place. Every employee is required, annually, to complete training and confirm that they will comply with the mandatory policies. The consequences of non-compliance are addressed via performance management systems that are linked to remuneration.\n\nDuring 2022, we have continued to focus on improving our internal control environment for financial and non-financial controls and worked to embed these controls into our business processes. We expect this work to continue in 2023. It will be complimented by work to prepare for the changes set out in the BEIS proposals on 'restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'.\n\n## Principal risks\n\nOur principal risks are identified and managed in the same way as other risks. Principal risks are owned by at least one member of the Executive Team and subject to a review at an Executive Team meeting at least once each year, before a review by the Board or a Board committee.\n\nWe have reviewed our principal risks over the course of the year and have updated them to reflect changes to the external environment and our existing plans. We will continue to monitor our principal risks in light of the strategic review.\n\n## Changes in our principal risk levels\n\nWe continue to review our principal risks and how we manage them to reflect their evolving nature. We have reviewed our risks in light of changes to the internal and external environment, in  particular  economic uncertainty, inflation, supply chain disruption and a tightening labour market; the current political situation including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent cost and availability of electricity and natural gas and continuing disruptions to global supply chains. Despite the rigorous supply chain management, leaner manufacturing, strategic partnerships, application of contractual pricing protection, utilisation of our hedge book and continued focus on pricing, productivity and costs we believe the risk levels for financial shock, market shock, business continuity and political risk have increased since last year.\n\n## Increased risks:\n\nFinancial shock\n\nThe rapidly changing external environment, in particular rising interest rates, inflation, energy costs and the changing value of sterling have heightened the risk of financial shocks to the Group. As planned, the proceeds of the ITP disposal being used towards repaying the \u00a32bn UKEF loan facility has in part helped to mitigate this risk, as all remaining debt is currently at fixed interest rates.\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments to hedge net foreign currency cash flows, which are mainly denominated in US dollar. In 2022, the Board agreed to update our hedging policy, reducing the hedging time horizon from ten to five years which will allow us to react quicker to changes in the external environment.\n\n## Market shock\n\nThe likelihood of one or more macroeconomic risk occurring has increased over the past 12 months, with economic growth reducing and energy costs, government borrowing and long-term interest rates increasing. The combined effect could be to reduce economic growth and disposable income which in turn could reduce capital investment and the propensity to travel. In addition, high level of debt by national governments, in particular the UK and US, could, in the long run, temper their spending on defence and funding research and technology.",

        "page_content": "## Business continuity\n\n## Other specific risks\n\nA combination of supply chain constraints, high inflation, slowing economic growth and the potential for energy shortages in Europe means the likelihood of supply shortages, or supplier failure, has increased over the year. We have responded by using rigorous supply chain management, leaner manufacturing, strategic partnerships, application of contractual pricing protection, increasing working capital and reviewing supplier health and where necessary offering support to key partners. For further information on supplier engagement, see our case study on page 50.\n\n## Political risk\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has resulted in heightened political risk to the Group. As outlined on page 13, we took the decision to stop doing business in Russia and to reduce the supply of titanium from Russia.\n\n## New and retired risks:\n\nIn light of our transformation programme outlined on page 8, we have replaced our previous strategic transformation risk with a revised risk relating to the execution of this programme.\n\nChange in risk level:\n\nIncreased\n\nStatic\n\nDecreased\n\nNew\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## HOW WE MANAGE PRINCIPAL RISKS\n\n| RISK                                                                                                                                                                                           | CONTROLS                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | ASSURANCE ACTIVITIES  AND PROVIDERS                            | OVERSIGHT FORUM                               | BUSINESS  MODEL   | CHANGE   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Safety                                                                                                                                                                                         | Product:                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Product:  -

The Directors consider this 18-month period to be appropriate as it includes the maturity of \u00a31bn of the Group's \u00a35.5bn undrawn borrowing facilities in January 2024 and the repayment at maturity of a \u20ac550m (\u00a3484m) bond in May 2024.\n\nThe plans approved by the Board are used as the basis for monitoring the Group's performance, incentivising employees and providing external guidance to shareholders.\n\nThe processes for identifying and managing risk are described on pages 42 to 47. As described on those pages, the risk management process and the going concern and viability statements are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance.\n\n## Forecasts\n\nRecognising the challenges of reliably estimating and forecasting the impact of external factors on the Group, the Directors have considered two forecasts in the assessment of going concern, along with a likelihood assessment of these forecasts. The base case forecast reflects the Directors current expectations of future trading. A stressed downside forecast has also been modelled, which envisages a 'stressed' or 'downside' situation that is considered severe but plausible.\n\nThe Group's base case forecast reflects a steady and ongoing recovery of trading towards pre-pandemic levels, especially in the civil aviation industry. Macro-economic assumptions have been modelled using externally available data based on the most likely forecasts, with i nflation at 3%-4%, interest rates at 4%-6% and GDP growth at around 2%. In the base case forecast, Civil Aerospace large engine EFHs are expected to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024.\n\nThe stressed downside forecast assumes no further recovery in Civil Aerospace large engines, with EFHs modelled at the average fourth quarter 2022 levels throughout the 18-month period to August 2024, reflecting slower GDP growth in this forecast when compared with the base case. It also assumes a more pessimistic view of inflation at around 6% higher than the base case covering a broad range of costs including energy, commodities and jet fuel. Interest rates in the stressed downside are 1%-2% higher than the base case. The stressed downside also considers lower demand and load reduction through our factories,  and  possible  ongoing  supply  chain challenges.\n\nThe future impact of climate change on the Group has been considered through climate scenarios. Key variables include carbon prices based on the IEA Net Zero scenario, which assumes an increase from $46 per tonne of carbon in 2022 to $250 per tonne in 2050, commodity price trends temperature rises and GDP information derived from the Oxford Economics Global Climate Service Net Zero scenario aligned to IPCC SSPI-19. The climate scenarios modelled do not have a material impact on either the base case or downside forecast over the 18-month period to August 2024.\n\nThe proceeds from the disposal of ITP Aero, which completed on 15 September 2022, were used towards the repayment of a drawn \u00a32bn UKEF loan which was due to mature in August 2025. A new \u00a31bn UKEF facility was entered into in September 2022, which remains undrawn.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Group had liquidity of \u00a38.1bn including cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32.6bn and undrawn facilities of \u00a35.5bn.\n\nThe Group's committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2022 and 31 August 2024 are set out below. None of the facilities are subject to any financial covenants or rating triggers which could accelerate repayment.\n\n| (\u00a3m)                                   | 31 December  2022   | 31 August  2024   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Issued Bond Notes  1                   | 3,995               | 3,511             |\n| UKEF \u00a31bn loan (undrawn)  2            | 1,000               | 1,000             |\n| UKEF \u00a31bn loan (undrawn)  3            | 1,000               | 1,000             |\n| Revolving Credit Facility (undrawn)  4 | 2,500               | 2,500             |\n| Bank Loan Facility (undrawn)  5        | 1,000               | -                 |\n| Total committed borrowing facilities   | 9,495               | 8,011             |\n\n- 2 The \u00a31,000m UKEF loan matures in March 2026 (currently undrawn)\n- 3 The \u00a31,000m UKEF loan matures in September 2027 (currently undrawn)\n- 4 The \u00a32,500m revolving credit facility matures in April 2025 (currently undrawn)\n- 5 The \u00a31,000m bank loan facility matures in January 2024 (currently undrawn)\n\nTaking into account the maturity of these borrowing facilities, the Group has committed facilities of at least \u00a38.0bn available throughout the period to 31 August 2024.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter reviewing the current liquidity position and the cash flow forecasts modelled under both the base case and stressed downside, the Directors consider that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 18 months from the date of this report and are therefore satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the consolidated and Company financial statements.",

Our downside forecast uses the same assumptions as the going concern assessment for the first 18 months and in 2025 to 2027 assumes a slower recovery than assumed in our base case.\n\nConsistent with previous years, we have assessed our viability over a five-year period which is in line with our five-year planning process. We continue to believe that this is the most appropriate time period to consider as, inevitably, the degree of certainty reduces over any longer period.\n\nWe have created severe but plausible scenarios that estimate the potential impact of our principal risks arising over the assessment period (descriptions of our principal risks and the controls in place to mitigate them can be found on pages 43 to 47). The risks chosen and scenarios used are as shown in the table below.\n\nThe cash flow impacts of these scenarios were overlaid on the fiveyear forecast to assess how the Group's liquidity would be affected.\n\nThe scenarios assume an appropriate management response to the specific event which could be undertaken and also consider specific activities to improve liquidity such as raising additional funds, reducing expenditure and divesting parts of our business.\n\nReverse stress testing has also been performed to assess the severity of scenarios that would have to occur to exceed liquidity headroom. The assumptions used in these stress tests were not considered plausible, as shown in the table below.\n\nOn the basis described above, the Board confirms that it has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next five years. In making this statement, the Directors have made the following key assumptions:\n\n- \u00b7 \u00a31,000m bank loan facility maturing in 2024 *\n- \u00b7 \u20ac550m bond maturing in 2024\n- \u00b7 \u00a32,500m revolving credit facility maturing in 2025 *\n- \u00b7 $1,000m bond maturing in 2025\n- \u00b7 \u00a31,000m UKEF loan maturing in 2026 *\n- \u00b7 \u00a31,000m UKEF loan maturing in 2027 *\n- \u00b7 \u20ac750m bond maturing in 2026\n- \u00b7 \u00a3375m bond maturing in 2026\n- \u00b7 $1bn bond maturing in 2027\n- \u00b7 \u00a3545m bond maturing in 2027;\n- * Currently undrawn facilities\n- -the Group has access to global debt markets and expects to be able to refinance these debt facilities on commercially acceptable terms;\n- -that implausible scenarios do not occur. Implausible scenarios include either multiple risks impacting at the same time or where management actions do not mitigate an individual risk to the degree assumed; and\n- -that in the event of one or more risks occurring (which has a particularly severe effect on the Group) all potential actions (such as but not limited to restricting capital and other expenditure to only committed and essential levels, reducing or eliminating discretionary spend, reinstating pay deferrals, raising additional funds through debt or equity raises, executing disposals and undertaking further restructuring) would be taken on a timely basis.\n\nThe Group believes it has the early warning mechanisms to identify the need for such actions and, as demonstrated by our decisive actions over the course of the pandemic, has the ability to implement them on a timely basis if necessary.\n\n- -the Group is able to refinance maturing debt facilities and drawdown existing available facilities as required. Debt maturities over the assessment period are as follows:\n\n| PRINCIPAL RISK                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS AND IMPACTS                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Civil  Aerospace  product  safety  event  resulting  in  aircraft  being  grounded,  lower  engine  flying  hour  revenues,  commercial penalties and additional costs (e.g. unplanned shop visits).

Our section 172 (s172) statement below sets out how the Directors have discharged their s172 duty. The Board recognises the responsibility to all our different but interrelated stakeholder groups and wider society. We recognise that effective engagement with a broad range of our stakeholders is essential for\n\nthe long-term success of the business and we aim to create value for our stakeholders every day by maintaining levels of business conduct that are aligned to our values and our purpose. This section should be read in conjunction with the Board's focus which contains information on the principal decisions made by the Board over the year, see pages 67 and 68.\n\nThe likely consequences of any decision in the long term\n\n## The interests of the Company's employees\n\nDuring the year, the Directors considered the Group's strategic direction.  This,  in  turn,  creates  long-term  value  for shareholders, recognising that the longer- term success of our business depends on the effects of our business activities on wider society. In a year marked by external shocks, both geopolitical and macro-economic, the Board discussions focused on the labour environment, implications of supply chain disruption and the impact of the swift withdrawal from Russia, including the longer-term reliance on Russia for key materials such as titanium.\n\nThe Directors recognise that the success of our business depends on attracting, retaining and motivating talented people. The Directors consider and assess the implications of decisions on our people, where relevant and feasible. The swift withdrawal from Russia resulted in employees being relocated and the Board spoke with impacted colleagues during a site visit to Friedrichshafen, Germany. The Directors seek to ensure that the Company remains a responsible employer, including with respect to pay and benefits, health and  safety  issues,  the  workplace  environment  and engagement with the unions. A case study on our 'Being' campaign can be found on page 52.\n\n## The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others\n\n## The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment\n\nDelivering our strategy requires a strong, mutual and beneficial  relationship  with  suppliers,  customers, governments and joint venture partners. The Directors receive updates on engagement across the Group at Board meetings. A case study on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on procurement can be found on page 53.\n\n## The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct\n\nThe Board reviews and approves our ethics and compliance frameworks. We updated our human rights policy during 2022. This, in conjunction with the Board monitoring compliance with governance standards, helps to ensure that Board-level decisions and the actions of our subsidiaries promote high standards of business conduct. Our Code of Conduct, supplier code and modern slavery statements ensure high standards are approved and can be found on www.rolls-royce.com.\n\nThe Board receives information through reports from the Chief Executive and Group-level reviews on various topics to help the Directors make decisions relating to net zero ambitions and proposals to divest or invest. In addition, initiatives taken during the year, including one-off payments to employees in light of the economic climate, are set out on page 40. A case study on the Unnati STEM programmes in India can be found on page 55.\n\nThe need to act fairly between members of the Company\n\nAfter weighing up all relevant factors, the Directors consider which course of action best enables delivery of our strategy through the long term, taking into consideration the effect on the Group's stakeholders.",

The Employee Champions provide regular feedback to the Board on topics of interest and/or concern. This provides a valuable link between our people and the Directors. We believe that these methods of engagement with our people are effective in building and maintaining trust and communication, whilst providing our people with a forum to influence change in relation to matters that affect them.\n\nThe Meet the Board event during 2022, enabled around 100 colleagues to ask the Board questions relating to their personal experiences, work life balance and other cultural topics, including imposter syndrome. Feedback from both colleagues and the Board was overwhelmingly positive.\n\nThe Employee Champions continue to meet regularly with the employee stakeholder engagement committee, which provides support for their focus on employee engagement. The Employee Champions also met with many of the employee resource groups (ERG) during the year. At the Asia-Pacific ERG there was active discussion on LGBTQ+, as well as debates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board recognises that the quality of the Group's customer relationships  is  based  on  mutual  trust  as  well  as  our engineering expertise. We recognise that we must retain and strengthen our focus on the transition to a net zero carbon global economy by creating the sustainable power that our customers require. We continue to focus on helping our customers deliver their own sustainability agendas, making products more sustainable, maintaining peace and providing protection for society.\n\non whether some cultures were not as open to everyone's differences. Culture was also a key theme at the North American ERG, with discussion on the importance of authentic and i nclusive leaders. Feedback from the ERG sessions contributed to positive action being taken, including a dotted-line reporting route for ERGs into the global head of inclusion demonstrating leadership support. In addition, during 2022 there were several in-person and virtual site events, including a site visit to Friedrichshafen, Germany, in September. In addition, Wendy visited Indianapolis, US, to discuss diversity & inclusion with a focus on hybrid working with positive feedback shared on the Group's approach to flexible working. Wendy also visited Washington, UK, where employees discussed innovation and the automation of shop floor processes.\n\nIn addition, the Board engaged with CCLA Investment Management on cost of living and mental health. During the year, the Board received updates on ongoing matters with the unions across our operations, together with related strike action in Canada, see page 40. These updates influenced Board discussion and debate. Given the current economic situation with social pressures and cost of living, it was agreed that a one-off payment would be made to employees in some of our larger locations (see page 40).\n\nMany of our people are also our shareholders and we encourage their participation in a variety of share plans.\n\n## Board engagement\n\nThe Board regularly receives operational updates, including customer metrics and feedback, from each of the businesses. During 2022, the Business Presidents presented their updates to the Board. This greatly influences the Board's deliberations and its support for the Executive Team when considering our strategy.\n\nThe Chair continued to meet with key customers during the year.",

The Board continued to receive updates from the businesses on supplier performance and supply chain disruption. The Board received an update on the first in-person global supplier conference since the pandemic.\n\n## Case study\n\n## Impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on procurement\n\nMost components which go into an engine are bought from our suppliers. Power Systems has established a worldwide supply chain with 130 main suppliers (direct material) with a spend of approximately \u20ac1.4bn during 2022 (equalling 80% of the total direct material spend). This spend is managed by an international team of procurement and supply chain experts, located globally.\n\n## Strong risk management system\n\n- -Due to rising tensions prior to the conflict starting in 2022, Power Systems' risk management indicated a high risk from Ukraine suppliers and built up second sources for Ukraine-based suppliers\n- -After qualification of the parts, procurement could guarantee  the  supply  of  parts  through  several independent sources, enabling Power Systems to run the assembly without any interruption during the conflict\n\n## Supplier events\n\n- -Power Systems hosted two supplier expos during 2022, built around critical importance across the supply chain, possible gas and power shortages, the drive for zero defects and CO2 reduction. Special focus was given to military rising demands and to securing the supply chain\n- -At the beginning of 2022, Power Systems held an event to recognise their best suppliers\n\n## Board engagement\n\n- -During March, the Board discussed the direct and i ndirect impact on the supply chain taking into account the situation in Russia and cost inflation pressure on margins\n- -During May, the Board discussed scenario planning around targeted sanctions and the proposed impact on non-sanctioned Power Systems customers\n- -In September, the Board received an update on the strong order position with customers making advance deposit payments to secure orders\n\n## Collaboration\n\n- -To protect the supply chain from unforeseen difficulties, Power Systems require the supply chain to reduce gas dependencies and therefore require regular progress reports to get an overview of existing risk\n- -A total of 146 European suppliers were contacted regarding potential energy and gas shortages.

Working with expert partners, we have identified social and economic barriers that prevent girls and women participating in STEM careers. We have developed a programme to address these barriers.\n\n## Developing Unnati Wings4Her\n\n- -I dentified key societal issues with Charities Aid Foundation, I ndia within the context of the STEM KPI which is to inspire 25 million of tomorrow's pioneers by 2030\n- -Developed and funded pilot Wings4Her programme with four schools in Delhi during 2021 and 2022\n- -Group charitable contributions and social sponsorships committee monitored progress\n\n## Social and economic factors\n\n- -Unnati Wings4Her was designed to bridge the gap in STEM education to empower girls facing social and economic challenges\n- -Lack of study support to help girls through the tough level of high-school studies discourages many from continuing with STEM subjects\n- -Pilot programme evaluated in partnership with Charities Aid Foundation, India\n- -Wings4Her impact assessed against charitable contributions and social sponsorships policy and criteria\n- -Approved proposal to extend Wings4Her programme to Bangalore in 2023\n- -Included in the annual review of community engagement by the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee\n- -Financially disadvantaged families discontinue girls' education or lack resources to prepare them for competitive exams for undergraduate STEM courses\n- -A lack of awareness of the variety of STEM careers drives the perception that these are unsuitable for girls\n- -Crucial support from families to pursue STEM career ambitions can be lacking\n\n## Interventions and success data\n\nWings4Her provides targeted support to make STEM studies more equitable. The pilot programme in four government schools in Delhi, working with 100 girls, resulted in 30% of the girls going on to study at under-graduate level, as well as scholarship support for 20 students to further their STEM studies. The programme included:\n\n- -career guidance to increase aspiration and enable informed choices;\n- -workshops for parents to create positive support for their daughters' career ambitions; and\n- -scholarships for under-graduate study to enable continuing education.\n\n## Board and committee engagement\n\n- -The Board received an update on progress of the STEM programme more generally\n- -The Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee received an update on the STEM programmes in India, including Wings4Her and scholarships\n- -The Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee discussed the Wings4Her programme in light of the theory of societal change and received updates from the team on how these programmes align with national and governmental initiatives in India\n\nStrategic Report signed on behalf of the Board\n\n## Pamela Coles\n\nChief Governance Officer\n\n23 February 2023",

We have progressed towards our target to reach gender parity on the Board with recently announced changes.\n\n## Leadership and succession planning\n\nThere were a number of changes on the Board this year. Warren East stepped down as Chief Executive on 31 December having served eight years on the Board and almost all as Chief Executive. Tufan Erginbilgic was appointed as Chief Executive on 1 January 2023 following an extensive global search conducted by external advisors. Tufan is a proven leader of winning teams within complex multinational organisations, with an ability to drive a high-performance culture and deliver results for investors. Further information on Tufan's extensive experience can be found in Tufan's biography on page 62. Information on his appointment process is set out in detail in the Nominations & Governance Report on page 72.\n\nIrene Dorner stepped down from the Board in May and Lee Hsien Yang stepped down from the Board in December having reached his nine-year term. Mike Manley will not be standing for re-election at the 2023 Annual General Meeting and will step down from the Board on 11 May 2023.\n\nLord Jitesh Gadhia joined the Board and became Chair of the Remuneration Committee from the conclusion of the 2022 Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2022. Birgit Behrendt will join the Board following the 2023 Annual General Meeting (see page 5).\n\nAs a result of these changes, the gender diversity of our Board will be more than 40% women which meets the target confirmed in our Board diversity policy. This is clear recognition of the importance we place as a Board on diversity\ufffd\n\nThere is a full discussion of these leadership changes and our Board diversity in the Nominations & Governance Report on page 70.\n\n## Effectiveness\n\nThe Board and Committee evaluation for 2022 showed that good progress had been made following the implementation of the outcomes from the 2021 evaluation. Further details on the effectiveness review are on page 69.\n\n## Culture\n\nThroughout my first full year as Chair I have endeavoured to promote continued Board engagement with our people. Following the 2022 Annual General Meeting we held an in-person Meet the Board event where around 100 employees from across Rolls-Royce were able to interact with Board members and share experiences, discuss concerns and swap insights. Topics discussed included work life balance, the personal experiences of our Board Directors and other cultural topics including imposter syndrome. The event was a great success and the level of engagement from both our employees and the Board was highly motivating.\n\nIn September, the Board visited Friedrichshafen, Germany. The visit included a site visit which allowed the Board to meet with employees and learn more about the operations of the site. Wendy Mars, one of our Non-Executive Directors and an Employee Champion, talks about the value of site visits in her interview on page 64. These site visits give us a valuable insight into the day-to-day business which helps shape discussions in the boardroom.\n\n## Governance\n\nDuring the year we continued with our Board Apprentice programme. The purpose of the programme is to provide coaching and board experience to a diverse group of emerging leaders selected from the Group's talent pool, whilst also demonstrating our commitment to participants' career progression and development as leaders.\n\nThe work of our Employee Champions continued this year. Wendy Mars assumed the role of Employee Champion alongside Bev Goulet and Lee Hsien Yang. Information on how they connected with our people during the year can be found in the Section 172(1) Statement on page 51\ufffd Wendy also discusses her role as Employee Champion in her induction interview on page 64.\n\nDuring the year, the Board and Audit Committee were kept appraised of the developments in relation to the BEIS consultation 'restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'. The BEIS response, which was published in May 2022, emphasised the importance of balancing much-needed reform with maintaining the UK as a key financial centre where businesses can grow. We continued to keep close to both BEIS and the FRC throughout 2022 as communications and related consultations and guidance were and continue to be published\ufffd\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nI  look forward to engaging with shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2023. Following the success of the hybrid meeting during the 2022 Annual General Meeting, we are similarly encouraging shareholders to join, participate and vote virtually. I look forward to seeing many of you and to answering any questions that you may have.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nOur priority is, of course, to build a strong rapport with Tufan and maintain open and transparent communications with him on Board expectations.\n\nWe will, as a Board, maintain focus on employee sentiment and culture during 2023, recognising the importance of the success of our transformation programme.\n\n## Dame Anita Frew\n\nChair",

It sets the Group's strategy and objectives and oversees and monitors internal controls, risk management, principal risks, governance and viability of the Company. In doing so, the Directors comply with their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (see pages 50 to 55).\n\nThe Board has established certain principal committees to assist it in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, providing dedicated focus on particular areas, as set out below. The chair of each committee reports to the Board on the committee's activities after each meeting.\n\nIn addition to the Board's principal committees, it has established a sub-committee of Directors who each hold an appropriate level of UK national security clearance for the purpose of receiving and considering, on behalf of the Board, any UK classified information relating to the Group's programmes and activities.\n\nBeverly Goulet, a US national and independent Non-Executive Director, also sits on the board of Rolls-Royce North America Holdings, Inc. to create a link between the Board and the Group's North American governance structure.\n\n## Roles and responsibilities\n\nThe roles of the Chair and Chief Executive are clearly defined and the Board supports the separation of the two roles. The Chair is responsible for the leadership and effectiveness of the Board. The Chief Executive is responsible for the running of the Group's business and leads the Executive Team which comes together to review, agree and communicate issues and actions of Group-wide significance.\n\nNon-Executive Directors support the Chair and provide objective and constructive challenge to management. The Senior Independent Director (SID) provides a sounding board for the Chair and serves as an intermediary for the Chief Executive, other Directors and shareholders when required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors' independence\n\nWe continue to monitor and note potential conflicts of interest that each Director may have and recommend to the Board whether these should be authorised and if any conditions should be attached to such authorisations. The Directors are regularly reminded of their continuing obligations in relation to conflicts and are required to review and confirm their external interests at least annually. This helps us to consider whether each of them continues to be independent.\n\nFollowing due consideration, the Board determined that all NonExecutive Directors continued to be independent in both character and judgement. Furthermore, it was determined that the Chair was independent on her appointment.\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer ensures that appropriate and timely information is provided to the Board and its committees and is responsible for advising and supporting the Chair and the Board on all governance matters. All Directors have access to the Chief Governance Officer and may take independent professional advice at the Company's expense in conducting their duties.\n\n## THE BOARD COMMITTEES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Board induction and development\n\nThe Chair and Chief Governance Officer arrange a comprehensive, tailored induction programme for newly-appointed Non-Executive Directors, which includes dedicated time with the Executive Team and senior management and scheduled trips to business operations. The programme is tailored based on experience and background of the individual and the requirements of the role. All Directors visit the Group's main operating sites as part of their induction and are encouraged to make at least one visit to other sites every year. Site visits are an important part of the induction process, as well as for continuing education. They help Directors understand the Group's activities through the direct experience of seeing our facilities and operations and by having discussions with a diverse group of our people\ufffd\n\nIt  is  important  that  the  Directors  continue  to  develop  and refresh their understanding of the Group's activities. The Board's engagement with its stakeholders is set out on pages 50 to 55. It is also important that the Directors regularly refresh and update their skills and knowledge and receive relevant training when necessary. During 2022, the Directors received tailored training on climate-related matters. In addition, several deep dives on specific topics are scheduled throughout the year, see page 66. Members of the Board also attend relevant seminars, conferences and training events to keep up-to-date on developments in key areas\ufffd\n\n## AN INTERVIEW WITH WENDY MARS\n\n## Non-Executive Director and Employee Champion, joined the Board in December 2021\n\n- Q During 2022, you were able to complete your induction programme. How was the programme for you as a Board member of Rolls-Royce and how did it support you to get up to speed with the business?\n- A My induction was really thorough and gave me a good understanding of the main areas of the business, providing me with a very solid foundation to build on, both as a Board member and as an Employee Champion\ufffd The programme itself introduced me to key areas of the business and I have been given the space and opportunity to go and explore these in greater detail.\n- Q What does it mean to you to be an Employee Champion?\n- A I really enjoy spending time with our people, to better understand the views of the workforce globally allowing me to better represent their voice in the boardroom. This is important, not just to me on a personal level, but to the Board, as it provides vital context and reality to discussions and allows me to shape conversations, influenced by the perspectives of the workforce.\n- Q I n September you visited Friedrichshafen in Germany. What is the importance of site visits to you personally?\n- A This visit left me feeling extremely proud of Rolls-Royce, having met with a range of great talent, including several apprentices. I found it very impressive to see how the apprentices, at such a young age, managed to become so embedded into the Company.\n- Site visits allow me to see what is really going on in the business and on the shop floor. As Directors, we have the opportunity to see the operational detail, adding a sense of reality to the information we receive in the boardroom. These visits allow us to make connections with our people which is crucial for me as an Employee Champion and I can then take these real-life conversations and reflect on these during board discussions. Of course, equally important is for the employees to be able to meet with the Board members in person and see us for who we are\ufffd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- You have also visited Indianapolis, US and Washington, UK in your role as an Employee Champion\ufffd What were your key take-aways from these trips?\n- A In Washington, UK, after the tour of the site facilities, we held a roundtable where employees were very friendly and engaging. I saw and heard first-hand how employees drive i nnovation and automation of key shop floor processes and the key role they play in driving change.\n- In Indianapolis, the focus was on safety, talent and the work with the unions. This was supported by a tour of the test facilities and, again, a roundtable with employees who each shared their perspective on the key topics and their experiences.\n\n## D&I is undoubtedly an important area which is very clearly acknowledged across all of Rolls-Royce\n\n- Q Having now completed your formal induction programme and been able to visit the businesses, how would you describe the culture in Rolls-Royce? And how important do you think diversity and inclusion is across the Group?\n- A The Rolls-Royce culture is one of immense importance in both the Company and in the Group's legacy and achievements\ufffd This can be felt across all key sites and there is an overwhelming common theme of pride in all the businesses. Wearing both my Employee Champion and Director hat, D&I is undoubtedly an important area which is very clearly acknowledged across all of Rolls-Royce. This is complimented by a constant focus on further action - taking D&I beyond being simply a scorecard exercise\ufffd",

During the year, we made changes to the committees' memberships. Lord Jitesh Gadhia joined the Board in April and assumed the role of Chair of the Remuneration Committee in May following Irene Dorner stepping down. In addition, in May, Paul Adams became chair of the Science & Technology Committee following Sir Kevin Smith stepping down as chair and Wendy Mars was appointed to the Science & Technology Committee.\n\nMost scheduled meetings end with a private discussion of the Non-Executive Directors led by the Chair of the Board or Committee, without the Executive Directors or members of the Executive Team or management present\ufffd\n\n## Additional meetings and sub-committee meetings\n\nThe Board held one additional meeting in 2022, for the approval of the new Chief Executive.\n\nI n support of the committees' work, where there is a requirement for greater, in-depth discussion, we hold deep dives into specific areas of focus outside the meeting schedule:\n\n- -in May, the Audit Committee held two deep dives to discuss our internal controls framework and the hedging policy;\n- -in July, the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee held a deep dive on the HSE accountability framework; and\n- -in December, a training session on climate change was held where all members of the Board were invited to join.\n\n## Non-attendance\n\nBoard members' attendance was once again high in 2022. However, Directors are sometimes unable to participate in certain Board and Committee meetings due to other business commitments. In this situation, they communicate their responses to the matters for consideration to the Chair of the Board and the committees' chairs, where relevant\ufffd\n\nAs part of her executive role, Wendy Mars had a global Cisco leadership event which had been arranged prior to her joining Rolls-Royce. This commitment meant Wendy was unable to attend the Board and committee meetings during November.",

The Audit Committee reported to the Board that a robust assessment of the principal risks and emerging risks facing the Group had been undertaken.\n\n## Group budget and five-year plan\n\nThe Board considered performance against the 2022 Group budget.\n\nIn  January  2023,  the  Board  considered  an early draft of the 2023 budget noting that it was  subject  to  further  review  by  the  newly appointed Chief Executive and the Executive Team. The Board approved the 2023 budget and five-year plan in February 2023 and noted that  further  work  would  be  carried  out  to update  the  five-year  plan  as  part  of  the programme focused on the priorities (see page 12).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Viability statement\n\nThe  Board  agreed  the  viability  statement period to be reported in the Annual Report and Accounts.

The internal review provided the platform and some input for the basis of our questionnaire-based approach. We continued to focus on the themes highlighted in our previous reviews: Board composition and dynamics; the Board's role; and the Board at work, with specific focus on those areas identified in the 2021 review.\n\nWe worked with Lintstock in 2021 and again in 2022. They have no other connection with the Company or its Directors.\n\nThe review took the form of an online questionnaire, designed with assistance from Lintstock, with input from the Chair and the governance team. Lintstock provided an anonymised report and the Chair and Chief Governance Officer, in discussion with the Board, have agreed an action plan for 2023. In addition, the Chair held individual meetings with each Non-Executive Director.\n\n## AREA OF FOCUS\n\n## 2022 FOCUS IDENTIFIED IN 2021\n\n## PROGRESS IN 2022\n\n## FOCUS FOR 2023\n\n## Board composition and dynamics\n\nReview of the remit and member -ship of the Committees.\n\n## The Board's role\n\nThe Board at work\n\n## NOVEMBER\n\nDecision reached to undertake an internal Board effectiveness review and providers approached to support the process\n\nContinued  focus  on  succession planning, including the diversity of the Board and Executive Team.\n\nExecution of strategy, prioritising investments and the oversight of cost management\ufffd\n\nFocus on the impact of external challenges on operational perfor -mance (see pages 18 to 19).\n\nStrengthening relationships with our stakeholders, conscious of the external environment.\n\nStrong focus on engagement with stakeholders (see page 50), including a large and successful Meet the Board event for employees\ufffd\n\n## STAGES OF THE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW\n\n## NOVEMBER\n\nLintstock appointed to support internal effectiveness review\n\n## DECEMBER\n\nQuestionnaire drafted and Chair's input sought\n\nQuestionnaire issued\n\n## JANUARY 2023\n\nBoard to review executive govern -ance and its own committee struc -ture.\n\nContinue  to  work  towards  our diversity & inclusion ambitions.\n\nFocus on strategic choices.\n\nContinued focus on stakeholder engagement, ensuring Board sponsorship of the transformation programme\ufffd\n\n## FEBRUARY 2023\n\nResponses received\ufffd Report reviewed by Chair and Chief Governance Officer and draft action plan for 2023 prepared\n\nBoard reviewed the report and approved the action plan for 2023\n\nChanges to the Board, one new Non-Executive Director and the Chief Executive, during the year.

During 2022, the Committee, led by the Chair, oversaw the search and appointment of a new Chief Executive to replace Warren East following the announcement in February 2022 that Warren would step down at the end of 2022 having served eight years on the Board, almost all as Chief Executive. The Company used MWM Consulting which has no connection with individual directors. Information on the appointment search and process can be found on page 72.\n\nThe Committee oversaw a number of changes to the Non-Executive Directors. One new Non-Executive Director, Birgit Behrendt, will join the Board in May 2023. Lee Hsien Yang stepped down at the end of 2022, having completed his nine-year term on the Board. Mike Manley will also step down from the Board in May 2023 and will not stand for re-election at the AGM. In April, Lord Jitesh Gadhia joined the Board and became Chair of the Remuneration Committee from the conclusion of the 2022 AGM in May. Prior to this appointment, Jitesh had been a member of the remuneration committee at Taylor Wimpey since March 2021. Also following the AGM in May 2022, George Culmer replaced Sir Kevin Smith as Senior I ndependent Director and Paul Adams became Chair of the Science & Technology Committee.\n\nFurthermore, during the year, the Committee considered the re-appointment terms of George Culmer and Sir Kevin Smith. It was agreed previously that all Non-Executive Directors would be appointed annually once they reached their third term.\n\nPrior to making any new appointments to the Board, the Committee considers the skills and attributes required and agrees a profile. The Committee also provides input into a shortlist of candidates and is involved in the interview process for all appointments. The Committee recommends the appointments to the Board for approval. All Non-Executive Directors are appointed to the Nominations & Governance Committee and to other Board committees, depending on the skills they bring. See page 60 for our current Board committee membership.\n\nThe Chief Governance Officer ensures that new Directors have a thorough and appropriate induction programme. More detail about inductions and continuing development can be found on page 64.\n\nThe Committee has also considered the following changes to the Board and its committees during 2022 and up to the date of this report. I joined the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee during December and Birgit Behrendt will join the Nominations & Governance and Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committees in May.\n\nSummary biographies for the Directors can be found on pages 62 to 63. Full biographies can be found at www.rolls-royce.com\n\n## Directors' conflicts of interest\n\nAs required under the Code, any additional external appointments taken up by Directors during the year are considered by the Committee and approved by the Board prior to the Directors accepting such appointments. The Committee considers any conflicts that may arise as a result of any external appointments taken up by the Directors and the Board monitors the extent of those interests and the time commitment required to fulfil them to ensure that effectiveness is not compromised. As part of the Committee's discussions, external appointments are considered against the parameters set by ISS. The Committee has found this to be a useful gauge when discussing whether there is potentially any impact on Directors' time commitments when taking on additional external appointments.\n\nIn 2022, the Directors demonstrated a strong commitment to the Company, as shown by their very high levels of attendance at all our meetings (see page 66). During the year, the Board considered the external appointment of Lord Jitesh Gadhia to the Court of Directors of the Bank of England. Other external appointments were also considered during the year and were not considered significant for reporting purposes. The Board concluded that none of the external appointments were considered time restrictive.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nAs part of our succession planning, the Committee considers the current skills, experience and tenure of the Directors and assesses future needs against the longer-term strategy of the Group.\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews succession planning at Board, Executive Team and senior management levels. The Board considered the principal risk relating to talent and capability.\n\nThe Committee plays a vital role in promoting effective Board and leadership succession, making sure it is fully aligned to the Group's strategy. Following the announcement that Warren East would step down as Chief Executive, the Committee continued to regularly discuss succession. A more detailed overview of the Chief Executive's appointment process can be found on page 72.\n\n## Diversity & inclusion\n\nIn 2022, the Committee continued to oversee the development of a diverse pipeline for succession. Diversity and inclusion (D&I) continues to be an area of focus for the Board and for the Group as a whole. We support and monitor Group activities to increase the percentage of senior management roles held by women and other underrepresented groups across the organisation.\n\nThe Board diversity policy maintains a balance so that, as a minimum, 40% of the Directors should be women. It is the Board's longer-term ambition to reach gender parity. We have met the Board's intention that at least one senior Board member will be a woman and that at least one Board member will be from a non-white ethnic minority background. The Board diversity policy is available at www.rollsroyce.com. We have always recognised that there may be changes to the Board where we may fall short of our stated aim for periods of time while the Board is refreshed.",

As noted above, Mike Manley will be stepping down from the Board and Birgit Behrendt will be joining the Board in May 2023, at which time over 41% of the Board will be women. The Committee will continue its work to maintain a balance on the Board of individuals representing a wide cross-section of experience, cultural backgrounds and specialisms.\n\nDiversity in our Executive Team has improved but we recognise that there is still more to do. The Committee continues to support and monitor Group activities to increase the percentage of women and other under-represented groups in the senior management population (see page 40).\n\nImproving D&I across the Group remains a priority and we continue to track progress. We are particularly pleased to note that the number of females in the enterprise leadership group has increased yearon-year (see People and Culture on page 40).\n\nMore on our progress against our D&I targets can be found on page 40. Voluntary disclosures under Listing Rule 9.8.6 can be found on page 209.\n\n## Principal risk review\n\nThe principal risk of talent and capability was considered throughout 2022. The Board met in full to review talent and capability as the development of our leaders is critical to ensuring the right culture and behaviours are embedded across the Group and to ensure we maintain the right skills and capability for future growth.\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nWe strive to take an innovative approach in all that we do and that includes our approach to governance. Throughout 2022, we have continued  to  keep  up-to-date  by  ensuring  agendas  were reflective of the current issues and information provided to the Board was always current and timely.\n\nWe continue to follow the UK BEIS consultation on restoring trust in audit and corporate governance.

The Committee has oversight of the senior leadership development and succession plans, ensuring they are aligned to the long-term strategic ambitions and the diverse leadership needs of the Group. After eight years on the Board and almost all as Chief Executive, Warren East retired as Chief Executive and stepped down from the Board at the end of 2022.\n\nThe Committee, led by the Chair, oversaw the search and appointment of a new Chief Executive. The process was thorough and inclusive. An extensive internal and external search was followed by an interview process which gave the Non-Executive Directors the opportunity to meet the shortlisted candidates. There was good communication throughout the process and the Chair received support from the Chief Governance Officer.\n\nSet out below are the milestone steps that culminated in our announcement in July 2022 of the appointment of Tufan Erginbilgic as our Chief Executive:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further detail on the key stages are outlined below:\n\n## Identify\n\n## Interview\n\n## Select\n\n## Consider\n\n## Appoint\n\nA detailed job specification and preferred attributes of the new Chief Executive were agreed in February. A thorough review of potential internal and external candidates was undertaken, including a long list of external candidates proposed by MWM Consulting. These candidate profiles were made available to Committee members. The Chair, the Senior Independent Director, Sir Kevin Smith and Nick Luff considered the long list of candidates and reduced it to a short list in discussion with MWM Consulting. This included a number of diverse candidates.\n\nAll members of the Board met with and interviewed all candidates on the short list.\n\nTufan Erginbilgic was identified as the preferred candidate during a Board session attended by the Non-Executive Directors only. Tufan Erginbilgic had met with all Board directors and extensive references had been taken and were available to the Committee.\n\nThe  Board  discussed  Tufan  Erginbilgic's  background  in  engineering,  noting  also  that  he  built  his career  in  international  business,  leading  multi-cultural  teams  and  operations  within  complex  multinational organisations. It was recognised that he would bring strategic and operational capabilities and had experience of safety critical industries and an understanding of the challenges and commercial opportunities presented by the energy transition.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee approved the terms and conditions relating to Tufan Erginbilgic's remuneration.\n\nThe Board unanimously approved the appointment of Tufan Erginbilgic and the appointment was announced on 26 July 2022.",

I would like to thank him for his commitment and contribution to the Committee. The Committee membership is set out on page 60.In accordance with the Code and DTR 7.1, George Culmer, Beverly Goulet and I have recent and relevant financial experience. The Board has confirmed that it believes that the Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the Company's sector.\n\nIn 2022, we were pleased to have the opportunity to meet with several shareholders in person as well as hearing virtually from shareholders at our 2022 AGM, where we were able to answer questions both in person and via the live stream of the meeting.\n\nThis report sets out the work of the Committee in 2022. It has been another busy year for the Committee as we continued to focus on the issues relevant to the Group's financial reporting, considering how business performance is reflected in financial reporting, assessing key accounting judgements and ensuring ongoing quality of the related disclosures. We have ensured, as the commitments the Group made in 2020 were delivered, in particular with the disposal of ITP Aero, that the appropriate accounting judgements and assessments were made. We reviewed changes to the foreign exchange hedging policy. In our meetings, we have robust conversations to ensure management are challenged, to satisfy ourselves that the judgements taken and the disclosures made are appropriate for the Group.\n\nWe have continued to support the Board in its considerations of climate change risk and opportunity and, together with the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee, we have overseen the reporting against the TCFD recommendations. We also reviewed the impact of the Group's climate strategy on the 2022 financial statements including the assumptions used in the forecasts for the assessment of going concern and viability, long-term contract accounting, impairment testing and deferred tax asset recognition.\n\nWe undertook deep dives of the principal risks we oversee, particularly in relation to business continuity. The Committee continued to receive regular reports from internal audit, overseeing delivery of the 2022 audit plan and approving the 2023 plan. The Data Security sub-committee, comprising myself and George Culmer, met three times  in  the  year,  to  focus  on  the  cyber  threat principal risk.\n\nThe Committee received a briefing on the UK BEIS consultation on 'restoring trust in audit and corporate governance' following BEIS announcing that it intends to take forward a number of the proposed reforms. We have continued to monitor the Group's internal control framework and its effectiveness across the business throughout 2022 with the appropriate lens so that any final recommendations by BEIS are incorporated in our processes. Over the coming months, we will review communications from both BEIS and the FRC and we will also consider related consultations and guidance. As the landscape becomes clearer, most likely in 2023, work will begin particularly in the areas of assurance and non-financial controls, to ensure the Group is able to meet the new requirements and the directors have sufficient support to enable them to provide the enhanced statements and disclosures.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee received individual business presentations focused primarily on business governance, including risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Group has complex long-term contract accounting and every year the Committee spends much of its time reviewing the accounting policies and judgements implicit in the Group's financial results. In 2022, in addition to our scheduled workload, we have focused on the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the ongoing macro-economic challenges that exist globally. In particular, we have considered the implications of these circumstances on our assumptions and key accounting judgements, including the recovery of Civil Aerospace engine flying hours, inflationary assumptions and discount rates. We have also reviewed the accounting judgements associated with the disposal of ITP Aero in September 2022. In addition, during 2022, the Committee considered the impact of the Group's climate strategy on the assumptions and scenarios used by management.\n\nWe have ensured that the disclosures, in respect of all key areas of judgement, are appropriate and balanced. We assess and consider the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in key assumptions which are summarised in note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 113.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nAs part of its review of the 2022 Annual Report, the Committee considered whether the report, taken as a whole, was fair, balanced and understandable and that it provided the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy. In so doing, the Committee considers the processes and controls involved in preparing the report. There is a robust governance framework to ensure the report is critically reviewed and signed off by key business and function teams. The Committee was satisfied that the process was effective and confirmed to the Board that, when taken as a whole, the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.",

The Committee concluded that there was no undue prominence of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Long-term contract  accounting               | The Committee considered the assessment of estimates of future revenue and costs on the Group's complex,  long-term contractual arrangements. This has continued to be a particular focus for the Committee due to  the impact of changing macro-economic conditions, in particular on our Civil Aerospace business. As part of  our considerations, we reviewed onerous contracts and the carrying value and recoverability of tangible and  intangible assets. We reviewed the disclosures and concluded these, together with the assessments, were                               |\n| Deferred tax assets                          | The Committee discussed the recoverability of deferred tax assets and the forecasts, assumptions and  sensitivities  applied in order to ascertain the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. The Committee  discussed the basis for the recognition of the UK deferred tax assets and considered the judgements and  estimates necessary to assess the recoverability of the UK deferred tax assets. We confirmed the approach,  which remained consistent with that taken in 2021, together with the disclosures set out in note 1 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements. |\n| Impact of climate change                     | The approach taken by management to assess the impact of climate change, the conclusions reached and  the disclosures presented have been reviewed by the Committee, including considering the related TCFD  recommendations. This included understanding and challenging the assumptions in the climate scenarios  used  by  management  to  sensitise  forecasts  in  respect  of  going  concern,  viability,  long-term  contract  accounting, impairment assessments and deferred tax asset recognition. See note 1 in the Consolidated  Financial Statements.                 |\n| Sales of spare engines                       | Throughout the year, the Committee kept under review the assessment of whether the sales of spare engines,  either  to  related  or  third  parties,  represented  a  sale  and  was  at  fair  value.  The  Committee  challenged  management on the approach, the accounting and the reporting of these transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Accounting for complex  treasury instruments | The Committee considered numerous topics in relation to the complex treasury instruments including the  GBP : USD hedge book and associated hedge book rates, the long term planning rate used by management  beyond the hedge book period, and the deal contingent forward foreign exchange contracts entered into to  hedge the proceeds from the ITP disposal. This included understanding and challenging management on the                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n## Risk management and the internal control environment\n\nOur risk management and internal control framework is described on page 42. During the year, we focused on the effectiveness of risk mitigation, understanding our appetite for taking risk as described on pages 42 to 43, including in respect of business continuity activities following consideration of the lessons learned as a result of COVID-19 and more recent challenges caused by the RussiaUkraine conflict. We will continue to focus on risk mitigation effectiveness and risk appetite in 2023, embedding these more firmly as part of our routine processes and decision making, including in relation to strategic planning.\n\nWe also satisfied ourselves that the processes for identifying and managing risks are appropriate and that all principal risks and mitigating actions had been subject, during the year, to a detailed review by the Board or an appropriate Board Committee. Based on this and on our other activities, including consideration of the work of internal and external audit and attendance at the Committee by business and functional risk owners, we reported to the Board that a robust assessment of the principal risks and emerging risks facing the Group had been undertaken. Details of our principal risks are\n\nset out on pages 43 to 47. The Board allocated certain principal risks to the Committee and we considered these in detail throughout the year, as described below. From our discussions, we are satisfied that the principal risks that we oversee have received appropriate management attention during the year:\n\n- -Business Continuity: the Committee received updates on the status of the continuity risk management of each business, including the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on both our supply chain and operations in particular for the Power Systems business.\n- -Cyber: at each meeting of our data security committee, cyber security risks are considered together with lessons learnt from incidents and assessment of risk management effectiveness. The cyber security strategy was kept under review during the year.\n- -Financial Shock: the Committee has reviewed the Group's policies, procedures and controls for identifying, managing and mitigating financial shock. The Group is exposed to a number of financial risks, some of which are of a macroeconomic nature (for example, foreign currency, oil price, interest rates) and some of which are more specific to the Group (for example, liquidity and credit risks).",

        "page_content": "## Internal financial control\n\nThe Committee specifically reviews the Group's internal financial controls (see page 42). During 2022, we reviewed the results of selfattestation and testing performed by the internal control and internal audit teams to confirm the effective operation of key financial controls across the Group. We monitored progress against the 2022 financial controls programme to strengthen the financial reporting and compliance controls. We confirmed completion of identified key activities. We also considered the external auditor's observations on the financial control environment.\n\n## Effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems\n\nThe Committee has conducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems, including those relating to the financial reporting process. We consider that our review of the risk management and internal control systems, in place throughout 2022 and up to the date of this report, satisfies the requirements of the Code, the DTR and the FRC's guidance on risk management. To support this:\n\n- -we monitor changes to regulatory requirements with respect to risk management on an ongoing basis;\n- -we review relevant policies and procedures and update where necessary, in line with regulatory changes and our perspective on effective approaches to risk management;\n- -our risk management team and relevant assurance functions, such as internal audit, review key business processes, including long-term contract pack reviews and the budgeting process with periodic reforecasting, identifying key risks and opportunities;\n- -we assess and monitor management responses to key audit findings, including the design of mitigations and developments to existing controls;\n- -a  defined  Anti-Bribery  and  Corruption  policy  has  been implemented; and\n- -where necessary, we report to the Board and its committees on key risk and regulatory matters.\n\nDuring the course of the financial year, any control weaknesses identified through the operation of our risk management and internal control processes were subject to monitoring and resolution in line with our normal business operations.\n\nTo further support the enhancement of the existing internal control environment:\n\n- -risk management specialists have been assigned to review and monitor the implementation of actions, to ensure these remain appropriate and aligned to the risks to which they relate;\n- -policies and procedures are subject to review and are updated to align to changes in the underlying control environment; and\n- -risk owners remain informed of the risks they are accountable for, and their key responsibilities with regards to managing these risks.\n\nIn addition, and on an ongoing basis, the Board review the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control system and continues to:\n\n- -monitor reports from the Executive Team, relating to their assessment of risks and internal control systems;\n- -monitor assurance received from the Executive Team regarding compliance to relevant policies;\n- -monitor assurance received on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control environment;\n- -review reports from the Audit Committee, Internal Audit function and the external auditor;\n- -review the Company's response to incidents and threats, including those related to cybersecurity and safety; and\n- -review information gathered from the Company's formal whistleblowing process.\n\nWhere opportunities for improvement were identified, action plans have been put in place and progress is monitored by the Audit Committee.\n\n## Going concern and viability statements\n\nHaving regard to the net liabilities of \u00a36,016m on the Group's 2022 balance sheet, we paid particular attention to these assessments. With consideration to the available information, the Audit Committee confirms it maintains a reasonable expectation that the Company is able to continue to meet its liabilities as these fall due, over the five year period to 31 December 2027.\n\nWe reviewed the processes and assumptions underlying the going concern and viability statements set out on pages 48 to 49, considering in particular:\n\n- -the Group's forecast funding position over the next five years;\n- -the forecasts for material subsidiaries making up this position;\n- -an analysis of impacts of severe but plausible risk scenarios, ensuring that these included relevant principal risks;\n- -the impact of multiple risks occurring simultaneously;\n- -additional mitigating actions that could be taken in extreme circumstances; and\n- -the current borrowing facilities in place and the availability of future facilities.\n\nAs a result, we are satisfied that the going concern and viability statements have been prepared on an appropriate basis.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe director of risk and internal audit regularly attends and reports to the Committee on risk and internal audit matters including:\n\n- -identifying key trends and headline findings from internal audit reports issued in the period;\n- -details of any specific significant findings raised by internal audit that warrant the Committee's attention;\n- -status of agreed actions arising from internal audit work;\n- -the plan of internal audit work for the following year; and\n- -progress against the current year's internal audit plan and any changes to the plan.\n\nI meet the director of risk and internal audit regularly throughout the year to discuss risk matters and the nature of internal audit findings in more depth. We continue to focus on the nature of issues raised by internal audit and the timescales to complete the related actions. The future work plan is risk-based, including risks to both short and longer-term objectives and balancing focus on principal risk areas and on business-as-usual transactional activity where controls are understood to be mature and established. Internal audit also incorporates the activities of our second line assurance functions in their approach. We considered and reviewed the",

Based on the reports and discussion, we are satisfied that the scope, extent and effectiveness of internal audit work are appropriate for the Group and that there is an appropriate plan in place to sustain this.\n\n## External audit\n\nPwC were appointed as the Group's external auditor for the financial year, commencing on 1 January 2018, following a formal tender process in 2016. As required by auditor rotation rules, Ian Chambers, who has been the lead audit partner since PwC were appointed, is required to rotate after five years. He will be replaced by Ian Morrison following the completion of the 2022 audit. Other key audit partners are also required to rotate every five years.\n\nThe external audit contract will be put out to tender at least every ten years. Any future audit tenders will be carried out in line with the FRC's practice aid for audit committees.\n\nOther than the services detailed below, PwC have no other connection with the Company or its Directors.\n\n## 2022 audit\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quality of the external audit throughout the year and considered the performance of PwC. This year, to support this, the Committee members and senior finance personnel have undertaken an internal evaluation, focusing on a range of factors we consider relevant to audit quality. The findings from this evaluation and agreed actions were reviewed and approved by the Committee in February 2023. Feedback was also received from the auditors on their performance against their own objectives.\n\nBased on these reviews, the Committee concluded that there had been appropriate focus and challenge by PwC on the primary areas of the audit and that they had applied robust challenge and scepticism throughout the audit. Consequently, the Committee has recommended to the Board that they be reappointed at the 2023 AGM.\n\nIn November, PwC presented its formal audit plan, which identified i t s assessment of the key audit risks and the proposed scope of audit work. Reflecting on findings from the half-year review and the developments in the Group, we agreed the approach and scope to be undertaken. Key risks and the audit approach to these risks are discussed in the Independent Auditor's Report (pages 185 to 198), which also highlights the other risks that PwC drew to our attention.\n\nAs part of the reporting of the half-year and full-year results, in August 2022 and February 2023, PwC reported to the Committee on its assessment of the Group's judgements and estimates in respect of these risks and the adequacy of the reporting. Where effective to do so, PwC also reported on its assessment of the Group's controls.\n\nI meet with the lead partner regularly throughout the year and the whole Committee has a private meeting with PwC at least once a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nTo safeguard the auditor's independence and objectivity, and in accordance with the FRC's ethical standard, we do not engage PwC for any non-audit services, except where it is work that they must, or are clearly best-suited to, perform. Accordingly, our policy for the engagement of the auditor to undertake non-audit services broadly limit these to audit-related services such as reporting to lenders and grant providers, where there is a requirement by law or regulation to perform the work. All other non-audit services are considered on a case-by-case basis in light of the requirements of the ethical standards and in compliance with our own policy.\n\nFees paid to PwC are set out in note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 137. All proposed services must be pre-approved in accordance with the policy which is reviewed and approved annually. Above defined levels, my approval is also required before PwC is engaged. We also review the non-audit fees charged by PwC on a quarterly basis. Our non-audit services policy can be found at www.rolls-royce.com.\n\nNon-audit related fees paid to the auditor during the year were \u00a31.5m (2021: \u00a31.9m), representing 11% (2021: 14%) of the audit fee. This included \u00a30.7m (2021: \u00a30.7m) relating to the review of the half-year results. Our annual review of the external auditor takes into account the nature and level of all services provided.\n\nBased on our review of the services provided by PwC and discussion with the lead audit partner, we concluded that neither the nature nor the scale of the non-audit services gave any concerns regarding the objectivity or independence of PwC.\n\n## Compliance\n\nDuring 2022, the Company complied with the relevant provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, as disclosed within the external audit section.\n\n## Nick Luff\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

I would like to thank my predecessor, Irene Dorner, for her hard work and dedication during her time as Chair of the Committee and for the time and effort that she put in to ensure a smooth handover of responsibilities.\n\nThis letter outlines the key decisions taken by the Committee during 2022, both in relation to policy and changes in leadership, with the retirement of Warren East in December 2022 and the appointment of our new Chief Executive, Tufan Erginbilgic, in January 2023. The letter also sets out the impact that the external challenges have had on the Group, with global inflationary pressures and the cost of living crisis leading to several extraordinary reward interventions for the wider workforce.\n\n## Business context for 2022\n\nAlthough our results improved year-on-year there is still much to do to strengthen the balance sheet and achieve our ambition of returning to an investment grade credit rating in the medium term.\n\nIn 2022 we faced significant external headwinds including global i nflationary pressures, supply chain disruption and the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Despite this, the management team delivered on  their  commitments  and  we  consider  that  this  should be fairly recognised. The foundations have been laid for the transformation and recovery to accelerate in 2023 and beyond, as we aim to deliver greater, sustainable value to our shareholders. The external challenges faced in 2022 in turn led to internal challenges with higher than anticipated wage inflation for all of our employee groups. This has had an impact on Group-level operating costs and this is reflected in the 2022 Incentive Plan outturn.\n\n## Retirement of Warren East\n\nIn February 2022, Warren announced that he would retire from the Board and step down as Chief Executive at the end of the year. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank Warren for helping me pick up my duties as Chair of the Committee. I would also like to commend Warren on his achievements during his tenure, in particular his leadership during the pandemic.\n\nAs a good leaver, the Committee has agreed that the incentive award made to Warren in respect of the 2021 annual Incentive Plan will be fully preserved and that Warren will be eligible to receive the annual Incentive Plan award for 2022 in full. In line with the remuneration policy, the 2021 and 2022 incentives are awarded entirely in deferred shares. Under the current remuneration policy, Warren received 30% of his salary deferred into shares each month. This arrangement\n\nstarted in June 2021 and ended in December 2022. In line with the policy, these awards will vest on a monthly basis starting in June 2023 and end in December 2024. Warren has received no payments for loss of office.\n\nThe performance conditions for the LTIP award granted to Warren in 2020 have not been met and this award will formally lapse on the five-year anniversary of the grant in March 2025.\n\n## Appointment of new Chief Executive\n\nA key focus for the Committee in 2022 was agreeing the remuneration for the new Chief Executive, Tufan Erginbilgic. The search to replace Warren was international and focused on leaders with  proven experience of operating in a global industrial organisation. The global talent pool for potential chief executives is small and consequently very competitive in terms of reward. Tufan's remuneration package was subject to much consideration, with inputs received from our external advisers Willis Towers Watson (WTW), and I am pleased that our policy gave us the necessary flexibility to design a compensation package that is both competitive and strongly aligned to shareholder interests. The reward package for the Chief Executive is in line with the policy, with a maximum total incentive opportunity of 385% of salary, all of which will be paid as deferred shares; 30% of salary paid as shares which will be deferred for two years; and a pension cash allowance of 12%, in line with the wider workforce.\n\nTufan's base salary is at the upper quartile when benchmarked against other chief executives in the FTSE 100, reflecting his background in private equity and his proven track record for leadership and delivery in complex global industrial organisations. The Committee feels that this salary reflects the complexity of the markets that we operate in, the technology and the ongoing transformation needed to restore the balance sheet and to return Rolls-Royce to an investment grade credit rating. The Committee also considered that the circumstances during Warren's tenure led to him receiving only one pay increase in the last five years of his tenure, resulting in his salary not moving with the market.\n\nRecognising the compensation which Tufan will forego as a result of leaving his previous employment, he will receive two tranches of Rolls-Royce shares, each worth \u00a33.75m at the date of grant, which will be in March 2023. The shares will vest equally in March 2027 and March 2028 and will be subject to malus and clawback conditions. To further strengthen the link between executive remuneration and the interests of shareholders, the Chief Executive's shareholding requirement has increased from 250% to 400% of salary.\n\nThe Committee agreed that for 2023 the incentive targets for the Chief Executive will be based solely on in-year targets agreed in early 2023, ensuring that his reward reflects business performance from the start of his tenure. The targets focus on the key drivers of transformational performance which will underpin future strategy.\n\n## Remuneration decisions related to 2022\n\n## Compliance with the policy\n\nThe current remuneration policy was agreed by shareholders at the AGM in 2021 and runs until the end of 2023. Key features of the policy can be found on page 80 and how it operated during 2022 on pages 80 to 81.",

        "page_content": "## Alignment with the wider workforce\n\nTo ensure alignment with the wider workforce, the Incentive Plan metrics were cascaded to the wider Group, with c.60% of the global population in scope of an incentive plan that replicated these metrics. When the annual results are announced each year, we communicate directly with colleagues, confirming how business performance has impacted their incentive and how the Incentive Plan structure for Executive Directors flows through to the wider workforce. Regular updates on performance against incentive targets are also shared across the Group during the year.\n\n## Incentive outturn in respect of 2022\n\nThe Incentive Plan was designed to incentivise the execution of business strategy, and the achievement of personal objectives, weighted 80% towards business objectives and 20% towards personal performance. Incentive metrics for 2022 represent an evolution of the policy, transitioning from a focus on short-term performance in 2021, reflecting the importance of restoring financial stability at the time, to measures which balance short-term and longer-term performance. Our 2022 priorities were cash generation and achievement of targeted disposals to strengthen the balance sheet (aligned with our ambition to return to investment grade credit rating) and profit improvement targeting improved margins, enabled partly through cost base control. The cost base control targets were set to ensure that costs taken out of the business in 2021 endured as load recovered in 2022. The 2022 Incentive Plan metrics can be found on page 86, with 90% of the metrics relating to financial targets which reflects the priority for the Group at this time.\n\nThe Executive Team has delivered on its commitments in 2022, despite significant headwinds, achieving business performance in line with budget.\n\nAt Group level, adjusted free cash flow was \u00a3546m, which was above the maximum target set by the Committee, therefore generating a maximum outturn.\n\nOperating profit for 2022 was above target, led by growth in Civil Aerospace and Power Systems.\n\nMaintaining control over operating costs in an environment of high inflation, including wage inflation, was challenging in 2022. The Group achieved an outturn of between base and target, driven by higher than budgeted pay and benefits in Civil Aerospace and Defence, plus higher indirect costs.\n\nOur key non-financial metric is people engagement, measured by our annual engagement survey delivered by Gallup. I am delighted to see that positive progress was made for the third successive year and that the Group is on-track to achieve top quartile status for manufacturing companies by the end of 2023. In 2022, we achieved 75% participation and a score of 3.85, which was marginally above target.\n\nThe Incentive Plan in 2022 comprised two longer-term metrics set at the start of 2021. Cumulative free cash flow was above target, driven primarily by Civil Aerospace cash flow being ahead of target. Net debt reduction was also ahead of target, driven by the completion of four disposals since 2020, including the sale of ITP Aero in 2022, the proceeds from which were used to repay a \u00a32bn loan.\n\nIn agreeing the Incentive Plan outturns, the Committee gave consideration to the experience of both internal and external stakeholder  groups,  in  particular  our  colleagues  and  our\n\nshareholders. These results have been delivered in a year which has seen higher than budgeted wage settlements and a number of extraordinary reward interventions to support colleagues with the cost of living crisis.\n\nI n line with our established approach, and as emphasised during the consultation with shareholders in 2021, the formulaic outturns have been carefully reviewed and discretion applied to adjust for items which do not appropriately reflect underlying business performance and to ensure that the incentive target and outturn are comparable. We also make adjustments for disposals and business structure changes.\n\nOnce these adjustments were made, this resulted in an Incentive Plan outturn of 131% (75% of maximum). When personal performance was taken into account, this led to a weighted outturn of 129% for Warren. The Committee believes that this outturn is deserving and recognises Warren's steadfast focus to deliver throughout a turbulent and demanding period, as well as an excellent handover of executive responsibility to Tufan. The weighted outturn for Panos Kakoullis was 129%. The Committee took into account the fact that the incentive will be delivered fully in shares with vesting dates in 2026 and 2027 and the deferral of salary into shares on a monthly basis, therefore aligning the interests of the Executive Directors with the interests of the shareholders. Incentive payments will also be made to all eligible employees across the Group, reflecting the achievements of 2022.\n\n## Wider workforce\n\nGlobal inflationary pressures created cost of living pressures for our people across many of our global locations. We have also observed extremely competitive talent markets. These factors have led to some specific reward interventions during 2022.\n\nI n the early part of 2022, the annual salary review process took place for our global leadership population, with an average increase of 3%. Towards the end of the first quarter, as inflation started to rise, i t  b ecame clear that salary budgets would need to be revised upwards. The UK negotiated increase was settled at 6.5% and the UK average salary increased by 5.7% during 2022. This has impacted operating costs across the Group but was appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nTo help balance a need to support colleagues and to protect the financial position of Group, one-off payments have been paid to supplement consolidated pay increases: \u00a31,500 payment was made to UK represented colleagues in October 2022, along with a 6.5% increase to base pay, and \u00a32,000 was made to the most junior level of leaders in our UK population.\n\nIn Germany, a tariff deal was agreed which covered the period from October 2022 to September 2024 and provides an increase of 5.2% from June 2023 and 3.3% from May 2024. It also provides two one-off payments of \u20ac1,500 each, paid over two years.\n\nAs an organisation we continue to have a strong focus on diversity and inclusion, believing that having a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce makes us a stronger company. We have voluntarily published our UK ethnicity pay gap for the second time in 2022, following the gender pay gap reporting methodology and I am pleased to report that both our gender and ethnicity pay gaps have reduced in 2022. We continue to focus on increasing diverse talent and have structured development programmes in place to help retain and develop diverse talent. Over time these strategies will reduce our pay gap further as we increase representation, particularly in senior roles.",

These targets will align with our transformation programme and will support the delivery of a high quality and competitive business, focused on profitable performance and operational efficiency; improving sustainable cash flows; and a strong balance sheet and growing shareholder returns.\n\n## Summary implementation of the remuneration policy in 2023 Salary review\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the salary for the Chief Financial Officer and has concluded to make an award of 4% from 1 March 2023. This is below the average annual base pay increase for the wider management population and reflects prevailing wage inflation in the UK for this role. The Committee also considered the fact that Panos Kakoullis received a 2.5% increase in 2022 in line with the UK management population, while increases for the wider workforce were substantially higher than this. Base pay increases for the wider UK workforce are subject to negotiation and increases for 2023 have not yet been agreed.\n\n## Incentive Plan operation\n\nThe targets set in respect of the Incentive Plan for 2023 are set out in the Remuneration report. The 2023 incentive for Panos Kakoullis as set out in the policy comprises a 50%/50% combination of short and long-term metrics. The Committee agreed that Tufan Erginbilgic should be incentivised only on business performance during his tenure and so will be 100% based on in-year metrics.\n\n## Remuneration Committee advisers\n\nDuring 2022, the Committee had access to advice from WTW. Total fees for the advice provided to the Committee during the year by WTW were \u00a3108,200 (2021: \u00a326,000 by WTW and \u00a347,800 by Deloitte). Fees are based on a time and materials basis. WTW also provided human capital and benefits services to the Company. No Directors have a connection to WTW.\n\nThe Committee requests that WTW attend meetings periodically during the year. The Committee is exclusively responsible for reviewing, selecting and appointing its advisers and is satisfied that the advice it has received has been objective and independent and that there is no conflict of interest associated with any advice provided. WTW is a member of the remuneration consulting group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\n## Members\n\nLord Jitesh Gadhia (Chair)\n\nGeorge\u00a0Culmer\n\nBeverly Goulet\n\nSir Kevin Smith\n\nBiographies are on pages 62 to 63\n\nRemit\n\nSee page 61\n\n## Summary\n\nI have been delighted to join the Board as Chair of the Committee this year and am energised by the agenda that is being laid out for the future.\n\nWe are now in the third year of the remuneration policy and I am pleased that it has allowed us to support the business through the challenges of COVID-19, in particular the ability to align the interests of our management team with those of our shareholders. I look forward to engaging with shareholders during the course of 2023 to discuss a new policy in support of our 'winning together' transformation programme and our future priorities.\n\n## Lord Jitesh Gadhia\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

Incentive metrics for 2022 represent an evolution of the policy, transitioning from focusing on short-term performance in 2021, which reflected the importance of restoring financial stability at that time, to measures which balance short and longer-term performance. The key measures which reflect our 2022 priorities of cash generation and a strengthened balance sheet are shown below, together with their impact on 2022 incentive outturns:\n\nAnnual metrics and weighting:\n\n| Underlying operating profit/(loss) (20%) *   | Free cash flow (20%) *   | Operating costs (10%) *   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| \u00a3618m                                        | \u00a3546m                    | \u00a3(5,355)m                 |\n| 152% of target incentive                     | 175% of target incentive | 62% of target incentive   |\n\nLong-term metrics (set at the start of 2021) and weighting:\n\n| Cumulative free cash flow (2 year) (20%) *   | Net debt reduction (20%) *   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| \u00a3(1,203)m                                    | \u00a3(1,404)m                    |\n| 118% of target incentive                     | 124% of target incentive     |\n\n- *  Adjusted performance metrics (see page 87)\n\nIn addition, the people score is measured as part of the incentive, which delivered 108% of target incentive (see page 86 for further detail).\n\nThe overall Group outturn of 131% after discretion was applied by the Committee (see page 78). The Committee considers this a fair outcome given the challenging business context.\n\nLooking forward, we plan to continue to tailor the incentive metrics to align with the strategic focus of the business. For 2023, our hybrid incentive structure includes in-year performance measures and longer-term three-year performance measures. The long-term metrics are cash, TSR and product related CO 2 sustainability. All of these targets were agreed in 2021, and were intended to form 50% of the weighted outturn for any incentive payable in 2023. This structure will apply to the Chief Financial Officer in 2023, but the incentive targets for the Chief Executive will be based solely on in-year targets agreed in January 2023. The in-year targets have been reviewed and will focus on the key drivers of transformational performance, which will underpin future strategy and which have been agreed by the Committee. Operating cost and operating profit margin will be included as key strategic performance measures, each with a relative 15% weighting in respect of the in-year performance measures for the Chief Executive and 7.5% for the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Alignment with shareholders\n\nThe policy has been designed to ensure alignment with shareholders through a significant part of the overall reward package being delivered in shares with long holding periods:\n\n- -30% of salary for the Chief Executive and 20% for the Chief Financial Officer is deferred into shares for two years; and\n- -all incentive awards are delivered in shares in March following the performance year, 40% held for three years and 60% for four years. No cash incentive has been awarded for 2022 and this will continue for the life of the policy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Provision 40 factors\n\nWhen developing the remuneration policy and considering its implementation for 2022, the Committee was mindful of the Code and considers that the executive remuneration framework appropriately addresses the following factors:\n\n## Clarity\n\nSimplicity\n\nRisk\n\nPredictability\n\nProportionality\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\nWe provide open and transparent  disclosures  regarding  our  executive  remuneration  arrangements.  We made these arrangements transparent through disclosure in the 2020 Annual Report, before the policy was implemented, as well as consulting with our largest shareholders and proxy agencies.\n\nRemuneration arrangements for our senior leadership and our wider workforce are simple in nature and well understood  by  both  participants  and  shareholders.  Consultations  with  our  shareholders  enabled  us  to explain the context for the bespoke approach to executive remuneration and why it was appropriate for Rolls-Royce in the challenging circumstances. Our shareholders gave us valuable feedback to enable us to finalise  the  policy  and  we  have  received  a  good  level  of  support  for  both  the  overall  approach  and  the detailed policy.\n\nThe Committee considers that our variable pay structure does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking. The incentive structure introduced in 2021 reduced the maximum award and resulted in the incentives being delivered  fully  in  shares.  All  awards  are  ultimately  determined  by  the  Committee  after  the  end  of  the performance period and discretion may be applied.\n\nOur remuneration policy contains details  of  maximum  opportunity  levels  for  each  component  of  pay,  with actual incentive outcomes varying depending on the level of performance achieved against specific measures.\n\nThe metrics used to measure performance for incentive awards drive behaviours that are closely aligned to our vision and strategy. In particular, our variable pay arrangements continue to focus on delivering the Group's priorities.\n\nThe  incentives  are  subject  to  the  achievement  of  stretching  performance  targets  and  the  Committee's holistic assessment of performance that can result in the application of discretion.\n\nThe use of holding periods, the deferral of a proportion of salary into shares with holding periods and our shareholding requirements (including after leaving employment with Rolls-Royce) provide a clear link to the ongoing performance of the business and, therefore, alignment with shareholders.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions also apply to the Incentive Plan.\n\nThe  devastating  impact  of  COVID-19  on  the  aerospace  sector  forced  the  Committee  to  review  the remuneration policy in 2020 to ensure that it was right for the circumstances and supported the necessary restructure and recovery required to secure future growth. As such, a bespoke solution was developed and tailored to the specific challenges facing the Group.\n\nThe  policy  was  aimed  at  retaining  talent,  placing  emphasis  on  short-term  performance  turning  into longer-term  growth,  emphasising  shares  and  long-term  holding  of  those  shares  and  ensuring  alignment between Executive Directors and the wider organisation.\n\nTo  ensure  alignment  to  the  wider  organisation,  we  introduced  a  new  Incentive  Plan,  reduced  maximum potential awards and reduced pension contributions. To ensure alignment to shareholders, we delivered incentives fully in shares and deferred salary into shares.",

The financial threshold for 2022 was to ensure that Group operating costs did not exceed \u00a35,403m. Personal performance objectives are set at the beginning of the year and are aligned with the Group's priorities.\n\nFor Executive Directors, these have included:\n\n- -deliver on cash and profit targets;\n- -support customers by meeting delivery and quality targets;\n- -drive simplicity and efficiency, measured by tracking resource level against external benchmarks;\n- -drive diversity through inclusivity, aiming for a Gallup Q12 score of 3.84;\n- -drive sustainability roadmap by transitioning investment towards net zero technologies;\n- -deliver health and safety targets and change the focus from lagging to leading indicators;\n- -support the Board on Chief Executive succession; and\n- -strengthen risk management and internal controls.\n\nThe Committee assesses performance against the objectives. The overall assessed percentage is based on the Committee's judgement and may include other factors and achievements in the year.\n\nBoth Warren East and Panos Kakoullis led the Group to deliver on financial commitments, navigating inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. Key achievements include:\n\n- -delivery of financial commitment, including growth in revenue and profitability and a return to positive cash flow despite slower than planned engine flying hour recovery, global inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions;\n- -completion of the programme of disposals, achieving \u00a32bn in total proceeds which was used to repay debt;\n- -completion of the internal restructuring programme ahead of schedule;\n- -extensive supply chain disruption managed effectively to protect customers wherever possible;\n- -continued delivery of strong year-on-year improvement on engagement, achieving an above target result on the Gallup Q12 engagement survey;\n- -health and safety targets met, with a 5% decrease in total recordable injuries when compared to 2021, and the safety index performance showing improvements; and\n- -exceptionally professional and diligent handover of responsibility to the incoming Chief Executive by Warren East.\n\n## d) Rolls-Royce Long-Term Incentive Plan (audited)\n\nPrior to 2021, conditional share awards were made to Warren East under the LTIP to reward the execution and development of the business strategy over a three-year performance period. The conditional shares are then subject to a further two-year holding period.\n\n## 2020 LTIP awards\n\nThe following sets out details in respect of the March 2020 LTIP award for which the final year of performance was the 2022 financial year. The performance conditions were assessed to the end of 2022 and were not met. The performance adjustment will be made on the threeyear anniversary of the grant, in March 2023, and the award will formally lapse on the original vesting date in March 2025.\n\n|                                                                  | Weighting   | Threshold (20% vesting)   | Mid (50% vesting)   | Maximum (100% vesting)   | Performance  achieved   | Vesting as a %  of maximum   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|\n| CPS                                                              | 60%         | 162p                      | 203p                | 244p                     | (68p)                   | 0%                           |\n| EPS                                                              | 20%         | 85p                       | 106p                | 127p                     | (65p)                   | 0%                           |\n| Relative TSR v FTSE 100 constituents                             | 10%         | Median                    |                     | Upper  quartile          | Below  median           | 0%                           |\n| Relative TSR v constituents of the S&P  Global Industrials index | 10%         | Median                    |                     | Upper  quartile          | Below  median           | 0%                           |",

This will continue in 2023 and any awards will be made based on 80% Group performance and 20% individual performance. The maximum incentive opportunity for Tufan Erginbilgic will be 385% of salary and for Panos Kakoullis will be 333% of salary. Any incentive payable will be delivered in shares. If shareholding requirements are not met at the point of vesting, Executive Directors may only dispose of up to 50% of shares vesting.\n\nIn 2021, the Incentive Plan focused on short-term measures which incentivised pace of action at a time of market uncertainty, but incorporated longer-term cumulative measures in 2022 and 2023. For 2022, the Group's measures and weightings were:\n\n- -annual targets:\n- \u00b7 free cash flow (20%)\n- \u00b7 operating profit (20%)\n- \u00b7 cost base control (10%)\n- \u00b7 people (10%)\n- -long-term targets:\n- \u00b7 cumulative cash flow (two year) (20%)\n- \u00b7 net debt reduction (20%)\n\nFor 2023, the Incentive Plan metrics will combine annual and longer-term metrics for the Chief Financial Officer and annual metrics only for the Chief Executive. The Committee agreed that it was appropriate for the Chief Executive's 2023 incentive to be measured only on business performance during his tenure.\n\n## e) Pensions (audited)\n\nExecutive Directors are offered membership of a defined contribution plan. A cash allowance may be payable in lieu of pension contributions. From 1 January 2021, all Executive Directors are offered a maximum employer contribution of 12% of salary into the defined contribution pension plan (or cash allowance of equivalent value). This aligns to the average rate for the UK workforce. Executive Directors do not have a prospective entitlement to a defined benefit pension.\n\nIn 2022, Both Warren East and Panos Kakoullis received a cash allowance in lieu of pension contributions.\n\n## Payments to past directors (audited)\n\nJasmin Staiblin stepped down as a Non-Executive Director from the Board on 13 May 2021. She was appointed as a member of the supervisory board of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG on 10 June 2021 and chair of the supervisory board, executive committee, audit committee and mediation committee of Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG on 11 June 2021. Payments of \u00a3300,200 have been made to Jasmin in 2022 in relation to her appointment (2021: \u00a3109,300). No other payments have been made to past directors during the year.\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited)\n\nWarren East stepped down from the Board and retired from the Group on 31 December 2022. He received no payments for loss of office.\n\n## Implementation of remuneration policy for 2023\n\nBase salaries are: Tufan Erginbilgic - \u00a31,250,000; Panos Kakoullis - \u00a3724,880.\n\n30% of Tufan Erginbilgic's salary and 20% of Panos Kakoullis' salary is deferred into shares for two years.",

shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting in May 2024. Although the construct of this policy is not known at this time, performance metrics with a three-year performance period (ending 31 December 2024) have been set to enable continuity of reward for rolling periods of long-term performance. The extent to which these targets will apply to the Chief Executive will form part of the policy consultation.

It retains its overriding ability to apply discretion to adjust any formulaic outcome to ensure that the final outcome is fair and justified in the context of the overall performance of the business.\n\nThe Incentive Plan opportunities and time horizons will operate as per the remuneration policy.\n\n## Compensation for remuneration forfeited from previous employment\n\nTufan Erginbilgic became Chief Executive on 1 January 2023 and in line with the remuneration policy will be compensated for remuneration forfeited from previous employment. This compensation will be in the form of a grant of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc shares to the value of \u00a37.5m. The award of shares will be made in March 2023 and the number of shares subject to the award will be calculated using the average closing share price during the month prior to joining (December 2022); 50% of the award will vest in March 2027 and 50% in March 2028, subject to continued employment. The award will be subject to the Rolls-Royce malus and clawback policy. In recognition of the award of shares, the shareholding requirement for the Chief Executive has increased to 400% of salary.",

The performance conditions of each award were assessed to the end of 2020, 2021 and 2022 respectively and were not met. The performance adjustment has been/will be made on the threeyear anniversary of the grant and the awards will formally lapse on the five-year anniversary of the grant (8 March 2023, 15 March 2024 and 16 March 2025 respectively).\n\n30% of Warren East's salary and 20% of Panos Kakoullis' salary was deferred into shares for two years. During 2022, shares were awarded on a monthly basis from January to December at market price under the rules of the Incentive Plan (the date of grant in the table above is the last grant made in 2022). These shares will vest on a monthly basis from January 2024 (the date of vest/lapse in the table above is the vest date of the last grant made in 2022).

The shareholding requirement is 400% for the Chief Executive (250% before 1 January 2023) and 200% for the Chief Financial Officer. Share interests that are included in the shareholding requirements are as follows: shares vested from Company share plans; shares held in the individual's own name or by a nominee; shares held by a person closely associated (PCA) (as defined by UK Market Abuse Regulation) where the PCA has given express permission; shares held as part of the SharePurchase Plan; and, the estimated net-of-tax shares held in trust as part of unvested awards under the Rolls-Royce Incentive Plan where the awards are not subject to any performance conditions.\n\nIndividuals are expected to meet the shareholding requirement within five years of becoming subject to the policy. Where the shareholding requirements are not met, individuals may only dispose of shares in the following circumstances: to cover taxation; to cover any costs associated with the vesting or exercise of a share award; up to 50% of any shares acquired following the vesting of an award under the Incentive Plan; in connection with the operation of the malus and clawback policy; or where the Committee determines there are exceptional circumstances.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, Warren East's shareholding represented 281% of his base salary and Panos Kakoullis' shareholding represented 97% of his base salary (having been subject to the policy since May 2021). This has been calculated by reference to the three-month average share price to 30 December 2022, being the last working day of the year.\n\nExecutive Directors are also required to retain the lower of their shareholding requirement or their actual shareholding at the date of leaving for 12 months after leaving and then half of that amount for the following 12 months. Warren East has agreed to hold shares in accordance with the shareholding requirements policy until January 2025.\n\n## Executive Directors' contractual arrangements\n\nEach Executive Director has a service agreement that sets out their contract with the Company.\n\n|                   | Effective date of contract   | Notice period from Company   | Notice period from individual   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Tufan Erginbilgic | 1 January 2023               | 12 months *                  | 12 months *                     |\n| Panos Kakoullis   | 3 May 2021                   | 12 months                    | 12 months                       |",

As outlined on page 83, the Committee has considered the wider workforce context in terms of alignment of total reward for the Executive Directors. The majority of employees participate in an incentive plan, with a good degree of alignment of financial measures with the Executive Directors' Incentive Plan. We also encourage all eligible employees to join our all employee share plans, with approximately 50% of our global population enrolling in our most recent ShareSave plan, and approximately 35% of the UK population participating in our SharePurchase Plan.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that the median pay ratio for 2022 is consistent with the pay and progression policies for the Group's UK employees as a whole.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe following chart sets out the percentage change in payments to shareholders and overall expenditure on pay across the Group.\n\n## PAYMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS (\u00a3M)\n\n|   (Consolidated cash flow statement) |         |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                 2022 | 0  (0%) |\n|                                 2021 | 0  (0%) |\n\n<!-- image -->",

No individual may be involved in setting his or her own fee. The Chair and the Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's share schemes, incentive arrangements or pension schemes. A facility is in place which enables Non-Executive Directors (who reside in a permitted dealing territory) to use some or all of their fees, after the appropriate statutory deductions, to make market purchases of shares in the Company on a monthly basis. Lee Hsien Yang and Wendy Mars used this facility.\n\n|                                                        |   2022 \u00a3000 |   2021  \u00a3000 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Chair                                                  |         490 |          490 |\n| Other Non-Executive Directors base fee                 |          70 |           70 |\n| Chair of the Audit Committee                           |          25 |           25 |\n| Chair of the Remuneration Committee                    |          20 |           20 |\n| Chair of the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee |          20 |           20 |\n| Chair of the Science & Technology Committee            |          20 |           20 |\n| Senior Independent Director                            |          15 |           15 |\n| Lead Employee Champion                                 |          15 |           15 |",

        "page_content": "## SAFETY, ETHICS & SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE REPORT\n\n## KEY AREAS OF FOCUS IN 2022\n\nReviewed and advised on a simplified product safety performance reporting process across each business\n\nOversight of the development of a climate-related governance structure, TCFD reporting and separate Climate Review\n\nReviewed the impact of the Government's sanctions regime as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict\n\n## Activities and overview of 2022\n\nFirstly, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Dame Anita Frew who formally joined the Committee on 1 January 2023. I would also like to thank Lee Hsien Yang for his valued contribution to the Committee as he stepped down from the Board at the end of 2022.\n\nThroughout 2022, the Committee continued to monitor the Group's product safety management, HSE performance, ethics and compliance programme and our climate and sustainability agenda.\n\n## Product safety\n\nOne of the Committee's main priorities was to closely review the process for identifying and managing in-service product safety issues. We received a quarterly report from the group chief engineer detailing the status of all open product safety issues across the Group. Monitoring in-service safety issues in this way is, by its nature, a reactive check on the effectiveness of the Group's product safety management system. Therefore, we also reviewed in detail the businesses' proactive analysis of the management of product safety against identified control areas using the safety assurance framework.\n\nThe Committee also received detailed reports from the engineering directors responsible for product safety in each of the businesses, providing an update on safety topics, the status and effectiveness of the product safety management system, their priorities for the year and an assessment of their position against the defined risk appetite for the Group. This year, we have given particular focus to product safety management in Rolls-Royce Electrical, given that this is a new market for the Group.\n\nFinally, we scrutinised the planned activities of the product safety assurance team in identifying and introducing improvements to product safety policies, processes, training and the wider product safety management system.\n\n## HSE\n\nAnother focus for the Committee was HSE performance Groupwide; we received detailed statistics on total reportable injuries and other safety performance indices. We also monitored adherence to our lifesaving rules and our progress against the Group's HSE improvement programmes, offering advice, challenge and insight where necessary.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  the  year,  we  analysed  the  impact  of COVID-19 and scrutinised the Group's continuing approach and mitigating actions. I would like to thank our HSE community and our colleagues for their dedication to making our sites safe places to work during the pandemic.\n\nWe received a series of reports on asset integrity across the Rolls-Royce estate from the site professional services director, resulting in a review of our capital maintenance budget and the initiation of a footprint rationalisation programme.\n\nWe also received regular reports from the operations directors regarding HSE performance and plans and their position against the defined risk appetite in each business.\n\nThe Committee held a deep dive into the findings of an internal audit of the Group's HSE accountability framework. We heard from the operations directors in each business about the findings of the audit and their agreed action plans. We then monitored progress against these action plans throughout the rest of the year.\n\nFinally, we reviewed the Group's HSE strategic plan, risk profile and safety targets.\n\n## Sustainability\n\n2021 was an important year for sustainability at Rolls-Royce and key highlights included the publication of our decarbonisation pathway and active participation at COP26. In 2022, the Committee continued to monitor and support the delivery of the Group's climate and sustainability agenda.\n\nClimate-related governance was also reviewed during the year. A new climate steering committee was created to support the existing executive-level environment & sustainability committee. The steering committee defined six primary workstreams to prioritise activity in 2022 and its membership includes representatives from each of the businesses and key functions. We advised on the development of the governance model and received regular updates on the progress of the workstreams.\n\nThe Science-Based Targets (SBTs) initiative is widely regarded as the gold standard for corporate commitments to decarbonisation so, as a Committee, we have been very close to the Group's progress towards setting SBTs. We have also advised the sustainability team on their work to incorporate emissions from our product testing activities into our climate-related target setting as we transition to validated SBTs.\n\nThe Committee also continued to review the Group's preparation for both TCFD reporting and the separate Climate Review. Particular focus was given during 2022 to the assessment of organisational resilience in the face of climate change; metrics and targets; and the review of outputs of climate-related physical risk impact assessments, including making recommendations for further modelling. The Climate Review can be found at www.rolls-royce.com\n\nLooking at sustainability in its broadest sense, the Committee received regular updates on the topic of human rights. In line with i ncreased scrutiny and legislative requirements, a Group-wide human rights development programme has been established to drive and co-ordinate activity. This programme has included revisions to Group policies and the introduction of a human rights impact assessment and due diligence process to mitigate human rights related risk across the Group. The programme also led to the introduction of appropriate escalation frameworks to embed results into business decision-making.\n\nThe Committee was kept up to date on a communication and engagement programme to increase employee awareness and involvement in sustainability matters. Finally, we analysed the Group's community investment approach, strategy and impact.",

        "page_content": "## Ethics and compliance\n\nI am pleased to report that in January 2022 the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) filed a notice releasing us from the UK Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA). I would like to thank our ethics and compliance team for their work over the past five years towards achieving this outcome. The SFO requested that we conduct an external assurance exercise before being released from the DPA. Forensic Risk Alliance (FRA) were appointed to consider the progress and status of our ethics and compliance programme, since the issue of Lord Gold's report and against the context of significant economic and related challenges, including COVID-19. FRA were asked to consider whether the programme continues to be sustainable and dynamic in the longer term. Throughout the year, we have monitored progress against improvement actions that were identified by the ethics and compliance team to respond to recommendations made by FRA. We also reviewed other areas of the ethics and compliance programme, including the launch of updated Group policies and the rollout of the know-your-partner procedures and portal.\n\nIn December 2021, the sanctions and export control team began engagement with the businesses on the impact of possible sanctions on Russia in the event of a Russia-Ukraine conflict. When the conflict began, a Russia sanctions group was created to manage the impact while assisting the businesses to understand the sanctions regime. The UK Government amended the sanctions over time and our sanctions and export control team worked diligently to remain aligned to the changing landscape. As a Committee, we kept very close to these developments and received regular reports from the General Counsel and the director of strategic export control.\n\nWe regularly discussed other prosecutorial and regulatory matters with the General Counsel and head of ethics & compliance. In February and July 2022, the Committee assessed and reported to the Board on concerns raised through the speak up line and reviewed detailed reports on significant issues, in line with the Code requirement. An overview of the speak up process is summarised below.\n\nFinally, the Committee received updates on progress against the Group's anti-bullying and harassment campaign. We also received a year-end status report on the Group's mandatory learning completion statistics.\n\n## SPEAK UP LINE\n\nIndividual raises a concern via one of the following speak up channels: manager; local ethics adviser; appropriate subject matter expert; a member of the ethics and compliance team; or the externally hosted speak up line.\n\nThe concern is passed to the speak up team, who review the case information and carry out an initial assessment to determine next steps. Where required, an investigating manager is appointed.\n\nThe speak up team provides details of the concern to the investigating manager who carries out an initial fact-finding exercise to determine the scope of the investigation.\n\nThe investigating manager investigates the concern and, once completed, submits a fact-finding report and root cause worksheet to the speak up team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Members\n\nRemit\n\nSee page 61\n\n## Principal risks\n\nWe undertook a review of the product safety, people safety, compliance and climate change principal risks as well as reviewing emerging risks across the Group relevant to the Committee's remit.\n\n## Dame Angela Strank\n\nChair of the Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDame Angela Strank (Chair) Paul Adams\n\nDame Anita Frew\n\nBiographies are on pages 62 to 63\n\nAny follow up actions are tracked until completion and the case is closed by the speak up team.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Safety, Ethics & Sustainability Committee assesses concerns raised through the speak up channels and reviews reports of significant issues twice a year and reports these matters to the Board.",

This enabled us to focus on reviewing the development of the Group's engineering capability in line with our future technology needs.\n\nSir Kevin Smith stepped down as Committee Chair following the May meeting and I would like to thank Sir Kevin for his commitment and leadership of the Committee. I would also like to thank the work of our technology community and the flexibility, resilience and commitment of our people during these challenging times.\n\n## Technology strategy\n\nDuring the year, we reviewed the strategic direction of the Group's research technology and development activities, with consideration to their environmental impacts amongst other matters, and to ensure investment was appropriately allocated. We reviewed digital, electrical and hybrid-electric technologies and developments in alternative fuels including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels. Our review involved the primary net zero milestones across the Group and how this was impacted by the 2022 budget and investment allocation. In November, we received an update on the status of the net zero technology plans for each of the businesses. We discussed progress against the net zero technology plan in Civil Aerospace, Defence, Power Systems, Rolls-Royce Electrical, Rolls-Royce SMR and central technologies. In addition, we discussed what the Group should be doing to tackle test emissions beyond procuring sustainable fuels at our testbeds. A separate discussion will be held with engineering in Civil Aerospace to look at what is being done to reduce the amount of fuel being burnt by reducing the test running time.\n\nWe received an update on hydrogen and the Civil Aerospace supersonic  technology  during  May.  In  addition,  we  were presented with an overview of hydrogen and collaboration opportunities together with the mitigation of technical risks. We further considered the option of bioderived SAF and whether hydrogen would be cheaper than power to liquid synthetic SAF. Additional discussions continued on the use of hydrogen in large aircraft propulsion.\n\nDuring November, we reviewed the advanced manufacturing technology infrastructure and how it is aligned to support the businesses, including its role in the gas turbine technology developments within the five-year plan. The Committee discussed medium-term manufacturing technology activities, including technology roadmapping and manufacturing development in our New Markets. Further discussions continued on the granularity behind the identification of the improvement measures.\n\nThe Committee discussed time on wing and the process from design to driving down shop visit costs. The Committee received updates on the methods in place to dissemble and assemble engines with parts being re-used and repaired rather than replaced, taking advantage of new technologies such as additive manufacturing.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the competitiveness of our products and key programmes against key competitors to ensure we enhance our capability to invest and develop. The review was also carried out with consideration given to the capital re-allocation process.\n\nWhile receiving updates from the businesses, we assisted the Board in its oversight of major research and development investment and provided assurance on its competitiveness and the adequacy of technology investment. During the year we had an indepth review of the competitiveness of gas turbines. This focused on whether the Group's planned investments were sufficient to ensure that the Group could protect the current business and secure future opportunities.\n\nThroughout the year, we maintained a strong focus on low carbon technologies which underpin the Group's sustainability strategy and leverage our advanced manufacturing and nuclear power design expertise.\n\n## Cross-sector technology\n\nWe continued to provide oversight of the effectiveness of key engineering and technology processes and operations, including the delivery of major product development and technology programmes.\n\n## Technology capabilities and skills\n\nWe discussed the processes for ensuring there was effective resourcing and development of required technological capability and skills. We received updates from the group chief engineer including an understanding of how productivity drivers are used to drive efficiency throughout the organisation.\n\nThe  Committee  discussed  the  consolidated  research  and technology plan. They received updates on the status of the Group-wide skills programme and how it was intended to support our future strategy. The update on the Group-wide skills programme explained that, following the significant engineering restructure, talent development would be prioritised to enable a skills shift to secure and support future strategy. We reviewed and discussed the global talent pool whilst receiving an update from the science advisory council on the industry-wide difficulties in hiring UK employees with specific software and electrical skills. We acknowledged the challenges with hiring and retention. We recognised that key enablers of the skills-shift included the need to deliver simplified processes and modern, intuitive systems and tools to help reduce any barriers to moving engineers across different disciplines and to support the increase in the number of engineers with system-level skills.\n\nDuring May, we received an update on the split of the workforce deeply skilled versus those multi-skilled. We discussed the programme that supported the model and advised the Civil Aerospace team that the success of the skills programme would be contingent on good behaviours and culture, with the need for a clear recognition system. In addition, we reiterated the need for positive engagement with the wider workforce.\n\nWe further discussed the fellowship programme and the reignited specialist academy.",

Net debt therefore includes the fair value of derivatives included in fair value hedges (2022: \u00a3 38 m, 2021: \u00a3114m) and the element of fair value relating to exchange differences on the underlying principal of derivatives in cash flow hedges (2022: \u00a348m, 2021: \u00a3(77)m)",

In Rolls-Royce Holdings plc's own Financial Statements, C Shares are issued from the merger reserve. This reserve was created by a scheme of arrangement in 2011. As this reserve is eliminated on consolidation in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the C Shares are shown as being issued from the capital redemption reserve.\n\nHedging reserves - Cumulative gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed effective in cash flow hedges and cost of hedging reserve. Merger reserve - The premium on issuing shares to acquire a business where merger relief in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applies\ufffd\n\nTranslation reserve - Gains and losses arising on retranslating the net assets of overseas operations into sterling.\n\nAccumulated losses - All other net gains and losses and transactions with owners not recognised elsewhere and ordinary shares held for the purpose of share-based payment plans.\n\nNon-controlling interests - The share of net assets or liabilities of subsidiaries held by third parties.\n\n## Attributable to ordinary shareholders\n\n|                                                                                                        | Notes   | Share  capital \u00a3m   | Share  premium \u00a3m   | Capital  redemption  reserve \u00a3m   | Hedging  reserves  \u00a3m   | Merger  reserve \u00a3m   | Trans- lation  reserve \u00a3m   | Accum- ulated  losses  2 \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   | NCI \u00a3m   | Total equity \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|----------|-------------------|\n| At 31 December 2021 as previously  reported                                                            |         | 1,674               | 1,012               | 165                               | (45)                    | 650                  |                             | 342  (8,460) (4,662)          |            | 26       | (4,636)           |\n| Adoption of amendment to IAS 37  (post-tax)                                                            | 1       | -

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies\n\n## The Company and the Group\n\nRolls-Royce Holdings plc (the 'Company') is a public company limited by shares incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 and domiciled in England in the United Kingdom. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2022 consist of the audited consolidation of the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) together with the Group's interest in jointly controlled and associated entities.\n\n## Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Company has elected to prepare its individual Company Financial Statements under FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework . They are set out on pages 173 to 178 with the associated accounting policies from page 175.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards (IAS) in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) applicable to companies reporting under UK adopted IFRS.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as described on page 48. The historical cost basis has been used except where IFRS require the revaluation of financial instruments to fair value and certain other assets and liabilities on an alternative basis, most significantly post-retirement scheme obligations are valued on the basis required by IAS 19 Employee Benefits.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling which is the Company's functional currency.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the statutory amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the statutory amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual future outcomes could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors have undertaken a comprehensive going concern review. In adopting the going concern basis for preparing these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Directors have undertaken a review of the Group's cash flow forecasts and available liquidity, along with consideration of the principal risks and uncertainties over an 18-month period to August 2024. Recognising the challenges of reliably estimating and forecasting the impact of external factors on the Group, the Directors have considered two forecasts in the assessment of going concern, along with a likelihood assessment of these forecasts, being:\n\n- -base case, which reflects the Directors' current expectations of future trading of a steady and ongoing recovery of trading towards pre-pandemic levels; and\n- -stressed downside forecast, which envisages a 'stress' or 'downside' situation.\n\nThe future impact of climate change on the Group has been considered through climate scenarios. The climate scenarios modelled do not have a material impact on the cash flow forecasts over the 18-month period to August 2024.\n\nFurther details are given in the going concern review on page 48. After reviewing the current liquidity position and the cash flow forecasts modelled under both the base case and stressed downside, the Directors consider that the Group has sufficient liquidity to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 18 months from the date of this report and are therefore satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements the Directors have considered the potential impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the disclosures included in the Strategic Report and Climate Review this year and the stated decarbonisation strategy. Based on the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, the Group assesses the potential impact of climate-related risks which cover both transition risks and physical risks. The eight key risks and the opportunities considered in the climate scenarios prepared include extensive policy, legal, technological, and market changes and physical risks which could include direct damage to assets and supply chain disruption. Two of the assessed key transition risks have been identified as potentially having a high impact on the Group. These relate to the risk that regulatory changes could materially impact demand for our products and that addressing climate change will require shifting investment focus towards more sustainable products and solutions. Both of these risks are being actively addressed through the Group's decarbonisation strategy and the financial implications, as reflected in the quantified climate scenarios, have been considered when preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set its decarbonisation strategy and identified longer-term considerations in response to the climate challenge and is engaging proactively with external stakeholders to advocate for the conditions that society needs to achieve its net zero target. The Group's main short- and longer-term priorities include:\n\n- -achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 from all energy purchased and consumed in the Group's offices, manufacturing and production activities (with the exception of product testing and development). This will be met through continued i nvestment in onsite renewable energy installations; the procurement of renewable energy; and continued investment in energy efficiency improvements to reduce the Group's overall energy demands and operating costs. An estimate of the investment required to meet these scope 1 and 2 emission improvements is included in the forecasts that support these Consolidated Financial Statements;\n- -the scale up of sustainable fuels that will play a crucial role in reaching net zero carbon. To accelerate this, the Group are working to demonstrate that all the commercial aero engines produced, and the most popular reciprocating engines, representing 80% of the product portfolio, are compatible with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023 and working with our armed forces customers to achieve the same goals for the Rolls-Royce engines they use; and",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\n## Climate change (continued)\n\n-developing breakthrough new technologies, including investment in hybrid-electric solutions in Power Systems, continued development of the more efficient UltraFan aero engine, testing of sustainable aviation fuels, small modular reactors (SMRs) and hybrid and fully electric propulsion. New products will be compatible with net zero operation by 2030 and all products will be compatible with net zero operation by 2050. In the year, R&D costs of \u00a3(108)m (2021: \u00a3(68)m) within New Markets included design development to ready the SMRs to progress through the UK generic design assessment (GDA) process and investment in electrical propulsion technology. Future investment required to deliver these technologies is included in the forecasts that support the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe climate change scenarios previously prepared to assess the viability of our business strategy, decarbonisation plans and approach to managing climate-related risk have continued to develop over the last year as set out in our Climate Review. There remains inherent uncertainty over the assumptions used within these and how they will impact the Group's business operations, cash flows and profit projections. The Directors assess the assumptions on a regular basis to ensure that they are consistent with the risk management activities and the commitments made to investors and other stakeholders.\n\nAssumptions used within the Consolidated Financial Statements in relation to areas such as revenue recognition for long-term contracts, impairment reviews of non-current assets and the carrying amount of deferred tax assets consider the findings from the climate scenarios prepared. Key variables include carbon pricing based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero scenario, which assumes an increase from $46 per tonne of carbon in 2022 to $250 per tonne in 2050, and commodity price, temperature rise and GDP information from the Oxford Economics Global Climate Service Net Zero scenario aligned to IPCC SSP1-19.\n\nAs details of what incremental specific future intervention measures will be taken by governments are not yet available, carbon pricing has been used to quantify the potential impact of future policy changes on the Group. To ensure revenue recognition or the carrying value of assets is not overstated it has been assumed that carbon pricing falls on our own manufacturing facilities and those of our supply chain. The Group will be able to mitigate an element of the financial impact as it reduces the scope 1 and 2 emissions from its offices, manufacturing and production activities, the costs of which have been incorporated into forecasts. The Group has made estimates in relation to decarbonisation in its external supply chain and the impact this may have on the Group's costs, whilst acknowledging in its financial modelling that this is complex and will therefore take some time. The financial modelling performed recognises the extent to which the Group's current supplier contracts offer protection from cost increases in the short to medium term where pricing is fixed or subject to capped escalation clauses. The Group has made a cautious assessment of whether higher costs would be passed on to customers in the short and medium term that considers the markets operated in and the pricing mechanisms in place. For example, in Civil Aerospace it is recognised that escalation caps within a number of its long-term service agreements (LTSA) contracts would be triggered, meaning additional costs could remain within the business under current commercial arrangements until the end of existing contract periods.\n\nWhen determining the amount of cumulative revenue recognised on long-term contracts, and the obligation in relation to onerous contracts, the assumptions above have been used to reflect the climate uncertainties. Changes in estimates have not had a significant impact on revenue catch-ups in the year (2021: \u00a3(17)m) or on contract loss provisions (2021: \u00a3(20)m). Increases in carbon and commodity price estimates over the term of the current contracts are estimated to be around 1% (2021: 1%). A sensitivity is presented within the key sources of estimation uncertainty (page 116) to disclose the impact of a further 1% cost increase that might arise from further unmitigated increases in carbon and/or commodity pricing.\n\nImpairment testing of non-current assets including goodwill and programme assets has considered the above risks as well as assessing how the Group's 1.5 o C and 3.6 o C scenarios may change the demand for products over the medium and longer term. Given the headroom, the climate scenarios modelled do not indicate any potential impairment. Further information is provided in note 9.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the unused tax losses and deductible temporary difference can be utilised. The weighted downside forecast includes the climate-related estimates and assumptions. Whilst carbon pricing illustrates pressure on costs, decarbonisation and new supplier and customer contracts offer the opportunity to receive value for more efficient and sustainable products. Further details are included in note 5 together with sensitivity analysis in the key sources of estimation uncertainty section below.\n\nThe climate-related estimates and assumptions that have been considered to be key areas of judgement or sources of estimation uncertainty for the year ended 31 December 2022 are those relating to the recoverable amount of non-current assets including goodwill, capitalised development costs, recovery of deferred tax assets, recognition and measurement of provisions and recognition of revenue on long-term contracts. These items are included within the key areas of judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty summarised on page 113 and explained in detail throughout the significant accounting policies.\n\nItems that may be impacted by climate-related risks, but which are not considered to be key areas of judgements or sources of estimation uncertainty in the current financial year are outlined on page 112.",

The change in useful lives would have a direct impact on the amount of depreciation or amortisation recognised each year from the date of reassessment. The Directors' review of useful lives has taken into consideration the impacts of the Group's decarbonisation strategy and has not had a material impact on the results for the year. The Directors have also considered the remaining useful economics lives of material intangible assets, including the \u00a31,826m and \u00a3250m capitalised development spend associated with the Trent and business aviation programmes disclosed in note 9. Given the measures the Group is taking, including the testing of engines for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) compatibility and that all the commercial aero-engines and the most popular reciprocating engines that are currently produced will be compatible with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023, the Directors judge that no adjustment is required to the useful economic lives.\n\nInventory valuation - Climate-related matters may affect the value of inventories as a result of a decline in selling prices or could become obsolete due to a reduction in demand. After consideration of the typical stock-turns of the inventory in relation to the rate of change in the market the Directors consider that inventory is appropriately valued.\n\nRecoverability of trade receivables and contract assets - The impact of climate-related matters could have an impact on the Group's customers in the future, especially those customers in the Civil Aerospace business. No material climate-related issues have arisen during the year that have impacted the assessment of the recoverability of receivables. The Group's expected credit loss (ECL) provision uses credit ratings which inherently will include the market's assessment of the climate change impact on credit risk of the counter parties. Given the maturity time of trade receivables and the majority of contract assets, climate change is unlikely to cause a material increase on counter party credit risk in that time.\n\nShare-based payments - Remuneration packages will be impacted and measured against a new sustainability metric from the 2023 financial year. This could impact the future amount and timing of the recognition of the share-based payment expense in the income statement once these metrics are included within the performance condition criteria of the share-based payment plans. This change has had no impact on the 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and is unlikely to have a material impact on the charge recognised in the next 12 months.\n\nDefined benefit pension plans - Climate-related risks could affect the financial position of defined benefit pension plans. As a result, this could have implications on the expected return on plan assets and measurement of defined benefit liabilities in future years. The Trustee of the Rolls-Royce UK Pension Fund meet the climate-related regulatory requirements. When making decisions about the plan, its analysis is carried out in a way consistent with Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The Trustee has set a net zero target for the plan assets by 2050. Having assessed the risks and opportunities of climate change and considered the nature of the assets of the fund, climate change is unlikely to have a material impact on the position in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Presentation of underlying results\n\nThe Group measures financial performance on an underlying basis and discloses this information as an alternative performance measure (APM). This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by the Directors and reported to the Board in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments . The Group believes this is the most appropriate basis to measure the in-year performance, as underlying results reflect the substance of trading activity, including the impact of the Group's foreign exchange forward contracts, which economically hedge net foreign currency cash flows at predetermined exchange rates. In addition, underlying results exclude the accounting impact of business acquisitions and disposals, impairment charges where the reasons are outside of normal operating activities, exceptional items, and certain other items which are market driven and outside of the control of management. Further details are given in note 2. A reconciliation of APMs to the statutory equivalent is provided on pages 203 to 206.\n\n## Revisions to IFRS applicable in 2022\n\nThe Group adopted the amendment to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract on 1 January 2022. The amendment clarifies the meaning of 'costs to fulfil a contract', explaining that the direct cost of fulfilling a contract comprises the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (for example, direct labour and materials) and also an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. As a result of the amendment, the Group now includes additional allocated costs when determining whether a contract is onerous and in the quantification of the provision recognised in the event of a contract being onerous. These additional allocated costs primarily relate to (a) fixed overheads in our operational areas that are incurred irrespective of manufacturing load, (b) fixed overheads of providing services, including engine health monitoring and IT costs, and (c) depreciation of spare engines that the Group owns are used to support the delivery of our contractual commitments to customers under LTSAs. The Group has assessed the impact of this amendment on its contracts and has included additional allocated costs that increased the total contract loss provision by \u00a3723m, as at 1 January 2022 (see note 21). All material elements impact Civil Aerospace contracts. Of this increase, \u00a338m relates to current provisions and \u00a3685m to non-current provisions. A tax credit has not been recognised on the increase in the provision relating to the UK (see note 5 for details). As required by the transition arrangement in relation to the amendment, comparative information has not been restated. The cumulative effect of initially applying the amendment has been recognised as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 January 2022. It is estimated that the impact of the IAS 37 amendment has had a favourable immaterial impact on the 2022 income statement. Further information can be found in note 21.\n\nThere are no other new standards or interpretations issued by the IASB that had a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

The subsequent application of these policies requires estimates, and the actual outcome may differ from that calculated. The key judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are summarised below. Further details, together with sensitivities for key sources of estimation uncertainty where appropriate and practicable, are included within the significant accounting policies section of this note.\n\n| Area                                                       | Key judgements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Key sources of estimation uncertainty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   Page ref |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Revenue  recognition and  contract assets  and liabilities | -

Joint arrangements may be either joint ventures or joint operations. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and joint operations are accounted for using proportionate accounting.\n\nAn associate is an entity that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and where the Group has a significant influence. The results of associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Adjustments are made to eliminate the profit or loss arising on transactions with joint arrangements and associates to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded directly in equity.\n\nAny subsidiary undertaking, joint arrangement or associate sold or acquired during the year are included up to, or from, the date of change of control. Details of transactions in the year are set out in note 27.\n\n## Revenue recognition and contract assets and liabilities\n\nRevenue recognised comprises sales to the Group's customers after discounts and amounts payable to customers. Revenue excludes value added taxes. The transaction price of a contract is typically clearly stated within the contract, although the absolute amount may be dependent on escalation indices and long-term contracts that require the key estimates highlighted below to be made. Refund liabilities, where sales are made with a right of return, are not typical in the Group's contracts. Where they do exist, and consideration has been received, a portion based on an assessment of the expected refund liability is recognised within other payables. The Group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components where the expectation is that the period between the transfer of goods and services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than a year. Consideration is received in the form of deposits and payments for completion of milestones or performance obligations. LTSA cash receipts are typically received based on EFHs.\n\nSales of standard OE, spare parts and time and material overhaul services are generally recognised on transfer of control to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer, unless the specific contractual terms indicate a different point. The Directors consider whether there is a need to constrain the amount of revenue to be recognised on delivery based on the contractual position and any relevant facts, however, this is not typically required.\n\nSales of OE and services that are specifically designed for the contract (most significantly in the Defence business) are recognised by reference to the progress towards completion of the performance obligation, using the cost method described in the key judgements, provided the outcome of contracts can be assessed with reasonable certainty.\n\nThe Group generates a significant portion of its revenue on aftermarket arrangements arising from the installed OE fleet. As a consequence, in particular in the Civil Aerospace large engine business, the Group will often agree contractual prices for OE deliveries that take into account the anticipated aftermarket arrangements. Sometimes this may result in losses being incurred on OE. As described in the key judgements, these contracts are not combined. The consideration in the OE contract is therefore allocated to OE performance obligations and the consideration in the aftermarket contract to aftermarket performance obligations.\n\n## Key areas of the accounting policy are:\n\n- -Future variable revenue from long-term contracts is constrained to take account of the risk of non-recovery of resulting contract balances from reduced utilisation e.g. EFHs, based on historical forecasting experience and the risk of aircraft being parked by the customer.\n- -A significant amount of revenue and cost related to long-term contract accounting is denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant Group undertaking, most significantly USD transactions in sterling and euro denominated undertakings. These are translated at estimated long-term exchange rates.\n- -The assessment of stage of completion is generally measured for each contract. However, in certain cases, such as for CorporateCare agreements, where there are many contracts covering aftermarket services each for a small number of engines, the Group accounts for a portfolio of contracts together, as the effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would not differ materially from applying the standard to the individual contracts in the portfolio. When accounting for a portfolio of LTSAs, the Group uses estimates and assumptions that reflect the size and composition of the portfolio.\n- -A contract asset/liability is recognised where payment is received in arrears/advance of the revenue recognised in meeting performance obligations.\n- -Where material, wastage costs (see key judgements on page 115) are recorded as an exceptional non-underlying expense.\n\nIf the expected costs to fulfil a contract exceed the expected revenue, a contract loss provision is recognised for the excess costs.\n\nThe Group pays participation fees to airframe manufacturers, its customers for OE, on certain programmes. Amounts paid are initially treated as contract assets and subsequently charged as a reduction to the OE revenue when the engines are transferred to the customer.\n\nThe Group has elected to use the practical expedient to expense as incurred any incremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract if the amortisation period of an asset created would have been one year or less. Where costs to obtain a contract are recognised in the balance sheet, they are amortised over the performance of the related contract (two to 13 years).",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\n## Key judgement - Whether Civil Aerospace OE and aftermarket contracts should be combined\n\nIn the Civil Aerospace business, OE contracts for the sale of engines to be installed on new aircraft are with the airframers, while the contracts to provide spare engines and aftermarket goods and services are with the aircraft operators, although there may be interdependencies between them. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers includes guidance on the combination of contracts, in particular that contracts with unrelated parties should not be combined. Notwithstanding the interdependencies, the Directors consider that the engine contract should be considered separately from the aftermarket contract. In making this judgement, they also took account of industry practice.\n\n## Key judgement - How performance on long-term aftermarket contracts should be measured\n\nThe Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue from aftermarket arrangements. These aftermarket contracts, such as TotalCare and CorporateCare agreements in the Civil Aerospace business, cover a range of services and generally have contractual terms covering more than one year. Under these contracts, the Group's primary obligation is to maintain customers' engines in an operational condition. This is achieved by undertaking various activities, such as maintenance, repair and overhaul, and engine monitoring over the period of the contract. Revenue on these contracts is recognised over the period of the contract and the basis for measuring progress is a matter of judgement. The Directors consider that the stage of completion of the contract is best measured by using the actual costs incurred to date compared to the estimated costs to complete the performance obligations, as this reflects the extent of completion of the activities to be performed.\n\n## Key judgement - Whether any costs should be treated as wastage\n\nIn rare circumstances, the Group may incur costs of wasted material, labour or other resources to fulfil a contract where the level of cost was not reflected in the contract price. The identification of such costs is a matter of judgement and would only be expected to arise where there has been a series of abnormal events which give rise to a significant level of cost of a nature that the Group would not expect to incur and hence is not reflected in the contract price. Examples include technical issues that: require resolution to meet regulatory requirements; have a wide-ranging impact across a product type; and cause significant operational disruption to customers. Similarly, in these rare circumstances, significant disruption costs to support customers resulting from the actual performance of a delivered good or service may be treated as a wastage cost. Provision is made for any costs identified as wastage when the obligation to incur them arises - see note 21.\n\n## Key judgement - Whether sales of spare engines to joint ventures are at fair value\n\nThe Civil Aerospace business maintains a pool of spare engines to support its customers. Some of these engines are sold to, and held by, joint venture companies. The assessment of whether the sales price reflects fair value is a key judgement. The Group considers that based upon the terms and conditions of the sales, and by comparison to the sales price of spare engines to other third parties, the sales made to joint ventures reflect the fair value of the goods sold. See note 26 for the value of sales to joint ventures during the year.\n\n## Key judgement - When revenue should be recognised in relation to spare engine sales\n\nRevenue is recognised at the point in time when a customer obtains control of a spare engine. The customer could be a related party, an external operator or a spare engine service provider. Depending on the contractual arrangements, judgement is required on when the Group relinquishes control of spare engines and, therefore, when the revenue is recognised. The point of control passing has been concluded to correspond to the point of legal sale, even for instances where the customer is contracted to provide some future spare engine capacity to the Group to support its installed engine base. In such cases, the customer has responsibility for generating revenue from the engines and exposure to periods of non-utilisation; exposure to risk of damage or loss, risk from residual value movements, and will determine if and when profits will be made from disposal. The spare engine capacity that will be made available to the Group in the future does not consist of identified assets and the provider retains a substantive right to substitute the asset through the Group's period of use. It is, therefore, appropriate to recognise revenue from the sale of the spare engines at the point that title transfers. During 2022, of the total 44 (2021: 36) large spare engine sales delivered, 20 (2021: six) engines were sold to customers where contractual arrangement allows for some future spare engine capacity to be used by the Group. These sales contributed \u00a3454m (2021: \u00a3111m) to revenue for the year.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\nKey estimate - Estimates of future revenue and costs on long-term contractual arrangements\n\nThe Group has long-term contracts that fall into different accounting periods and which can extend over significant periods (generally up to 25 years), the most significant of these are LTSAs in the Civil Aerospace business, with an average remaining term of around ten years. The estimated revenue and costs are inherently imprecise and significant estimates are required to assess: EFHs, time-on-wing and other operating parameters; the pattern of future maintenance activity and the costs to be incurred; lifecycle cost improvements over the term of the contracts; and escalation of revenue and costs (that includes the impact of inflation). The impact of climate change on EFHs and costs is also considered when making these estimates. Industry and customer data on expected levels of utilisation is included in the forecasts used. Across the length of the current Civil Aerospace LTSA contracts, allowance has been made for around a 1% (2021: 1%) projected cost increase resulting from carbon pricing and commodity price changes.\n\nThe sensitivities below demonstrate how changes in assumptions (including as a result of climate change) could impact the level of revenue recognised were assumptions to change. The Directors believe that the estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements take account of the inherent uncertainties, constraining the expected level of revenue as appropriate.\n\nEstimates of future LTSA revenue within Civil Aerospace are based upon future EFH forecasts, influenced by assumptions over the recovery of the civil aviation industry. Finally, many of the revenues and costs are denominated in currencies other than that of the relevant group undertaking. These are translated at an estimated long-term exchange rate, based on historical trends and economic forecasts.\n\nDuring the year, changes to the estimate in relation to the Civil Aerospace LTSA contracts resulted in favourable catch-up adjustments to revenue of \u00a3360m (2021: \u00a3214m).\n\nBased upon the stage of completion of all LTSA contracts within Civil Aerospace as at 31 December 2022, the following reasonably possible changes in estimates would result in catch-up adjustments being recognised in the period in which the estimates change (at underlying rates):\n\n- -A change in forecast EFHs of 1% over the remaining term of the contracts would impact LTSA income and to a lesser extent costs, resulting in an in-year impact of around \u00a320m. This would be expected to be seen as a catch-up change in revenue or, to the extent it impacts onerous contracts, within cost of sales.\n- -A 2% increase or decrease in our pricing to customers over the life of the contracts would lead to a revenue catch-up adjustment in the next 12 months of around \u00a3260m.\n- -A 2% increase or decrease in shop visit costs over the life of the contracts would lead to a revenue catch-up adjustment in the next 12 months of around \u00a3100m.\n\n## Risk and revenue sharing arrangements (RRSAs)\n\nCash entry fees received are initially deferred on the balance sheet within trade payables and other liabilities. They are then recognised as a reduction in cost of sales incurred. Individual programme amounts are allocated pro rata to the estimated number of units to be produced. Amortisation commences as each unit is delivered and then recognised on a 15-year straight-line basis.\n\nThe payments to suppliers of their shares of the programme cash flows for their production components are charged to cost of sales when OE sales are recognised or as LTSA costs are incurred.\n\nThe Group also has arrangements with third parties who invest in a programme and receive a return based on its performance, but do not undertake development work or supply parts. Such arrangements (financial RRSAs) are financial instruments as defined by IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are accounted for using the amortised cost method.\n\nKey judgement - Determination of the nature of entry fees received\n\nRRSAs with key suppliers (workshare partners) are a feature of the civil aviation industry business. Under these contractual arrangements, the key commercial objectives are that: (i) during the development phase the workshare partner shares in the risks of developing an engine by performing its own development work, providing development parts, and paying a non-refundable cash entry fee; and (ii) during the production phase the workshare partner supplies components in return for a share of the programme cash flows as a 'life of type' supplier (i.e. as long as the engine remains in service).\n\nThe non-refundable cash entry fee is judged by the Group to be a contribution towards the development expenditure incurred. These receipts are deferred on the balance sheet and recognised against the cost of sales over the estimated number of units to be delivered on a similar basis to the amortisation of development costs - see page 120.",

Where grants are received in advance of the related expenses, they are initially recognised as liabilities within trade payables and other liabilities and released to match the related expenditure. Non-monetary grants are recognised at fair value.\n\n## Interest\n\nInterest receivable/payable is credited/charged to the income statement using the effective interest method. Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe tax charge/credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax:\n\n- -Current tax is the expected tax payable for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n- -Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes and is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled. In the UK, the deferred tax liability on the pension scheme surplus is recognised consistently with the basis for recognising the surplus i.e. at the rate applicable to refunds from a trust.\n\nTax is charged or credited to the income statement or OCI as appropriate, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint arrangements, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits, which include the reversal of taxable temporary differences, will be available against which the assets can be utilised.

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\nKey estimate - Estimates necessary to assess whether it is probable that sufficient suitable taxable profits will arise in the UK to utilise the deferred tax assets recognised\n\nDeferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available, against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. On this basis a deferred tax asset of \u00a32,040m is not recognised in respect of UK tax losses. Further details are included in note 5.\n\nIn addition to taking into account a severe but plausible downside forecast (see below), the climate-related estimates and assumptions (set out on pages 110 to 112) have also been considered when assessing the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. Recognising the longer terms over which these assets will be recovered, the Group has considered the risk that regulatory changes could materially impact demand for our products and shifting investment focus towards more sustainable products and solutions. The climate scenarios prepared do not indicate a significant deterioration in demand or profitability for Civil Aerospace programmes given that all commercial aero-engines will be compatible with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023.\n\nWhile carbon and commodity pricing may put pressure on costs, decarbonisation and new supplier and customer contracts offer the opportunity to receive value for more efficient and sustainable products.\n\nMacro-economic factors continue to result in uncertainty over the recovery of demand across the civil aviation industry. As explained in note 5, a 25% probability of there being a severe but plausible downside forecast in relation to the civil aviation industry has been taken into account in the assessment of the recovery of the UK deferred tax assets.\n\nThe estimates take account of the inherent uncertainties constraining the expected level of profit as appropriate. Changes in these estimates will affect future profits and, therefore, the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. The following sensitivities have been modelled to demonstrate the impact of changes in assumptions on the recoverability of deferred tax assets.\n\n- -A 5% change in margin in the main Civil Aerospace large engine programmes.\n- -A 5% change in the number of shop visits driven by EFHs.\n- -Assumed future cost increases from climate change expected to pass through to customers at 100% are restricted to 90% pass through.\n\nAll of these could be driven by a number of factors, including the impact of climate change as explained on pages 110 to 112 and changes in foreign exchange rates.\n\nA 5% change in margin or shop visits (which could be driven by fewer EFHs as a result of climate change) would result in an increase/ decrease in the deferred tax asset of around \u00a3130m.\n\nIf only 90% of assumed future cost increases from climate change are passed on to customers, this would result in a decrease in the deferred tax asset of around \u00a350m, and if carbon prices were to double, this would be \u00a380m.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting group undertaking are translated into the functional currency at the average monthly exchange rate when the transaction occurs. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate prevailing at the year end. Exchange differences arising on foreign exchange transactions and the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities into functional currencies at the rate prevailing at the year end are included in profit/(loss) before taxation.\n\nThe trading results of Group undertakings are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year. The assets and liabilities of overseas undertakings, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the year end. Exchange adjustments arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets, and from the translation of the profits or losses at average rates, are recognised in OCI.\n\n## Discontinued operations and business disposals\n\nA discontinued operation is defined in IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations as a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are required to be presented separately in the income statement.\n\nAssets and businesses are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered through sale rather than through continuing use.\n\nKey judgement - The assets, liabilities and associated consolidation adjustments of the ITP Aero business recognised on disposal In identifying the assets and liabilities that form part of the disposal group in relation to the ITP Aero business, the Group has considered whether the associated consolidation adjustments meet the criteria to be classified within the disposal group. The consolidation adjustments allocated to the disposal group are those that relate to the carrying value of the disposal group's assets and liabilities. Further detail can be found in note 27.",

The Group may sell trade receivables due from certain customers before the due date. Any trade receivables from such customers that are not sold at the reporting date are classified as 'held to collect and sell'.\n- -Cash and cash equivalents (consisting of balances with banks and other financial institutions, money-market funds, short-term deposits) and short-term investments are subject to low market risk. Cash balances, short-term deposits and short-term investments are measured at amortised cost. Money market funds are measured at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement as a profit or loss (FVPL).\n- -Derivatives and unlisted investments are measured at FVPL. The Company has elected to measure its listed investments at FVOCI\n\nFinancial liabilities primarily consist of trade payables, borrowings, derivatives, financial RRSAs and C Shares.\n\n- -Derivatives are classified and measured at FVPL.\n- -All other financial liabilities are classified and measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial instruments - Impairment of financial assets and contract assets\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments sets out the basis for the accounting of ECLs on financial assets and contract assets resulting from transactions within the scope of IFRS 15. The Group has adopted the simplified approach to provide for ECLs, measuring the loss allowance at a probability weighted amount that considers reasonable and supportable information about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions of customers. These are incorporated in the simplified model adopted by using credit ratings which are publicly available, or through internal risk assessments derived using the customer's latest available financial information. The ECLs are updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. ECLs are calculated for all financial assets in scope, regardless of whether or not they are overdue.\n\n## Financial instruments - Hedge accounting\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts and commodity swaps (derivative financial instruments) are held to manage the cash flow exposures of forecast transactions denominated in foreign currencies or in commodities respectively. Derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting when: (i) there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge at the inception of the hedge; and (ii) the hedge is expected to be effective.\n\nIn general, the Group has chosen to not apply hedge accounting in respect of these exposures.\n\nThe Group economically hedges the fair value and cash flow exposures of its borrowings. Cross-currency interest rate swaps are held to manage the fair value or cash flow exposures of borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and are designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges as appropriate. Interest rate swaps are held to manage the interest rate exposures of fixed and floating rate borrowings and may be designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges as appropriate. If the swaps are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, the economic effect is included in the underlying results - see note 2.\n\nChanges in the fair values of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognised directly in the income statement. The fair value changes of effective cash flow hedge derivatives are recognised in OCI and subsequently recycled to the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. Any ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship is included in the income statement.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At that time, for cash flow hedges and, if the forecast transaction remains probable, any net cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in SOCIE is retained until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is recycled to the income statement.\n\n## Financial instruments - Replacement of benchmark interest rates\n\nIn August 2020, Phase 2 of IBOR reform was published, effective from 1 January 2021. The amendments address issues that arise from the implementation of the reforms including the replacement of one benchmark with an alternative one. The Phase 2 amendments provide additional temporary reliefs from applying specific IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by IBOR reform.\n\nA number of the Group's lease liabilities are based on a LIBOR index. These are predominantly referencing USD LIBOR, which is not expected to cease until 2023, hence the change in relation to these contracts has not impacted the 2022 financial statements. Amendments to these contracts is in progress at the balance sheet date.",

On transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004, business combinations were not retrospectively adjusted to comply with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards and goodwill was recognised based on the carrying value under the previous accounting policies. Goodwill, in respect of the acquisition of a subsidiary, is recognised as an intangible asset. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint arrangements and associates is included in the carrying value of the investment.\n\n## Customer relationships\n\nThe fair value of customer relationships recognised as a result of a business combination relate to the acquired company's established relationships with its existing customers that result in repeat purchases and customer loyalty. Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 15 years.\n\n## Certification costs\n\nCosts incurred, in respect of meeting regulatory certification requirements for new Civil Aerospace aero-engine/aircraft combinations, including payments made to airframe manufacturers for this, are recognised as intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered out of future sales. They are charged to the income statement over the programme life. Individual programme assets are allocated pro rata to the estimated number of units to be produced. Amortisation commences as each unit is delivered and then charged on a 15-year straight-line basis.\n\n## Research and development\n\nExpenditure incurred on research and development is distinguished as relating either to a research phase or to a development phase. All research phase expenditure is charged to the income statement. Development expenditure is recognised as an internally generated intangible asset (programme asset) only if it meets strict criteria, relating in particular to technical feasibility and generation of future economic benefits. More specifically, development costs are capitalised from the point at which the following conditions have been met:\n\n- -the technical feasibility of completing the programme and the intention and ability (availability of technical, financial and other resources) to complete the programme asset and use or sell it;\n- -the probability that future economic benefits will flow from the programme asset; and\n- -the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the programme asset during its development.\n\nCapitalisation continues until the point at which the programme asset meets its originally contracted technical specification (defined internally as the point at which the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by the Directors).\n\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised where it enhances the functionality of the programme asset and demonstrably generates an enhanced economic benefit to the Group. All other subsequent expenditure on programme assets is expensed as incurred.\n\nIndividual programme assets are allocated pro rata to the estimated number of units to be produced. Amortisation commences as each unit is delivered and then charged on a 15-year straight-line basis. In accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets , the basis on which programme assets are amortised is assessed annually.\n\nKey judgement - Determination of the point in time when costs incurred on an internal programme development meet the criteria for capitalisation\n\nThe Group incurs significant research and development expenditure in respect of various development programmes. Determining when capitalisation should commence and cease is a key judgement, as is the determination of when subsequent expenditure on the programme assets should be capitalised. During the year, \u00a3131m of development expenditure was capitalised.\n\nWithin the Group, there is an established Product Introduction and Lifecycle Management process (PILM) in place. Within this process, the technical feasibility, the commercial viability and financial assessment of the programme is assessed at certain milestones. When these are met, development expenditure is capitalised. Prior to this, expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\nThe Group continues to invest in new technologies as a result of its decarbonisation commitments. As these are new technologies, there is a higher level of uncertainty over potential outcomes and, therefore, this could impact the level of expenditure that is capitalised or recognised in the income statement in future years.\n\nSubsequent expenditure after entry into service which enhances the performance of the engine and the economic benefits to the Group is capitalised. This expenditure is referred to as enhanced performance and is governed by the PILM process referred to above. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nKey judgement - Determination of the basis for amortising capitalised development costs\n\nThe economic benefits of the development costs are primarily those cash inflows arising from LTSAs, which are expected to be relatively consistent for each engine within a programme. Amortisation of development costs is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of operation of the engine by its initial operator.",

The amortisation period of software assets is reviewed annually. In 2022, the amortisation period was changed from a maximum of five years to a maximum of ten years to reflect the expected useful lives of the assets. The change has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and has impacted a limited amount of assets with an immaterial impact on the results for the year.

Estimated useful lives are reassessed annually and are as follows:\n\n- -Land and buildings, as advised by the Group's professional advisers:\n- \u00b7 freehold buildings - five to 50 years (average 23 years); and\n- \u00b7 no depreciation is provided on freehold land.\n- -Plant and equipment - two to 27 years (average 11 years).\n- -Aircraft and engines - five to 20 years (average 16 years).\n\n## Leases\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.\n\nLease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- -fixed payments less any lease incentive receivable;\n- -variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate;\n- -amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- -the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- -payments of penalties for termination of the lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.\n\nWhere leases commenced after the initial IFRS 16 Leases transition date, the lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the Group's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the Group would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions. Where appropriate, lease liabilities are revalued at each reporting date using the spot exchange rate.\n\nThe Group did not adopt the amendment to IFRS 16 Leases , effective in 2022, which provides a practical expedient to not treat COVID-19 rent concessions as lease modifications.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- -the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability or a revaluation of the liability;\n- -any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- -any initial direct costs; and\n- -restoration costs.\n\nEach right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful economic life and the lease term on a straight-line basis unless the lease is expected to transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the Group, in which case the asset is depreciated to the end of the useful life of the asset.\n\nShort-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Payments associated with short-term leases and low-value leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\n## Key judgement - Determination of lease term\n\nIn determining the lease term, the Group considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination) are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Certain land and building leases have renewal options with renewal dates for the most significant property leases evenly spread between 2023-2028 and in 2041. The Group reviews its judgements on lease terms annually, including the operational significance of the site, especially where utilised for manufacturing activities.\n\nKey estimates - Estimates of the payments required to meet residual value guarantees at the end of engine leases Engine leases in the Civil Aerospace business often include clauses that require the engines to be returned to the lessor with specific levels of usable life remaining or cash payments to the lessor. The costs of meeting these requirements are included in the lease payments. The amounts payable are calculated based upon an estimate of the utilisation of the engines over the lease term, whether the engine is restored to the required condition by performing an overhaul at our own cost or through the payments of amounts specified in the contract and any new contractual arrangements arising when the current lease contracts end. Amounts due can vary depending on the level of utilisation of the engines, overhaul activity prior to the end of the contract, and decisions taken on whether ongoing access to the assets is required at the end of the lease term. During the year, adjustments to return conditions at the end of leases resulted in a credit of \u00a34m to the income statement. The lease liability at 31 December 2022 included \u00a3434m relating to the cost of meeting these residual value guarantees in the Civil Aerospace business. Up to \u00a3114m is payable in the next 12 months, \u00a3175m is due over the following four years and the remaining balance after five years.\n\n## Impairment of non-current assets\n\nImpairment of non-current assets is considered in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets . Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent of other assets, impairment is considered for the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. Goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Other intangible assets (including programme-related intangible assets), property, plant and equipment and investments are assessed for any indications of impairment annually. If any indication of impairment is identified, an impairment test is performed to estimate the recoverable amount.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be below the carrying value, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised as an expense. The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use or fair value less costs of disposal, if this is readily available. The value in use is the present value of future cash flows using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the time value of money and the risk specific to the asset (or CGU). Fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) reflects market inputs or inputs based on market evidence if readily available. If these inputs are not readily available, the fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows modified for market participants views. The relevant local statutory tax rates have been applied in calculating post-tax to pre-tax discount rates.\n\nKey judgement - Determination of CGUs for assessing impairment of goodwill\n\nThe Group conducts impairment reviews at the CGU level. As permitted by IAS 36, impairment reviews for goodwill are performed at the groups of CGUs level, representing the lowest level at which the Group monitors goodwill for internal management purposes and no higher than the Group's operating segments. The main CGUs for which goodwill impairment reviews have been performed are Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG and at an aggregated Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG level.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued on a first-in, first-out basis, at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those direct and indirect overheads, including depreciation of property, plant and equipment, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling prices less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. All inventories are classified as current as it is expected that they will be used in the Group's operating cycle, regardless of whether this is expected to be within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand, investments in money-market funds and short-term deposits with a maturity of three months or less on inception. The Group considers overdrafts (repayable on demand) to be an integral part of its cash management activities and these are included in cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement. Where the Group operates pooled banking arrangements across multiple accounts, these are presented on a net basis when it has both a legal right and intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\n\nThe Group offers a supply chain financing (SCF) programme through partnership with banks to enable suppliers, including joint ventures, who are on our standard 75 day or more payment terms to receive their payment sooner. The election to utilise the programme is the sole decision of the supplier. As the Group continues to have a contractual obligation to pay its suppliers under commercial terms which are unaffected by any utilisation of the programme, and it does not retain any ongoing involvement in the SCF, the related payables are retained on the Group's balance sheet and classified as trade payables. Further details are disclosed in note 19.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.\n\nThe principal provisions are recognised as follows:\n\n- -Trent 1000 in-service issues when wastage costs are identified as described on page 115;\n- -contract losses based on an assessment of whether the direct costs to fulfil a contract are greater than the expected revenue;\n- -warranty and guarantees based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience and recognised at the earlier of when the underlying products and services are sold and when the likelihood of a future cost is identified; and\n- -restructuring when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has created a valid expectation to those affected.\n\n## Key judgement - Whether any costs should be treated as wastage\n\nAs described further on page 115, in rare circumstances, the Group may incur costs of wasted material, labour or other resources to fulfil a contract where the level of cost was not reflected in the contract price. The identification of such costs is a matter of judgement and would only be expected to arise where there has been a series of abnormal events which give rise to a significant level of cost of a nature that the Group would not expect to incur and hence is not reflected in the contract price. Provision is made for any costs identified as wastage when the obligation to incur them arises.\n\nSpecifically for the Trent 1000 wastage costs, provision has been made as the Group is an owner of an engine Type Certificate under which it has a present obligation to develop appropriate design changes to address certain engine conditions that have been noted in issued Airworthiness Directives. The Group is also required to ensure engine operators can continue to safely operate engines within the terms of their LTSAs, and this requires the engines to be compliant with the requirements of those issued Airworthiness Directives. These requirements cannot be met without the Group incurring significant costs in the form of replacement parts and customer claims. Given the significant activities of the Group in designing and overhauling aero engines it is very experienced in making the required estimates in relation to the number and timing of shop visits, parts costs, overhaul labour costs and customer claims.\n\nKey estimates - Estimates of the time to resolve the technical issues on the Trent 1000, including the development of the modified HPT blade and estimates of the expenditure required to settle the obligation relating to Trent 1000 claims and to settle Trent 1000 long-term contracts assessed as onerous\n\nThe Group has provisions for Trent 1000 wastage costs at 31 December 2022 of \u00a3179m (2021: \u00a3157m). These represent the Directors' best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligations at the balance sheet date. These estimates take account of information available and different possible outcomes.\n\nThe Group considers that at 31 December 2022 the Trent 1000 contract loss provisions and the Trent 1000 wastage cost provision are most sensitive to changes in estimates. A 12-month delay in the availability of the modified HPT blade could lead to around a \u00a340-70m increase in the Trent 1000 wastage costs provision.\n\nKey estimates - Estimates of the future revenues and costs to fulfil onerous contracts\n\nThe Group has provisions for onerous contracts at 31 December 2022 of \u00a31,592m (1 January 2022: \u00a31,568m).\n\nAn increase in Civil Aerospace large engine estimates of LTSA costs of 1% over the remaining term of the contracts could lead to around a \u00a3100-125m increase in the provision for contract losses across all programmes.\n\nKey estimates - Assumptions implicit within the calculation of discount rates\n\nThe contract loss provisions for onerous contracts are sensitive to changes in the discount rate used to value the provisions. The rate used for each contract is derived from bond yields (i.e. risk-free rates) with a similar duration and currency to the contract that they are applied to. The rate is adjusted to reflect the specific inflation characteristics of the contracts. The forecast rates are determined from third-party market analysis and average 4%. A 1% change in the discount rates used could lead to around a \u00a380-100m change in the provision.\n\n## Customer financing support\n\nIn connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on occasion, provide financing support for its customers. These arrangements fall into two categories: credit-based guarantees and asset-value guarantees. Credit-based guarantees are disclosed as commitments or contingent liabilities dependent on whether aircraft have been delivered or not. The Group considers asset-value guarantees to be non-financial liabilities and provides for amounts required. As described on page 169, the Directors consider the likelihood of crystallisation in assessing whether provision is required for any contingent liabilities.\n\nThe Group's contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio and are reported on a discounted basis.",

Surpluses in schemes are recognised as assets only if they represent economic benefits available to the Group in the future. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in OCI. The service and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement:\n\n- -current service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees;\n- -past-service costs and settlements are recognised immediately; and\n- -financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.\n\nUK pension obligations include the estimated impact of the obligation to equalise defined benefit pensions and transfer values for men and women.\n\nPayments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Key estimate - Estimates of the assumptions for valuing the net defined benefit obligation\n\nThe Group's defined benefit pension schemes and similar arrangements are assessed annually in accordance with IAS 19. The valuations, which are based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice, resulted in a net deficit of \u00a3420m before deferred taxation being recognised on the balance sheet at 31 December 2022 (2021: deficit of \u00a3225m). The size of the net surplus/ deficit is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions, which include the discount rate, price inflation, pension and salary increases, longevity and, in the UK, the number of plan members who take the option to transfer their pension to a lump sum on retirement or who choose to take the Bridging Pension Option. Following consultation, the UK scheme closed to future accrual on 31 December 2020.\n\nA reduction in the discount rate of 0.25% from 4.80% could lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations of the RR UK Pension Fund (RRUKPF) of approximately \u00a3205m. This would be expected to be broadly offset by changes in the value of scheme assets, as the scheme's investment policies are designed to mitigate this risk.\n\nAn increase in the assumed rate of inflation of 0.25% (RPI of 3.50% and CPI of 2.95%) could lead to an increase in the defined benefit obligations of the RRUKPF of approximately \u00a370m.\n\nA one-year increase in life expectancy from 21.9 years (male aged 65) and from 23.2 years (male aged 45) would increase the defined benefit obligations of the RRUKPF by approximately \u00a3165m.\n\nFurther details and sensitivities are included in note 22.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group provides share-based payment arrangements to certain employees. These are principally equity-settled arrangements and are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares or options that will vest, except where additional shares vest as a result market-based performance conditions, such as the total shareholder return (TSR) performance condition in the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), where no adjustment is required as allowance for these performance conditions are included in the initial fair value.\n\nCash-settled share options (grants in the International ShareSave plan) are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The Group recognises a liability at the balance sheet date based on these fair values, taking into account the estimated number of options that are expected to vest and the relative completion of the vesting period. Changes in the value of this liability are recognised in the income statement for the year.\n\nThe cost of shares of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc held by the Group for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of employee share plans is deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet. See note 24 for a further description of the share-based payment plans.\n\n## Costs of share issues\n\nThe costs of issuing ordinary shares are charged to the share premium account.\n\n## Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2022\n\nStandards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the UK. Other than IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts described on page 125, the Group does not consider that any standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable will have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

        "page_content": "## 1  Accounting policies - continued\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 issued in May 2018, establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts within the scope of the Standard. The Standard is effective for years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 with a requirement to restate comparatives.\n\nThe Group has reviewed whether its arrangements meet the accounting definition of an insurance contract. While some contracts, including Civil LTSAs, may transfer an element of insurance risk, they relate to warranty and service type agreements that are issued in connection with the Group's sales of its goods or services and therefore will remain accounted for under the existing revenue and provision standards. The Directors have judged that such arrangements entered into after the original equipment sale remain sufficiently related to the sale of the Group's goods and services.\n\nThe Group has identified that the Standard will impact the results of its captive insurance company as it issues insurance contracts, however, the impact is expected to largely consolidate out in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Standard includes a simplified approach and modifications to its general measurement model that can be applied in certain circumstances. Given the coverage period of these insurance policies within the captive insurance company are 12 months or less, it is intended to make use of the 'premium allocation approach' for the recognition of premiums. The confidence level and risk adjustments have been calculated using a weighted average cost of capital calculation with discount rates based on the European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA) risk-free interest rates. The opening balances on 1 January 2022, as well as the results for 2022, have been run under IFRS 17, and the expected impact on accumulated losses is less than \u00a31m.\n\nThe Group is in the process of concluding its analysis of whether there is any further impact as a result of adopting the new Standard. This will conclude in the first half of 2023. At this time there is no further known or reasonably estimatable information to disclose that is relevant to assessing the possible impact that application of the new IFRS will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Post balance sheet events\n\nThe Group has taken the latest legal position in relation to any ongoing legal proceedings and reflected these in the 2022 results as appropriate.\n\n## 2  Segmental analysis\n\nThe analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments , on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board (who acts as the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8). The Group's four businesses are set out below.\n\nCivil Aerospace\n\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services\n\nDefence\n\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines, naval engines, submarine nuclear power plants and aftermarket services\n\nPower Systems\n\ndevelopment, manufacture, marketing and sales of integrated solutions for onsite power and propulsion\n\nNew Markets\n\ndevelopment, manufacture and sales of small modular reactor (SMR) and new electrical power solutions\n\nOther businesses include the trading results of the Bergen Engines AS business until the date of disposal on 31 December 2021, the results of the Civil Nuclear Instrumentation & Control business until the date of disposal on 5 November 2021 and the trading results of the UK Civil Nuclear business.\n\n## Underlying results\n\nThe Group presents the financial performance of the continuing businesses in accordance with IFRS 8 and consistently with the basis on which performance is communicated to the Board each month.\n\nUnderlying results are presented by recording all relevant revenue and cost of sales transactions at the average exchange rate achieved on effective settled derivative contracts in the period that the cash flow occurs. The impact of the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities using the exchange rate that is expected to be achieved by the use of the effective hedge book is recorded within underlying cost of sales. Underlying financing excludes the impact of revaluing monetary assets and liabilities to period end exchange rates. Transactions between segments are presented on the same basis as underlying results and eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised fair value gains/(losses) on foreign exchange contracts, which are recognised as they arise in the statutory results, are excluded from underlying results. To the extent that the previously forecast transactions are no longer expected to occur, an appropriate portion of the unrealised fair value gain/(loss) on foreign exchange contracts is recorded immediately in the underlying results.\n\nAmounts receivable/(payable) on interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedge relationships for accounting purposes are reclassified from fair value movement on a statutory basis to interest receivable/(payable) on an underlying basis, as if they were in an effective hedge relationship.\n\nIn the year to 31 December 2022, the Group was a net seller of USD at an achieved exchange rate GBP:USD of 1.50 (2021: In the first half of the year, the Group was a net purchaser of USD at an achieved exchange rate GBP:USD of 1.39. In the second half of 2021, the Group was a net seller of USD at an achieved exchange rate of GBP:USD of 1.59) based on the USD hedge book.",

These USD cash flows have been used to establish the extent of future USD hedge requirements. In 2020, the Group took action to reduce the size of the USD hedge book by $11.8bn across 2020-2026, resulting in an underlying charge of \u00a31.7bn being recognised within underlying finance costs and the associated cash settlement costs occurring over the period 2020-2026. The derivatives relating to this underlying charge have been subsequently excluded from the hedge book, and, therefore, are also excluded from the calculation of the average exchange rate achieved in the current and future periods. This charge was reversed in arriving at the 2020 statutory performance on the basis that the cumulative fair value changes on these derivative contracts are recognised as they arise.\n\nUnderlying performance also excludes the following:\n\n- -the effect of acquisition accounting and business disposals;\n- -impairment of goodwill, other non-current and current assets where the reasons for the impairment are outside of normal operating activities;\n- -exceptional items; and\n- -certain other items which are market driven and outside of the control of management.\n\n## Acquisition accounting, business disposals and impairment\n\nThe Group exclude these from underlying results so that the current year and comparative results are directly comparable.\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nItems are classified as exceptional where the Directors believe that presentation of the results in this way is useful in providing an understanding of the Group's financial performance.

Examples of exceptional items include one-time costs and charges in respect of aerospace programmes, costs of restructuring programmes and one-time past service charges and credits on post-retirement schemes.\n\nSubsequent changes in exceptional items recognised in a prior period will also be recognised as exceptional. All other changes will be recognised within underlying performance.\n\nExceptional items are not allocated to segments and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Other items\n\nThe financing component of the defined benefit pension scheme cost is determined by market conditions and has therefore been included as a reconciling difference between underlying and statutory performance.\n\nThe tax effects of the adjustments above are excluded from the underlying tax charge. In addition, changes in tax rates or changes in the amount of recoverable deferred tax or advance corporation tax recognised are also excluded.\n\nThe following analysis sets out the results of the Group's businesses on the basis described above and also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.\n\nCorporate\n\n|                                                    | Civil  Aerospace  \u00a3m   | Defence  \u00a3m   | Power  Systems  \u00a3m   | New  Markets  \u00a3m   | Other  businesses  \u00a3m   | and Inter- segment  \u00a3m   | Total  Underlying \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December 2022                        |                        |               |                      |                    |                         |                          |                        |\n| Underlying revenue from sale of original equipment | 1,982                  | 1,634         | 2,187                | 1                  | -                       | (5)                      | 5,799                  |\n| Underlying revenue from aftermarket services       | 3,704                  | 2,026         | 1,160                | 2                  | -                       | -                        | 6,892                  |\n| Total underlying revenue                           | 5,686                  | 3,660         | 3,347                | 3                  | -                       | (5)                      | 12,691                 |\n| Gross profit/(loss)                                | 853                    | 726           | 918                  | (1)                | (29)                    | 10                       | 2,477                  |\n| Commercial and administrative costs                | (371)                  | (174)         | (441)                | (23)               | (2)                     | (51)                     | (1,062)                |\n| Research and development costs                     | (452)                  | (122)         | (204)                | (108)              | -                       | -                        | (886)                  |\n| Share of results of joint ventures and associates  | 113                    | 2             | 8                    | -                  | -                       | -                        | 123                    |\n| Underlying operating profit/(loss)                 | 143                    | 432           | 281                  | (132)              | (31)                    | (41)                     | 652                    |\n| Year ended 31 December 2021                        |                        |               |                      |                    |                         |                          |                        |\n| Underlying revenue from sale of original equipment | 1,612                  | 1,411         | 1,744                | -                  | 155                     | (11)                     | 4,911                  |\n| Underlying revenue from aftermarket services       | 2,924                  | 1,957         | 1,005                | 2                  | 148                     | -                        | 6,036                  |\n| Total underlying revenue                           | 4,536                  | 3,368         | 2,749                | 2                  | 303                     | (11)                     | 10,947                 |\n| Gross profit/(loss)                                | 474                    | 721           | 778                  | 1                  | 32                      | (10)                     | 1,996                  |\n| Commercial and administrative costs                | (297)                  | (161)         | (383)                | (3)                | (20)                    | (35)                     | (899)                  |\n| Research and development costs                     | (434)                  | (105)         | (157)                | (68)               | (10)                    | -                        | (774)                  |\n| Share of results of joint ventures and associates  | 85                     | 2             | 4                    | -                  | -                       | -                        | 91                     |\n| Underlying operating (loss)/profit                 | (172)                  | 457           | 242                  | (70)               | 2                       | (45)                     | 414                    |",

Underlying financing excludes the impact of revaluing monetary assets and liabilities at the year-end exchange rate\n- 2 The underlying results exclude the fair value changes on derivative contracts held for trading. These fair value changes are subsequently recognised in the underlying results when the contracts are settled\n- 3 In 2020, the Group took action to reduce the size of the USD hedge book by $11.8bn across 2020-2026, resulting in an underlying charge of \u00a31.7bn at 31 December 2020. In 2021, this estimate was updated to reflect the actual cash cost and resulted in a \u00a315m gain to underlying finance costs\n- 4 Includes the gains on hedge ineffectiveness in the year of \u00a31m (2021: losses of \u00a31m) and net fair value gains of \u00a3190m (2021: gains of \u00a380m) on any interest rate swaps not designated into hedging relationships for accounting purposes\n- 5 During the year to 31 December 2022 and 2021, contract loss provisions previously recognised in respect of the Trent 1000 technical issues which were identified in 2019 have been reversed due to a reduction in the estimated cost of settling the obligation\n- 6 During the year to 31 December 2022, the Group recorded an exceptional restructuring charge of \u00a347m (2021: credit of \u00a345m) which included \u00a357m (2021: \u00a393m) associated with initiatives to enable restructuring offset by \u00a310m (2021: \u00a3138m) released from the provision\n- 7 The Group has assessed the carrying value of its assets. Further details are provided in notes 9, 10, 11 and 12\n- 8 The effect of acquisition accounting includes the amortisation of intangible assets arising on previous acquisitions\n- 9 The past-service credit of \u00a322m includes a \u00a323m credit as a result of changes in the schemes in Power Systems, a settlement loss of \u00a37m on the Rolls-Royce North America retirement scheme and a credit of \u00a36m as a result of a constructive obligation recognised for the offering of the Bridging Pension Option (BPO) to other deferred members in the RRUKPF. Further details are provided in note 22\n- 10 Includes \u00a3(14)m (2021: \u00a314m) reclassification of amounts (received)/paid on interest rate swaps which are not designated as hedge relationship for accounting purposes from interest payable on an underlying basis to fair value movement\n- 11 Gains arising on the disposals of businesses are set out in note 27\n- 12 The 2021 tax credit relates to the increase in the UK tax rate from 19% to 25%\n- 13 The re-recognition of deferred tax assets relates to foreign exchange derivatives",

In 2021, this estimate was updated to reflect the actual cash settlement cost of \u00a31,674m and resulted in a \u00a315m gain to underlying finance costs in the year to 31 December 2021. The cash settlement costs of \u00a31,674m covers the period 2020-2026, \u00a3326m was incurred in the year to 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3452m, 2020: \u00a3186m). The Group estimates that future cash outflows of \u00a3389m will be incurred in 2023 and \u00a3321m spread over 2024-2026",

Advance corporation tax has no expiry.\n\nOf the total deferred tax asset of \u00a32,731m, \u00a32,183m (2021: \u00a31,736m) relates to the UK and is made up as follows:\n\n- -\u00a31,054m (2021: \u00a31,054m) relating to tax losses;\n- -\u00a3668m (2021: \u00a3339m) arising on unrealised losses on derivative contracts;\n- -\u00a3162m (2021: \u00a3162m) of advance corporation tax; and\n- -\u00a3299m (2021: \u00a3181m) relating to other deductible temporary differences, in particular tax depreciation and relief for interest expenses.\n\nThe UK deferred tax assets primarily arise in Rolls-Royce plc and have been recognised based on the expectation that the business will generate taxable profits and tax liabilities in the future against which the losses and deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nMost of the UK tax losses relate to the Civil Aerospace large engine business which makes initial losses through the investment period of a programme and then makes a profit through its contracts for services. The programme lifecycles are typically in excess of 30 years.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the assets can be utilised. A recoverability assessment has been undertaken, taking account of deferred tax liabilities against which the reversal can be offset and using latest UK forecasts, which are mainly driven by the Civil Aerospace large engine business, to assess the level of future taxable profits.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets has been assessed on the following basis:\n\n- -using the most recent UK profit forecasts which are consistent with past experience and external sources on market conditions. These forecasts cover the next five years;\n- -the long-term forecast profit profile of certain major large engine programmes which is typically in excess of 30 years from initial investment to retirement of the fleet, including the aftermarket revenues earned from airline customers;\n- -taking into account the risk that regulatory changes could materially impact demand for our products and shifting investment focus towards more sustainable products and solutions;\n- -consideration that all commercial aero-engines will be compatible with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023;\n- -a 25% probability of the severe but plausible downside forecast materialising in relation to the civil aviation industry; and\n- -the long-term forecast profit and cost profile of the other parts of the business.",

        "page_content": "## 5  Taxation - continued\n\nThe assessment takes into account UK tax laws that, in broad terms, restrict the offset of the carried forward tax losses to 50% of current year profits. In addition, management's assumptions relating to the amounts and timing of future taxable profits include the impact of macroeconomic factors and climate change on existing large engine programmes. Based on this assessment, the Group has recognised a total UK deferred tax asset of \u00a32,183m. This reflects the conclusions that:\n\n- -It is probable that the business will generate taxable income and tax liabilities in the future against which these losses can be utilised.\n- -Based on current forecasts and using various scenarios these losses and other deductible temporary differences will be used in full within the expected large engine programme lifecycles. An explanation of the potential impact of climate change on forecast profits and sensitivity analysis can be found in note 1.\n\nThe Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in respect of 2022 UK tax losses. This includes the impact of the IAS 37 amendment.\n\nThe other significant deferred tax asset arises in Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG, where the main activity is business aviation. The total net deferred tax asset is \u00a3284m (2021: \u00a3254m), which has been recognised in full. The deferred tax asset relates to revenue being recognised and taxed earlier under local tax rules resulting in a benefit when revenue is recognised in the accounts.\n\nAny future changes in tax law or the structure of the Group could have a significant effect on the use of losses and other deductible temporary differences, including the period over which they can be used. In view of this and the significant judgement involved the Board continuously reassesses this area.\n\nThe temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to \u00a31,062m (2021: \u00a3957m). No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Group is reviewing the impact of the OECD Pillar Two (global minimum tax) rules and the associated UK draft legislation, which was released on 20 July 2022. These rules will apply to the Group from 2024.",

These forecasts generally cover the next five years. Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on growth rates of 1% to 2% which reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate. Inflation has been included based on contractual commitments where relevant. Where general inflation assumptions have been required, these have been estimated based on externally sourced data. General inflation assumptions of 3% to 4% have been included in the forecasts, depending on the nature and geography of the flows.\n- -The key forecast assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and the cash flow projections, in particular the programme assumptions (such as sales volumes and product costs), the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs, and growth rates. Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.\n- -The Group believe there are significant business growth opportunities to come from Rolls-Royce playing a leading role in the transition to net zero, whilst at the same time climate change poses potentially significant risks. The assumptions used by the Directors are based on past experience and external sources of information. The main climate-related areas that have been considered are the risk that regulatory changes could materially impact demand for its products (and hence the utilisation of the products whilst in service and their useful lives) and shifting investment focus towards more sustainable products and solutions. Based on the climate scenarios prepared, the forecasts do not assume a significant deterioration of demand for Civil Aerospace (including Rolls-Royce Deutschland) programmes given that all commercial aero-engines will be compatible with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023. Similarly, the most popular reciprocating engines in Power Systems will be compatible with sustainable fuels by the end of 2023. The investment required to ensure our new products will be compatible with net zero operation by 2030, and to achieve net zero scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions is reflected in the forecasts used.\n\nA 1.5 o C scenario has been prepared using key data points from external sources including Oxford Economics, Global Climate Service and Databank and the International Energy Agency. This scenario has been used as the basis of a sensitivity. It is assumed that governments adopt stricter product and behavioural standards and measures that result in higher carbon pricing. Under these conditions it is assumed that markets are willing to pay for low carbon solutions and that there is an economic return from strategic investments in low carbon alternatives. The sensitivity has considered the likelihood of demand changes for our products based on their relative fuel efficiency in the marketplace and the probability of alternatives being introduced earlier than currently expected. The sensitivity also reflects the impact of a broad range of potential costs imposed by policy or regulatory interventions (through carbon pricing). This sensitivity does not indicate the need for an impairment charge.\n\nThe principal assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are:\n\n## Rolls-Royce Power Systems AG\n\n- -Recoverable amount represents FVLCOD to reflect the future strategy of the business. Whilst there are no indicators of impairment under the value in use method presented in 2021, the Directors consider that disclosing information prepared on a FVLCOD basis here is a more useful representation of the recoverable amount when considering the future strategy of the business, including the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities. Due to the unavailability of observable market inputs or inputs based on market evidence, the fair value is estimated by discounting future cash flows (Level 3 as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement ) modified for market participants views;\n- -Trading assumptions (e.g. volume of equipment deliveries, pricing achieved and cost escalation) that are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of market share and long-term economic forecasts;\n- -Severe but plausible downside scenario in relation to macro-economic factors included with a 20% weighting;\n- -Cash flows beyond the five-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 1.0% (2021: 2.0%); and\n- -Nominal post-tax discount rate 10.0% (2021: 8.2%).\n\nThe Directors do not consider that any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions (including taking consideration of the climate-related risks above) would cause the FVLCOD of the business to fall below its carrying value of goodwill.",

Remaining assets are amortised over a range of three to 20 years\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets allocated across multiple CGUs is not significant in comparison with the Group's total carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\n\nOther intangible assets (including programme intangible assets) have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. Assessments have considered potential triggers of impairment such as external factors, including climate change, significant changes with an adverse effect on a programme and by analysing latest management forecasts against those prepared in 2021 to identify any deterioration in performance.\n\nWhere a trigger event has been identified, an impairment test has been carried out. Where an impairment was required the test was performed on the following basis:\n\n- -The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use. These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by the Directors, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes; and\n- -The key assumptions underpinning cash flow projections are based on estimates of product performance related estimates, future market share and pricing and cost for uncontracted business. Climate-related risks are considered when making these estimates consistent with the assumptions above.\n\nThere have been no (2021: none) individually material impairment charges or reversals recognised during the year.",

Any excess amount, once the carrying value is reduced to nil, is recorded as deferred income\n- 4 The Group's investment in Airtanker Holdings Limited was classified as a non-current asset held for sale at 13 September 2021. Further detail can be found in note 27\n- 5 Up to 13 September 2021, when Airtanker Holdings Limited was transferred to held for sale, the Group recognised share of OCI relating to cash flow hedges of \u00a343m\n- 6 During the year, additions to investments of \u00a329m include the following significant transactions: On 20 June 2022, the Group acquired a 54% investment in Hoeller Electrolyzer. Although the Group has acquired a 54% stake, the Group has considered whether the majority stake constitutes a subsidiary as per the basis of consolidation on page 113 and 114. Based on key decisions requiring consent from both shareholders, the Group has concluded that Hoeller Electrolyser is jointly controlled and is equity accounted in the Consolidated Financial Statements. On 1 September 2022, the Group and Air China established a joint venture called Beijing Aero Engine Services Company Limited\n- 7 During the year, one of the Group's investments in its Civil Aerospace joint venture repair and overhaul facilities has been impaired by \u00a374m. This reflects the Directors' updated judgement of the recoverable amount from that investment when measured on a value in use basis by discounting expected future dividends at 12.4% cost of equity. The charge in the year reflects a higher discount rate and revised assumptions taking into account the impact of inflation and interest rates on that business, reflecting current market conditions\n\nReconciliation of share of retained (loss)/profit to the income statement and cash flow statement:\n\n|                                                                                    | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Share of results of joint ventures and associates                                  | 9         | 22        |\n| Adjustments for intercompany trading  1                                            | 39        | 23        |\n| Share of results of joint ventures and associates to the Group                     | 48        | 45        |\n| Dividends paid by joint ventures and associates to the Group (cash flow statement) | (73)      | (27)      |\n| Share of retained (loss)/profit attributable to continuing operations (above)      | (25)      | 18        |\n\n- 1 During the year, the Group sold spare engines to Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance, a joint venture and subsidiary of Alpha Partners Leasing Limited. The Group's share of the profit on these sales is deferred and released to match the depreciation of the engines in the joint venture's financial statements. In 2022 and 2021, profit deferred on the sale of engines was lower than the release of that deferred in prior years",

There were no impairment losses\n\nThe Group has adopted the simplified approach to provide for ECLs, measuring the loss allowance at a probability weighted amount incorporated by using credit ratings which are publicly available, or through internal risk assessments derived using the customer's latest available financial information.\n\nThe ECLs for trade receivables and other assets has increased by \u00a387m to \u00a3346m (2021: \u00a37m to \u00a3259m). This movement is mainly driven by the Civil Aerospace business of \u00a390m, of which \u00a383m relates to specific customers and \u00a37m relates to updates to the recoverability of other receivables.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs used for the estimation of the ECLs are disclosed in the table below:\n\n|                       | 2022                                               | 2022               | 2022                | 2021  1                                             | 2021  1            | 2021  1             |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n|                       | Trade  receivables  and other  financial assets \u00a3m | Loss  allowance \u00a3m | Average  ECL rate % | Trade  receivables  and other  financial  assets \u00a3m | Loss  allowance \u00a3m | Average  ECL rate % |\n| Investment grade  2   | 1,637                                              | (177)              | 11%                 | 1,296                                               | (68)               | 5%                  |\n| Non-investment grade  | 124                                                | (16)               | 13%                 | 48                                                  | (2)                | 4%                  |\n| Without credit rating | 3,507                                              | (153)              | 4%                  | 3,086                                               | (189)              | 6%                  |\n|                       | 5,268                                              | (346)              | 7%                  | 4,430                                               | (259)              | 6%                  |",

The decrease in the Civil Aerospace balance is due to collection of higher cash receipts than revenue recognised in relation to completion of performance obligations on those contracts with a contract asset balance. Revenue recognised relating to performance obligations satisfied in previous years was \u00a326m in Civil Aerospace. No impairment losses in relation to these contract assets (2021: none) have arisen during the year.\n\nParticipation fee contract assets have reduced by \u00a33m (2021: \u00a3188m) due to amortisation exceeding additions by \u00a37m, offset by foreign exchange on consolidation of \u00a34m.\n\nThe absolute value of ECLs for contract assets has increased by \u00a36m to \u00a321m (2021: \u00a315m).\n\n|                                               | Current   | Current   | Non-current   | Non-current   | Total   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|---------|---------|\n|                                               | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m       | 2021 \u00a3m       | 2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m |\n| Contract liabilities                          | 4,825     | 3,599     | 7,337         | 6,710         | 12,162  | 10,309  |\n| Contract liabilities are analysed as follows: |           |           |               |               |         |         |\n| Financial instruments (note 20)               |           |           |               |               | 420     | 264     |\n| Non-financial instruments                     |           |           |               |               | 11,742  | 10,045  |\n|                                               |           |           |               |               | 12,162  | 10,309  |\n\nDuring the year \u00a33,321m (2021: \u00a32,713m) of the opening contract liability was recognised as revenue.\n\nContract liabilities have increased by \u00a31,853m. The movement in the Group balance is as a result of increases in Civil Aerospace of \u00a31,395m and Defence of \u00a3324m. The main reason for the Civil Aerospace increase is a growth in LTSA liabilities of \u00a31,128m to \u00a38,257m (2021: \u00a37,129m) driven by growth in customer payments as engine flying hours continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and price escalation. There have also been additional buy-in fees received in relation to new contracts. This has been partly offset by revenue being recognised in relation to performance obligations satisfied in previous years of \u00a3334m as contract performance improves, which decreases the contract liability. An increase in Defence is from the receipt of deposits in advance of performance obligations being completed.",

Leases that have not yet commenced to which the Group is committed have a future liability of \u00a339m and consist of mainly plant and equipment and properties. The consolidated income statement shows the following amounts relating to leases:\n\n|                                                                                                                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Land and buildings depreciation and impairment  1                                                               | (41)      | (41)      |\n| Plant and equipment depreciation and impairment  2                                                              | (36)      | (24)      |\n| Aircraft and engines depreciation and impairment  3                                                             | (210)     | (192)     |\n| Total depreciation and impairment charge for right-of-use assets                                                | (287)     | (257)     |\n| Adjustment of amounts payable under residual value guarantees within lease liabilities  3, 4                    | 3         | 4         |\n| Expense relating to short-term leases of 12 months or less recognised as an expense on a straight line basis  2 | (28)      | (16)      |\n| Expense relating to variable lease payments not included in lease liabilities  3, 5                             | (2)       | (2)       |\n| Total operating costs                                                                                           | (314)     | (271)     |\n| Interest expense  6                                                                                             | (68)      | (63)      |\n| Total lease expense                                                                                             | (382)     | (334)     |\n| Income from sub-leasing right-of-use assets                                                                     | 32        | 35        |\n| Total amount recognised in the income statement                                                                 | (350)     | (299)     |\n\n- 1 Included in cost of sales and commercial and administration costs depending on the nature and the use of the right-of-use asset\n- 2 Included in cost of sales, commercial and administration costs, or research and development depending on the nature and use of the right-of-use asset\n\n- 4 Where the cost of meeting residual value guarantees is less than that previously estimated, as costs have been mitigated or liabilities waived by the lessor, the lease liability has been remeasured. Where the value of this remeasurement exceeds the value of the right-of use asset, the reduction in the lease liability is credited to cost of sales\n- 5 Variable lease payments primarily arise on a small number of contracts where engine lease payments are dependent upon utilisation rather than a periodic charge\n\nThe total cash outflow for leases in 2022 was \u00a3316m (2021: \u00a3448m). Of this, \u00a3286m related to leases reflected in the lease liability, \u00a328m to short-term leases where lease payments are expensed on a straight-line basis and \u00a32m for variable lease payments where obligations are only due when the assets are used. The timing difference between income statement charge and cash flow relates to costs incurred at the end of leases for residual value guarantees and restoration costs that are recognised within depreciation over the term of the lease, the most significant amounts relate to engine leases.\n\n## Leases as lessor\n\nThe Group acts as lessor for engines to Civil Aerospace customers when they require engines to support their fleets. Lease agreements with the lessees provide protection over the assets. Usage in excess of specified limits and damage to the engine while on lease are covered by variable lease payment structures. Lessee bankruptcy risk is managed through the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (including a specific protocol relating to aircraft equipment); an international treaty that creates common standards for the registration of lease contracts and establishes various legal remedies for default in financing agreements, including repossession and the effect of particular states' bankruptcy laws. Engines are only leased once the Group confirm that appropriate insurance documentation is established that covers the engine assets to pre-agreed amounts. All such contracts are operating leases. The Group also leases out a small number of properties, or parts of properties, where there is excess capacity under operating leases.\n\n|                                                                                  |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Operating lease income - credited within revenue from aftermarket services  1, 2 |        84 |        80 |\n\nTotal non-cancellable future operating lease rentals (undiscounted) of \u00a395m (2021: \u00a358m) are receivable over the next 12 years. \u00a312m (2021: \u00a39m) is due within one year, \u00a345m (2021: \u00a328m) between one to five years and \u00a338m (2021: \u00a321m) after five years.\n\nIn a limited number of circumstances, the Group sublets properties that are treated as a finance lease when the arrangement transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset. At 31 December 2022, the total undiscounted lease payments receivable is \u00a339m (2021: \u00a319m) on annual lease income of \u00a34m (2021: \u00a32m). The discounted finance lease receivable at 31 December 2022 is \u00a332m (2021: \u00a317m). There was nil (2021: nil) finance income recognised during the year.",

Industry average payment terms vary between 90-120 days. The Group offers reduced payment terms for smaller suppliers, so that they are paid in 30 days. In line with aerospace industry practice, the Group offers a SCF programme in partnership with banks to enable suppliers, including joint ventures, who are on standard 75-day payment terms to receive their payments sooner. The SCF programme is available to suppliers at their discretion and does not change rights and obligations with suppliers nor the timing of payment to suppliers. At 31 December 2022, suppliers had drawn \u00a3422m under the SCF scheme (2021: \u00a3540m).",

There have been no transfers during the year from or to Level 3 valuation. Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.\n\n- A These primarily comprise unconsolidated companies where fair value approximates to the book value. Listed investments are valued using Level 1 methodology\n- B Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months. Money market funds are valued using Level 1 methodology\n- C Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities and trade receivables held to collect or sell are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves. For commodity derivatives, forward commodity prices are used to determine expected future cash flows. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices (Level 2)\n- D Other assets are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices or latest forecast (Level 2/Level 3). At 31 December 2022, Level 3 assets totalled \u00a325m (2021: \u00a315m)\n- E Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of borrowings is estimated using quoted prices (Level 1)\n- F Borrowings are carried at amortised cost. Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. The fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting contractual future cash flows (Level 2)\n- G The fair value of lease liabilities are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or the Group's incremental cost of borrowing (Level 2)\n- H The fair value of RRSAs and other liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows. The contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts (Level 3)\n\nIFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement defines a three-level valuation hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 - quoted prices for similar instruments;\n\nLevel 2 - directly observable market inputs other than Level 1 inputs; and\n\nLevel 3 - inputs not based on observable market data.\n\n## Carrying values of other financial assets and liabilities\n\nForeign\n\n|                         | exchange  contracts \u00a3m   | Commodity  contracts \u00a3m   | Interest rate  contracts  1 \u00a3m   | Total  derivatives  \u00a3m   | Financial  RRSAs \u00a3m   | Other \u00a3m   | C Shares \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------------|------------|\n| 2022                    |                          |                           |                                  |                          |                       |            |               |            |\n| Non-current assets      | 58                       | 25                        | 436                              | 519                      | -                     | 23         | -             | 542        |\n| Current assets          | 87                       | 40                        | 2                                | 129                      | -                     | 12         | -             | 141        |\n| Assets                  | 145                      | 65                        | 438                              | 648                      | -                     | 35         | -             | 683        |\n| Current liabilities     | (966)                    | (1)                       | (2)                              | (969)                    | (8)                   | (15)       | (24)          | (1,016)    |\n| Non-current liabilities | (3,030)                  | (2)                       | (98)                             | (3,130)                  | (14)                  | (86)       | -             | (3,230)    |\n| Liabilities             | (3,996)                  | (3)                       | (100)                            | (4,099)                  | (22)                  | (101)      | (24)          | (4,246)    |\n|                         | (3,851)                  | 62                        | 338                              | (3,451)                  | (22)                  | (66)       | (24)          | (3,563)    |\n| 2021                    |                          |                           |                                  |                          |                       |            |               |            |\n| Non-current assets      | 159                      | 11                        | 176                              | 346                      | -                     | 15         | -             | 361        |\n| Current assets          | 12                       | 21                        | -                                | 33                       | -                     | 13         | -             | 46         |\n| Assets                  | 171                      | 32                        | 176                              | 379                      | -                     | 28         | -             | 407        |\n| Current liabilities     | (629)                    | -                         | -                                | (629)                    | (7)                   | (28)       | (25)          | (689)      |\n| Non-current liabilities | (2,581)                  | -                         | (82)                             | (2,663)                  | (5)                   | (47)       | -             | (2,715)    |\n| Liabilities             | (3,210)                  | -                         | (82)                             | (3,292)                  | (12)                  | (75)       | (25)          | (3,404)    |\n|                         | (3,039)                  | 32                        | 94                               | (2,913)                  | (12)                  | (47)       | (25)          | (2,997)    |\n\n- 1 Includes the foreign exchange impact of cross-currency interest rate swaps",

The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities (jet fuel and base metals). To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in a foreign currency, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value or cash flow hedges.

These contracts were designated as the hedging instrument in cash flow hedges with hedge ratio of 1:1. At inception, the existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is verified. Both the spot component and the contingent element were designated as the hedging instrument.\n\nAt deal completion, these contracts had a fair value of \u00a3(56)m, based on the weighted average foreign exchange rate of 1.1992. \u00a352m was reclassified to loss on disposal in the income statement from hedging reserves (\u00a362m from hedging reserve and \u00a3(10)m from cost of hedging reserve). There was ineffectiveness of \u00a34m recognised in net financing during the year. The forward element and basis were excluded from the hedging instrument designation and separately accounted for in the equity reserve for cost of hedging.\n\nThe impact of cash flow hedges on the financial position and performance of the Group is as follows:\n\n|                     | Hedged item   | Hedged item                     | Hedging instrument  1   | Hedging instrument  1                   | Hedging instrument  1           | Hedging instrument  1                        | Hedging instrument  1      | Hedging instrument  1             | Hedging reserves              | Hedging reserves               | Hedging reserves                      |\n|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                     | Nominal \u00a3m    | FV  movement  in the  period \u00a3m | Nominal \u00a3m              | Carrying  amount  asset/ (liability) \u00a3m | FV  movement  in the  period \u00a3m | Hedge  ineffect- iveness  in the  period  \u00a3m | Weighted  average  FX rate | Weighted  average  interest  rate | Amount  recognised  in OCI \u00a3m | Recycled  to net  financing \u00a3m | Closing  cash flow  hedge  reserve \u00a3m |\n| At 31 December 2022 |               |                                 |                         |                                         |                                 |                                              |                            |                                   |                               |                                |                                       |\n| USD                 | (772)         | (104)                           | 772                     | 89                                      | 109                             | 5                                            | 1.29                       | 5.33                              | (111)                         | 96                             | (25)                                  |\n| Euro                | (677)         | (35)                            | 677                     | (2)                                     | 35                              | -                                            | 1.11                       | 5.45                              | (27)                          | 28                             | (9)                                   |\n| At 31 December 2021 |               |                                 |                         |                                         |                                 |                                              |                            |                                   |                               |                                |                                       |\n| USD                 | (772)         | (35)                            | 772                     | (20)                                    | 35                              | -                                            | 1.29                       | 5.33                              | (36)                          | 10                             | (10)                                  |\n| Euro                | (677)         | 32                              | 677                     | (37)                                    | (32)                            | (1)                                          | 1.11                       | 5.45                              | 39                            | (51)                           | (10)                                  |\n\n- 1 Hedging instruments are included in other financial assets or liabilities in the balance sheet",

The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk - The Group has significant cash flows (most significantly USD, followed by the euro) denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity. To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.\n\nDuring the year, the Board approved a revised FX hedging policy reducing the time horizon from 10 years to 5 years. The Group economically hedges its GBP/USD exposure by forecasting highly probable net USD receipts up to five years forward. Hedges are taken out within prescribed maximum and minimum hedge positions set out in the Group FX Policy. Transition of the existing hedge book to the levels stated with the new policy will be completed in the near term. The maximum and minimum policy bands decline gradually over the five-year horizon and are calculated as a percentage of forecast net income. A similar policy is operated for the Group's EUR/USD exposure. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated in hedging relationships.\n\nThe Group also has exposures to cash flows on EUR and USD denominated fixed rate borrowings. To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, the Group has entered into fixed-to-fixed cross-currency interest rate swaps, which, for accounting purposes, are designated as cash flow hedges. The swaps have similar critical terms to the hedged items, such as the initial exchange amounts, payment dates and maturities. Therefore, there is an economic relationship and the hedge ratio is established as 1:1. Possible sources of ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedge relationship are changes in the credit risk of either party to the interest rate swap. Another possible source of ineffectiveness would be if the notional of the borrowings is less than the notional of the derivative, for example, in the event of a partial repayment of hedged debt prior to its maturity.\n\nThe Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments. The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.\n\nLiquidity risk - The Group's policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities. The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which, together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.\n\nCredit risk - The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments. The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Group's risk management activities. The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures. Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy. The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Group's exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with 'BBB' or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution. At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties. The Group's revenue is generated from customers located across multiple geographical locations (see note 2). These customers are typically: airframers and airline operators relating to Civil Aerospace; government defence departments for the UK and US; and multiple smaller entities for Power Systems. Whilst there are a limited number of customers related to Civil Aerospace and Defence, they are spread across various geographical locations. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.\n\nInterest rate risk - The Group's interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings (fair value risk), floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents (cash flow risk). Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile of the Group. The fixed or floating rate interest rate decision on long-term borrowings is determined for each new agreement at the point it is entered into. The aggregate interest rate position of the Group is reviewed regularly and can be revised at any time in order to react to changes in market conditions or circumstances.\n\nThe Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments such as EUR, GBP and USD fixed rate borrowings. To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group has entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps, which, for accounting purposes, are designated as fair value hedges. The swaps have similar critical terms to the hedged items, such as the reference rate, reset dates, notional amounts, payment dates and maturities. Therefore, there is an economic relationship and the hedge ratio is established as 1:1. Possible sources of ineffectiveness in the fair value hedge relationship are changes in the credit risk of either party to the interest rate swap and, for cross-currency interest rate swaps, the cross-currency basis risk as this risk is present in the hedging instrument only. Another possible source of ineffectiveness would be if the notional of the borrowings is less than the notional of the derivative, for example in the event of a partial repayment of hedged debt prior to its maturity.\n\nThe Group has exposure to changes in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. To manage this risk the Group has entered into floatingto-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge a proportion of its floating rate exposure to fixed rates. The swaps have similar critical terms to the floating leg of swaps that form part of the fair value hedges, such as the reference rate, reset dates, notional amounts, payment dates and maturities. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are generally not designated as hedging instruments.\n\nCommodity price risk - The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations. To minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions. The commodity hedging policy is similar to the Group FX policy, in that the Group forecasts highly probable exposures to commodities, and takes out hedges within prescribed maximum and minimum levels as set out in the policy. The maximum and minimum policy bands decline gradually over time. For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are generally not designated in hedging relationships.\n\nOther price risk - The Group's cash equivalent balances represent investments in money-market instruments, with a term of up to three months. The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.",

The Group has several contractual cures available in the event the stipulated loan-to-value ratio is exceeded. Failure by the Group to satisfy its contractual obligations under the covenant gives rights to the lessor to terminate its lease and claim termination amounts for the outstanding lease balance.

C Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year. Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash. Any C Shares retained attract a dividend of Bank of England base rate on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights. The Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.\n\nMovements in issued and fully paid C Shares during the year were as follows:\n\n|                | 2022     | 2022             | 2021     | 2021             |\n|----------------|----------|------------------|----------|------------------|\n|                | Millions | Nominal value \u00a3m | Millions | Nominal value \u00a3m |\n| At 1 January   | 24,928   | 25               | 27,540   | 28               |\n| Redeemed       | (1,073)  | (1)              | (2,612)  | (3)              |\n| At 31 December | 23,855   | 24               | 24,928   | 25               |\n\nPayments to shareholders represent the value of C Shares to be issued in respect of the results for the year.

As a result of the amendment to IAS 37 for Onerous Contracts, from 1 January 2022 provisions for contract losses have been measured on a fully costed basis resulting in a \u00a3723m increase of the total contract loss provision as at 1 January 2022 (see note 1 for details). During the year, additional contract losses for the Group of \u00a3520m have been recognised as a result of changes in future cost estimates, primarily in relation to LTSA shop visits, exchange rate movements and also includes \u00a3157m which arose from the sale of ITP Aero resulting in the recognition of additional costs which were previously eliminated on consolidation. Contract losses of \u00a3395m previously recognised have been reversed following improvements to cost estimates across various large engine programmes as a result of operational improvements and updates to the discount rate. The Group continues to monitor the contract loss provision for changes in the market and revises the provision as required. The value of the remaining contract loss provisions reflect, in each case, the single most likely outcome. The provisions are expected to be utilised over the term of the customer contracts, typically within 8 to 16 years.\n\n## Warranty and guarantees\n\nProvisions for warranty and guarantees primarily relate to products sold and are calculated based on an assessment of the remediation costs related to future claims based on past experience. The provision generally covers a period of up to three years.\n\n## Trent 1000 wastage costs\n\nIn November 2019, the Group announced the outcome of testing and a thorough technical and financial review of the Trent 1000 TEN programme, following technical issues which were identified in 2019, resulting in a revised timeline and a more conservative estimate of durability for the improved HP turbine blade for the TEN variant. During the year, the Group has utilised \u00a384m of the Trent 1000 wastage costs provision. This represents customer disruption costs and remediation shop visit costs. During the year, additional Trent 1000 costs of \u00a3106m relating to wastage have been recognised reflecting delays in certification which have led to revised cost and timing estimates. The value of the remaining provision reflects the single most likely outcome and is expected to be utilised over the period 2023-2024.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe Group's captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group, which include policies for aviation claims, employer liabilities and healthcare claims. Significant delays can occur in the notification and settlement of claims, and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date. The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however, it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary if the frequency or severity of claims differs from estimated. Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.\n\n## Employer liability claims\n\nThe provision relating to employer healthcare liability claims is as a result of an historical insolvency of the previous provider and is expected to be utilised over the next 30 years.\n\n## Customer financing\n\nCustomer financing provisions are made to cover guarantees provided for asset value and/or financing where it is probable that a payment will be made. These are reported on a discounted basis at the Group's borrowing rate to better reflect the time span over which these exposures could arise. The values of aircraft providing security are based on advice from a specialist aircraft appraiser. There were no provisions for Customer financing provisions at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a317m). The Group has contingent liabilities for customer financing arrangements where the payment is not probable. See note 25.",

        "page_content": "## 21  Provisions for liabilities and charges - continued\n\n## Tax related interest and penalties\n\nProvisions for tax related interest and penalties relate to uncertain tax positions in some of the jurisdictions in which the Group operates. Utilisation of the provisions will depend on the timing of resolution of the issues with the relevant tax authorities.\n\n## Other\n\nDuring the year, \u00a347m of other provisions have been charged to the income statement. The items that make up the charge in the year are individually immaterial and predominately relate to claims. At 31 December 2022, other provisions includes those items, as well as others (predominantly supplier claims), where the related legal proceedings are ongoing and utilisation will depend upon their resolution. The value of the provision reflects the single most likely outcome in each case.\n\n## 22  Post-retirement benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes:\n\n- -The UK defined benefit scheme is funded, with the assets held in a separate UK trust. The scheme closed to future accrual on 31 December 2020 for all active members and there are no new defined benefit accruals in the UK scheme. As at 31 December 2022 the scheme was estimated to be funded at 109% on the Technical Provisions basis.\n- -The Group also operates a large trust-based defined contribution scheme for current employees in the UK (RRRST). Pension contributions are generally paid as a salary sacrifice under which employees agree to a reduction in gross contractual pay in return for the Group making additional pension contributions on their behalf. As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of \u00a346m (2021: \u00a345m) in the year.\n- -Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans and provide benefits in line with local practice. Additionally, in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Group's employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees. These healthcare schemes are unfunded.\n\nThe valuations of the defined benefit schemes are based on the results of the most recent funding valuation, where relevant, updated by the scheme actuaries to 31 December 2022.\n\n## Changes to the defined benefit scheme\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, a constructive obligation has been recognised for the extension of the Bridging Pension Option (BPO) to other deferred members in RRUKPF. As a result, a past service credit of \u00a36m has been recognised within non-underlying operating profit.\n\nThe Rolls-Royce North America salaried plan was closed to future accruals in 2021. On 1 December 2022, the remaining assets and liabilities were transferred to Legal and General America Group as a bulk annuity purchase and were derecognised from the balance sheet. This resulted in a settlement loss of \u00a37m.\n\nDuring the year, Power Systems replaced a number of their existing defined benefit schemes with a new company pension scheme to offer payment options at time of retirement. The new system, which is similar in structure to a defined contribution scheme with a guarantee from the Company in accordance with German legislation, significantly reduces interest risks and longevity risks for the employer for future commitments. Invested assets for the scheme will be managed by Swiss Life. A past service credit of \u00a323m has been recognised within non-underlying operating profit.",

The rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.\n\nThe inflation assumption is determined by the market-implied assumption based on the yields on long-term index-linked government securities.\n\nThe mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAPS S3 'All' actuarial tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI 2021 core projections updated to reflect use of an 'A' parameter of 0.25% for future improvements and long-term improvements of 1.25%. Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take account of the scheme's actual experience.\n\nThe assumption for transfers and the BPO is based on actual experience and actuarial advice.\n\nOther assumptions have been set on advice from the actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and the assumptions used in the most recent funding valuation. The rate of increase of pensions in payment is based on the rules of the scheme, combined with the inflation assumption where the increase is capped.",

The maximum exposure (notional value and accrued returns) on the portfolios was \u00a3344m (2021: \u00a3550m)\n\nThe investment strategy for the UK scheme is controlled by the Trustee in consultation with the Group. The scheme assets do not directly include any of the Group's own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group. At 31 December 2022, there was no indirect holding of the Group's financial instruments (2021: none).\n\nThe liquidity of the UK scheme was not significantly impacted by the rapid rise in UK Government bond yields in the second half of 2022. The UK scheme (and its predecessor schemes) benefited from prudent cash funding from the Group in previous financial years coupled with long-term liability hedging programmes. These factors have resulted in the scheme being relatively well funded and consequently enabled it to keep leverage relatively low. Throughout 2022, the UK scheme maintained adequate levels of liquidity and eligible collateral to service its leveraged positions.\n\n## Future contributions\n\nThe Group expects to contribute approximately \u00a370m to its overseas defined benefit schemes in 2023 (2022: \u00a366m).\n\nIn the UK, any cash funding of RRUKPF is based on a statutory triennial funding valuation process. The Group and the Trustee negotiate and agree the actuarial assumptions used to value the liabilities (Technical Provisions); assumptions which may differ from those used for accounting set out above. The assumptions used to value Technical Provisions must be prudent rather than a best estimate of the liability. Most notably, the Technical Provision discount rate is currently based upon UK Government yields plus a margin (0.5% at the 31 March 2020 valuation) rather than being based on yields of AA corporate bonds. Once each valuation is signed, a Schedule of Contributions (SoC) must be agreed which sets out the cash contributions to be paid. The most recent valuation, as at 31 March 2020, agreed by the Trustee in June 2021, showed that RRUKPF was estimated to be 105% funded on the Technical Provisions basis (estimated to be 109% at 31 December 2022). All cash due has been paid in full and the current SoC does not require any cash contributions to be made by the Group. The current SoC does include an agreement for contributions between 2024 to 2027 (capped at \u00a3145m in total) if the Technical Provisions funding position is below 107% at 31 March 2023.",

The following table summarises how the estimated impact of a change in a significant assumption would affect the UK defined benefit obligation at 31 December 2022, while holding all other assumptions constant. This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nFor the most significant funded schemes, the investment strategies hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation measured on a proxy solvency basis.\n\nFor the UK scheme, the interest rate and inflation hedging is currently based on UK Government bond yields without any adjustment for any credit spread. The sensitivity analysis set out below have been determined based on a method that estimates the impact on the defined benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period.\n\n|                                             |                             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reduction in the discount rate of 0.25%  1  | Obligation                  | (205)     | (460)     |\n|                                             | Plan assets (LDI portfolio) | 235       | 484       |\n| Increase in inflation of 0.25%  1           | Obligation                  | (70)      | (210)     |\n|                                             | Plan assets (LDI portfolio) | 91        | 147       |\n| Increase of 1% in transfer value assumption | Obligations                 | (30)      | (55)      |\n| Increase of 5% of transfers instead of BPO  | Obligations                 | (5)       | (30)      |\n| One year increase in life expectancy        | Obligations                 | (165)     | (365)     |\n\n## 23  Share capital\n\n|                       | Non-equity          | Non-equity       | Equity                                | Equity           |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------|\n|                       | Special Share of \u00a31 | Nominal value \u00a3m | Ordinary  shares of 20p each Millions | Nominal value \u00a3m |\n| Issued and fully paid |                     |                  |                                       |                  |\n| At 1 January 2021     | 1                   | -                | 8,368                                 | 1,674            |\n| At 31 December 2021   | 1                   | -                | 8,368                                 | 1,674            |\n| At 31 December 2022   | 1                   | -                | 8,368                                 | 1,674            |\n\nThe rights attaching to each class of share are set out on page 207.\n\nIn accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation , the Company's non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) are classified as financial liabilities.

The closing price at 31 December 2022 was 93p (2021: 123p).\n\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options as at 31 December 2022 was two years (2021: two years) and the range of exercise prices for the share options as at 31 December 2022 was 97p to 261p.\n\n## Fair values of share-based payment plans\n\nThe weighted average fair value per share of equity-settled share-based payment plans granted during the year, estimated at the date of grant, are as follows:\n\n|                              | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| LTIP                         | 90p    | 104p   |\n| ShareSave - three year grant | n/a    | 67p    |\n| DSBP                         | 91p    | 105p   |\n\n## Long-term incentive plans (LTIP)\n\nThe fair value of shares awarded is calculated using a pricing model that takes account of the non-entitlement to dividends (or equivalent) during the vesting period and the market-based performance condition based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting. This adjustment decreases the fair value of the award relative to the share price at the date of grant.\n\n## ShareSave\n\nThe fair value of the options granted is calculated using a pricing model that assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six-month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price. Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term. This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.\n\n## Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)\n\nThe fair value of shares awarded under DSBP is calculated as the share price on the date of the award, excluding expected dividends (or equivalent).",

        "page_content": "## 25  Contingent liabilities\n\nIn January 2017, after full cooperation, the Company concluded deferred prosecution agreements (DPA) with the SFO and the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and a leniency agreement with the MPF, the Brazilian federal prosecutors. The terms of both DPAs have now expired. The Company continues to co-operate with the Controller General, Brazil (CGU) under the terms of a two-year leniency agreement signed in October 2021 relating to the same historical matters. Certain authorities are investigating members of the Group for matters relating to misconduct in relation to historical matters. The Group is responding appropriately. Action may be taken by further authorities against the Company or individuals. In addition, the Group could still be affected by actions from other parties, including customers, customers' financiers and the Company's current and former investors, including certain potential claims in respect of the Group's historical ethics and compliance disclosures which have been notified to the Company. The Directors are not currently aware of any matters that are likely to lead to a material financial loss over and above the penalties imposed to date, but cannot anticipate all the possible actions that may be taken or their potential consequences.\n\nContingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, commitments made for future service demand in respect of maintenance, repair and overhaul, and performance and reliability. The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items. Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims (including with tax authorities) which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts. As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Group's UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.\n\nIn connection with the sale of its products, the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers, generally in respect of civil aircraft. The Group's commitments relating to these financing arrangements are spread over many years, relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio and are generally secured on the asset subject to the financing. These include commitments of $1.2bn (2021: $1.7bn) (on a discounted basis) to provide facilities to enable customers to purchase aircraft (of which approximately $0.9bn could be called during 2023). These facilities may only be used if the customer is unable to obtain financing elsewhere and are priced at a premium to the market rate. Significant events impacting the international aircraft financing market, the failure by customers to meet their obligations under such financing agreements, or inadequate provisions for customer financing liabilities may adversely affect the Group's financial position.\n\nThe Group has responded appropriately to the Russia-Ukraine conflict to comply with international sanctions and export control regime, and also to implement our business decision to exit from Russia. The Group could be subject to action by impacted customers and other contract parties.\n\nWhile the outcome of the above matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the Directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.\n\n| 26  Related party transactions                               |         |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                              | 2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m |\n| Sales of goods and services  1                               | 5,074   | 3,548   |\n| Purchases of goods and services  1                           | (4,915) | (3,677) |\n| Lease payments to joint ventures and associates              | (163)   | (225)   |\n| Guarantees of joint arrangements' and associates' borrowings | 3       | 1       |\n| Guarantees of non-wholly owned subsidiaries' borrowings      | 3       | 3       |\n| Dividends received from joint ventures and associates        | 73      | 27      |\n| Other income received from joint ventures and associates     | 2       | 3       |\n\nIncluded in sales of goods and services to related parties are sales of spare engines amounting to \u00a319m (2021: \u00a3157m).

In accordance with IFRS 5, the Group had classified \u00a347m of the assets as held for sale at 31 December 2021. The sale completed on 9 February 2022 for a value of \u00a3189m. On disposal, the Group has recycled the Group's share of cash flow hedge reserve through the income statement during the year.\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Group signed an agreement for the sale of ITP Aero to Bain Capital for \u00a31.3bn. In accordance with IFRS 5, at 31 December 2021, the Group classified the net assets of the ITP Aero disposal group of \u00a31.2bn as held for sale. The sale completed on 15 September 2022 for a value of \u00a31.3bn. On disposal, the Group recycled the Group's share of hedging reserves and the cumulative currency translation reserve through the income statement. In addition, as part of the disposal, costs have been recognised in loss on disposal for continuing obligations (\u00a3157m), in particular where previous amounts were eliminated on consolidation in the Group's results. ITP Aero was acquired in 2017, resulting in a gain on bargain purchase of \u00a3303m recognised in 2018. The consideration for the acquisition was settled by issue of shares and the premium on the share issues, of \u00a3650m, recognised as merger reserve. As a result of the sale of ITP Aero for qualifying consideration, the merger reserve arising has been realised in accumulated losses.\n\n|                                                                     | ITP Aero -  Total subsidiaries \u00a3m   | Airtanker \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| Proceeds                                                            |                                     |                |            |\n| Cash consideration at prevailing exchange rate                      | 1,387                               | 189            | 1,576      |\n| Impact of deal contingent forward                                   | (52)                                | -              | (52)       |\n| Cash consideration at effective hedged rate                         | 1,335                               | 189            | 1,524      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents disposed                                  | (60)                                | -              | (60)       |\n| Net cash consideration                                              | 1,275                               | 189            | 1,464      |\n| Intangible assets                                                   | 912                                 | -              | 912        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                       | 338                                 | -              | 338        |\n| Right-of-use assets                                                 | 13                                  | -              | 13         |\n| Investments                                                         | 1                                   | 34             | 35         |\n| Deferred tax assets                                                 | 57                                  | -              | 57         |\n| Inventory                                                           | 283                                 | -              | 283        |\n| Trade receivables and other assets  1                               | 768                                 | 14             | 782        |\n| Borrowings and lease liabilities                                    | (53)                                | -              | (53)       |\n| Trade payables and other liabilities  1                             | (1,148)                             | -              | (1,148)    |\n| Provisions for liabilities and charges                              | (22)                                | -              | (22)       |\n| Less: Net assets disposed                                           | 1,149                               | 48             | 1,197      |\n| Profit on disposal before disposal costs and accounting adjustments | 126                                 | 141            | 267        |\n| Disposal costs                                                      | (33)                                | (3)            | (36)       |\n| De-recognition of NCI                                               | (1)                                 | -              | (1)        |\n| Cumulative currency translation loss                                | (65)                                | -              | (65)       |\n| Cumulative hedging reserves loss                                    | (49)                                | (62)           | (111)      |\n| Impact of disposal on consolidated position of onerous contracts  2 | (157)                               | -              | (157)      |\n| (Loss)/profit before taxation                                       | (179)                               | 76             | (103)      |\n| Tax on disposal                                                     | 31                                  | -              | 31         |\n| (Loss)/profit on disposal of business after taxation                | (148)                               | 76             | (72)       |",

All comparative figures remain unchanged versus those reported in the 2021 Annual Report.\n\nFree cash flow is a measure of financial performance of the business' cash flow to see what is available for distribution among those stakeholders funding the business (including debt holders and shareholders). Free cash flow is calculated as trading cash flow less recurring tax and post-employment benefit expenses. It excludes payments made to shareholders, amounts spent (or received) on business acquisitions or disposals, financial penalties paid and foreign exchange changes on net funds. The Board considers that free cash flow reflects cash generated from the Group's underlying trading.\n\nCash flow from operating activities is determined to be the nearest statutory measure to free cash flow. The reconciliation between free cash flow and cash flow from operating activities can be found on page 205.",

After due consideration, the Directors consider that the Group has sufficient liquidity headroom to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 18 months from the date of this report and there are no material uncertainties that may cast doubt on the Company's going concern status, accordingly they are satisfied that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the Company Financial Statements.\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the UK (UK-adopted international accounting standards), but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006 and to take advantage of FRS 101 disclosure exemptions:\n\n- -a cash flow statement and related notes;\n- -comparative period reconciliation for investments and financial liabilities;\n- -comparative period reconciliation for share capital;\n- -the effects of new, but not yet effective accounting standards; and\n- -the requirements of IAS 24 Related Party Transactions and has, therefore, not disclosed transactions between the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\nThe accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Financial Statements.\n\nThere were no changes to accounting standards that had a material impact on these Financial Statements.\n\nThe Company's Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Company's functional currency.\n\nAs permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate income statement for the Company has not been included in these Financial Statements. As permitted by the audit fee disclosure regulations, disclosure of non-audit fees information is not included in respect of the Company.\n\n## Key areas of judgement and sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the Directors to exercise their judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The Directors have not identified any critical estimates, apart from the carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings, where there is a significant risk of material change in the next 12 months at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Key source of estimation uncertainty - carrying value of investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\nThe carrying value of the investment in subsidiary undertakings is reviewed for indicators of impairment on an annual basis. Where such indicators are present, a quantified impairment test would be required and the value in use calculated based upon a discounted cash flow methodology using the most recent forecasts prepared by the Directors of the Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Group. At 31 December 2022, the Directors identified indicators of impairment and performed a quantified impairment test. As part of this assessment, the Directors considered the areas of estimation uncertainty discussed in note 2. As a result of this, no impairment was required.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\n## Investments in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments included in fixed assets are investments in subsidiary companies and these are held at historical cost less impairments which is considered annually by the Directors.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are recognised initially at the transaction price. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The Company applies the IFRS 9 Financial Instruments simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables.",

Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. The cost of issuing ordinary shares are charged to the share premium account.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nAs described in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 77 to 95, the Company grants awards of its own shares to employees of its subsidiary undertakings (see note 24 of the Consolidated Financial Statements). The costs of share-based payments in respect of these awards are accounted for, by the Company, as an additional investment in its subsidiary undertakings. The costs are determined in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment . Any payments made by the subsidiary undertakings in respect of these arrangements are treated as a return of this investment.\n\n| 2  Investments - subsidiary undertakings                                                                                                      |        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Cost:                                                                                                                                         |        |\n| At 1 January 2022                                                                                                                             | 14,716 |\n| Cost of share-based payments in respect of employees of subsidiary undertakings less receipts from subsidiaries in  respect of those payments | 46     |\n| At 31 December 2022                                                                                                                           | 14,762 |\n\nDetails of the Company's subsidiary undertakings and joint venture and associates undertakings are listed on pages 179 to 184.\n\nThe carrying value of the Company's investments in subsidiary undertakings has been reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. The carrying value is compared to the asset's recoverable amount and has been assessed by reference to value in use. The value in use has been calculated based upon a discounted cash flow methodology using the most recent forecasts prepared and considered by the Directors of the Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Group. These forecasts:\n\n- -are consistent with past experience and external sources on market conditions;\n- -cover the next five years for each business together with a terminal value. The growth rate used within the terminal value reflects average growth of 1%-2% based on inflation forecasts by recognised bodies and also utilises long-term cash flow forecasts specific to each of the businesses. These reflect the best estimate of the impact of macro-economic factors and estimated cash flows from each major product line; and\n- -reflect estimation uncertainty through the use of a probability downside scenario for the businesses. These assumptions are consistent with those set out in the Going Concern Statement on page 48. The weighting applied is 75%-80% to a base case and 20%-25% to a downside scenario.\n\nManagement estimates nominal discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the rate of return a market participant would require. The rates used to discount the forecast cash flows reflects the individual businesses in the Group and is 11.6% to 13.7% pre-tax. An increase in the pre-tax discount rate of 1.6% would cause the carrying amount of the Company's investment to equal its recoverable amount.\n\nThe key assumptions for the value in use calculation are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates and foreign exchange. When making these considerations, the Group has also assessed the impact of climate change by considering the potential impact of carbon prices, commodity prices and aviation demand on the value in use under a 1.5\u00baC and 3.6\u00baC aligned scenario, based on specific pathway assumptions. The assumptions are consistent with those detailed in note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a stress test, the potential impact of the full scenario occurring has been evaluated and it would not result in an impairment.\n\nAs a result of this analysis, the Directors have determined that no impairment charge is required.",

The Company is a holding company and does not trade in its own right. The Company was incorporated in 2011 and became the Rolls-Royce Holdings company through a Scheme of Arrangement. On becoming the Rolls-Royce Holdings company, the value of the Company's investment in subsidiaries was based on the market capitalisation of the Rolls-Royce Group at that time. There was an increase in the investment as a result of a capital injection to Rolls-Royce Group Limited during 2020. The Group's consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis except where UK adopted international accounting standards requires a valuation basis to be applied (see page 175 for further details). As different principles are applied in preparing the Company and consolidated group balance sheets there is a difference in the financial position reported. Examples of such differences include the following items that are in the Consolidated balance sheet but not reflected in the Company's balance sheet: liabilities of \u00a310,681m (2021: \u00a38,836m) as a result of IFRS 15; and financial liabilities of \u00a33,851m (2021: \u00a33,039m) arising from the recognition at fair value of foreign exchange derivatives held to manage exposure on the Group's future trading.\n\n## 8  Contingent liabilities\n\nWhere the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, these guarantee contracts are considered to be contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, these guarantees amounted to \u00a39,724m (2021: \u00a310,458m) of which total drawn is \u00a34,224m (2021: \u00a35,958m).\n\nFor further details on action related to historical matters that could have an impact on the Company, see page 169.\n\n## 9  Other information\n\n## Employees\n\nThe Company had no employees in 2022 (2021: none).\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nShares in the Company have been granted to employees of the Group as part of share-based payment plans, and are charged in the employing company.\n\n## Emoluments of Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Directors of the Company is shown below, further information is in the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 77 to 95.\n\nThe total amount of remuneration paid to Directors for the year ended 31 December 2022 was \u00a37,577,000 (2021: \u00a36,920,000). \u00a33,718,000 of this was attributed to the highest paid Director (2021: \u00a33,840,000). A cash allowance in lieu of company contributions to a pensions scheme was also paid to two Directors (2021: three), which totalled \u00a3199,000 (2021: \u00a3185,000). No Directors exercised share options during the year (2021: none) nor received vested shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan (2021: none).\n\nNo Director accrued any retirement benefits in the year (2021: none).",

        "page_content": "## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- -Rolls-Royce Holdings plc's consolidated financial statements and company financial statements (the 'financial statements') give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the company's affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the group's loss and the group's cash flows for the year then ended;\n- -the consolidated financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006;\n- -the company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework', and applicable law); and\n- -the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nWe have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the consolidated and company balance sheets as at 31 December 2022; the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated and company statements of changes in equity for the year then ended; and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.\n\nOur opinion is consistent with our reporting to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe remained independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC's Ethical Standard, as applicable to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, we declare that non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided.\n\nOther than those disclosed in note 7, we have provided no non-audit services to the company or its controlled undertakings in the period under audit.\n\n## Our audit approach\n\n## Overview\n\nAudit scope\n\n- -Following our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, including the impact of climate change, we subjected 33 individual components (including three joint ventures) to full scope audits for group purposes, which following an element of sub-consolidation, equates to 16 group reporting opinions. In addition, nine components performed targeted specified procedures.\n- -In addition, the group engagement team audited the company and other centralised functions including those covering the group treasury operations, corporate costs, corporate taxation, post-retirement benefits, and certain goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments. The group engagement team performed audit procedures over the group consolidation and financial statements disclosures and performed group level analytical procedures over out of scope components.\n- -The components on which full scope audits, targeted specified procedures and centralised work was performed accounted for 98% of revenue, 79% of loss before tax from continuing operations and 90% of total assets.\n- -Central audit testing was performed where appropriate for reporting components in group audit scope who are supported by the group's Finance Service Centres (FSCs).\n- -As part of the group audit supervision process, the group engagement team has performed 16 file reviews, which included meetings on approach and conclusions with the component teams and review of their audit files and final deliverables. In person site visits to components in the UK, Germany and US were also performed.\n\n## I N D E P E N D E N T   A U D I T O R S '   R E P O R T INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ROLLS-ROYCE HOLDINGS PLC\n\n## Report on the audit of the financial statements",

These long-term contracts require a number of assumptions to be made in order to determine the expected lifetime revenue and costs of the contract  and  the  amounts  of  revenue  and  profit/loss  that  is recognised in each reporting period.\n\nSmall adjustments can have a significant impact on the results of an individual  financial  year.  Changes  to  the  profile  of  shop  visits  or operating conditions of engines can result in different performance assumptions  and  hence  cost  profiles.  Some  contracts  include inflation  linked  price  escalations  which  require  judgement  to determine  the  extent  to  which  future  price  increases  are  highly probable not to reverse and therefore can be recognised. These changes to forecasts can result in revisions to the revenue previously recognised. \u00a3367m of such revisions has been recognised in the current year, increasing revenue.\n\nFor Defence, long-term contracts tend to be for a fixed price or based on a cost plus or target cost reimbursement for qualifying costs and there are also some flying hours arrangements. For Civil Aerospace aftermarket contracts, cash is earned based on engine flying hours, which requires management to estimate future engine flying hours (EFH) in order to arrive at the total income expected over the life of a contract. There remains significant uncertainty over the speed and shape of recovery in EFH for large engines. The group expects EFH to recover to pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024.\n\nIn addition, the profitability of Civil Aerospace aftermarket contracts typically assumes that there will be significant cost improvements over the lifetime (15-25 years) of the contracts. Significant judgement needs  to  be  applied  in  determining  time-on-wing,  whether incremental costs should be treated as wastage or are part of the ongoing cost of servicing a contract, future exchange rates used to translate foreign currency income and costs and other operating parameters used to calculate the projected life cycle. These future costs are also risk adjusted to take into account forecasting accuracy which represents an additional judgement.\n\nAt the development stage of a programme, agreements are entered into with certain Civil suppliers to share in the risk and rewards of the contracts (Risk and Revenue Sharing Partners - 'RRSP'). This can involve upfront participation fees from the RRSP that are amortised over the engine production phase. In addition, specified revenue and costs are recorded in the consolidated income statement net of the RRSP's share.\n\nThe nature of the Civil Aerospace business gives rise to a number of contractual guarantees, warranties and potential claims, including the in-service issues of the Trent 1000 programme. The accounting for these  can  be  complex  and  judgemental  and  may  impact  the consolidated  income  statement  immediately  or  over  the  life  of the  contract.  The  valuation  of  provisions  for  the  associated amounts are judgemental and need to be considered on a contract by contract basis.\n\nWe focused our work on a number of contracts where we consider there  to  be  the  highest  degree  of  management  judgement  or estimation and designed specific procedures over the long-term contract accounting targeted at the associated risks. We also sample tested the remaining population of contracts. The audit procedures performed included:\n\n- -We attended meetings with Civil Aerospace and Defence engine programme and customer contract managers in order to understand the operational matters impacting the performance of specific contracts and any amendments to contractual arrangements that could have an impact on performance;\n- -We obtained and read the relevant sections of a sample of contracts to understand the key terms including performance obligations and pricing structures;\n- -We assessed how management had forecast the speed and shape of the recovery of engine flying hours including by considering the downside scenarios modelled and comparing the assumptions to industry data;\n- -We challenged management's judgments and associated risk adjustments relating to the risk of customer default and insolvency;\n- -We re-performed the calculations used to determine the degree of completion for a sample of contracts and this was also used in assessing the magnitude of any catch-up adjustments;\n- -We compared the previously forecast results of a sample of contracts with the actual results to assess the performance of the contract and the historical accuracy of forecasting;\n- -We  verified  a  sample  of  costs  incurred  to  third  party documentation in order to assess the validity of the forecast costs to complete;\n- -We assessed the assumptions relating to life cycle cost reductions to determine the likelihood of realisation and where relevant the speed at which they would be achieved, including the impact on the number of shop visits, validating these assumptions directly with the senior programme engineers;\n- -We obtained support for the risk adjustments made in respect of future costs and challenged management's assumptions through assessment against historical performance, known technical issues and the stage of completion of the programme;\n- -We recalculated the price escalation included within the contracts based on recent experience;\n- -We challenged the assessment of provisions for onerous contracts to determine the completeness of the unavoidable costs to fulfil the contractual obligations. This included validating the additional provision recorded in the year to reflect the amended accounting standard which required such provisions to be recognised for all direct costs. We validated the rates used to discount the future cash flows and how management has considered the potential impact of climate change;\n- -We assessed the sensitivity of the Trent 1000 provision to reasonable changes in estimates, particularly in respect of the repair and overhaul facility capacity, technical cost creep on the known issues and cost outturns against previous provisions, in determining whether the provision was sufficient;\n- -We read and understood the key terms of a sample of RRSP contracts to assess whether revenue and costs had been appropriately reflected, net of the share attributable to the RRSP in the consolidated income statement;",

This included incorporating the potential impact of carbon  prices  on  the  group's  direct  emissions  including  engine testing and those of its suppliers and the potential impact of climate change on commodity prices in cost estimates. It also includes the estimated costs of demonstrating that all the commercial aero engines are compatible with sustainable aviation fuels. The impact of climate change  on  long-term  contracts  is  highly  uncertain  and  requires estimates on carbon prices, the cost and speed of decarbonisation, the ability of the group and its suppliers to pass on incremental costs and assessing the associated impact on aviation demand.\n\n## Deferred tax asset recognition and recoverability (group)\n\nAudit Committee report, note 1 to the consolidated financial statements -  Accounting  policies  -  Taxation  and  note  5  to  the  consolidated financial statements - Taxation\n\nThe recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets in Rolls-Royce plc is a significant judgement. Rolls-Royce plc has recognised significant deferred tax assets on the basis of expected future levels of profitability. The magnitude of the assets recognised necessitates the need for a number of assumptions in assessing the future levels of profitability in the UK over an extended period. This requires assumptions on future profits from the Group's aftermarket and original equipment sales includ -ing EFH levels, associated costs and the future exchange rates used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts.\n\nThe additional loss reported for 2022, along with the existence of tax losses brought forward and other deductible temporary differences in Rolls-Royce plc, combined with the impact of climate change on future forecasts, presents a heightened risk that deferred tax assets previously recognised may not be recoverable. Since the recognised deferred tax asset is recoverable over a long period, management has reflected their assessment of the impact of climate change within the model forecasting probable  taxable  profits.  This  incorporates  multiple  assumptions including  future  carbon  prices,  commodity  prices,  the  impact  of government  action  on  aviation  demand,  the  cost  and  speed  of decarbonisation and the ability of suppliers and Rolls-Royce plc to pass on  price  changes.  To  assess  the  impact  of  inherent  uncertainty management has performed sensitivities over key estimates.\n\n- -With assistance from our valuation experts, we considered the appropriateness of the key assumptions used by management to model the impact of climate change, including the reasonableness of the carbon and commodity price forecasts. We validated management's assertions on the ability of suppliers and the group to pass on incremental costs by reviewing supplier and customer contracts for price change mechanisms. Where appropriate we performed independent sensitivity analysis to determine to what extent reasonably possible changes in these assumptions could result in material changes to the revenue recorded in the year and assessed the appropriateness of the associated disclosures;\n- -We read and challenged management's accounting papers that were prepared to explain the positions taken in respect of their key contract judgements;\n- -We considered whether there were any indicators of management override of controls or bias in arriving at their reported position; and\n- -We also assessed the adequacy of disclosures in note 1 of the key judgements and estimates involved in long-term contract accounting.\n\nBased on the work performed, we concur that management's estimates for  long-term  contract  accounting  and  associated  provisions  is materially appropriate, in the context of the financial statements taken as a whole.\n\nWe evaluated management's methodology for assessing the recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets, including the ability to offset certain  deferred  tax  liabilities  and  deferred  tax  assets.  Where recognition  is  supported  by  the  availability  of  sufficient  probable taxable profits in future periods against which the asset can be utilised in future periods, our evaluation of these future profits considered both the business model and the applicable UK tax legislation.\n\nWe  assessed  the  future  profit  forecasts  and  the  underpinning assumptions including management's risk weighting of particular profit streams  in  Rolls-Royce  plc  and  tested  that  the  assumptions  and forecasts for periods beyond the normal five year forecasting horizon were reasonable. In doing this, we verified that the forecasts did not include  taxable  profit  growth  that  could  not  be  demonstrated  as probable.\n\nWe arrived at an independent range of long-term exchange rates based on historical movements in exchange rates and inflation expectations and compared this to management's rates.\n\nWhere applicable we assessed the consistency of the forecasts used to justify the recognition of deferred tax assets to those used elsewhere in  the  business,  including  for  long-term  contract  accounting, impairment  assessments,  or  for  the  Directors'  viability  and  going concern statements. We also assessed the risk adjustments applied by management  to  these  profit  forecasts  to  future  periods  that  are significantly further in time than the group's normal five year forecasting process  and  considered  whether  these  appropriately  reflect  the estimation risk to the longer term forecasts.",

One of the group's primary accounting systems  that  is  used  by  a  number  of  its  subsidiaries  translates transactions and balances denominated in foreign currencies at a fixed budget rate for management information purposes. Foreign currency denominated transactions and balances are then re-translated to actual average and closing spot rates through manual adjustments. Due to the manual  nature  of  the  process  and  significance  of  the  recurring adjustments  needed  there  is  a  risk  that  transactions  and  balances denominated in foreign currencies are incorrectly translated in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe considered the appropriateness of the climate change assumptions modelled as part of their probability weighted scenarios to forecast probable  profit  levels.  As  described  in  the  long-term  contract accounting and associated provisions key audit matter, this included deploying valuation experts to assess the reasonableness of carbon pricing  and  commodity  assumptions  as  well  as  the  comparison  of forecast aviation demand to third party sources. We considered the likelihood that the group and its suppliers would be able to pass on incremental climate related costs in the short, medium and longer term and verified that management's forecasts included the costs arising from the group's stated commitment to emissions reductions by 2030. We performed additional sensitivity analysis to understand whether reasonably  possible  changes  to  these  assumptions  could  lead  to  a material change in the recognised asset and where appropriate ensured that adequate disclosure was provided.\n\nWe assessed the treatment of the losses that are realised or unrealised on  the  group's  hedge  book  and  whether  they  were  treated appropriately  and  how  they  are  recovered  using  the  same  profit forecasts.\n\nWe also assessed the adequacy of disclosures over this area, particularly the impact of changes in key estimates of the asset recognised and this has been disclosed in notes 1 and 5.\n\nWe did not identify  any  material  uncorrected  exceptions  from  our audit work.\n\nIn addition to our testing in other areas, we performed the following specific audit procedures over this area:\n\n- -Obtained an understanding of the process employed by management to correctly record the translation of foreign currency balances and transactions;\n- -Tested system reports identifying transactions and balances in source currency by agreeing these to general ledger balances;\n- -Tested on a sample basis the manual calculations of the adjustment needed to correctly record the translation of the foreign currency denominated transactions and balances;\n- -We sampled balances and transactions requiring adjustment by source currency and tested to source data and assessed the completeness of these balances and transactions;\n- -We created an independent expectation of the loss on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities based on the movements in the group's key exchange rates and associated balances in the year;\n- -We agreed the exchange rates used in management's translation adjustments to an independent source; and\n- -For each adjustment sampled we assessed whether the foreign currency denominated balance or transaction was translated at the appropriate exchange rate depending on its nature.\n\nThere were no material uncorrected exceptions from our audit work.",

The group also presents a free cash flow metric which the Directors believe reflects the cash generated from underlying trading; this differs from the cash flows presented in the consolidated cash flow statement.\n\nThe  underlying  results  differ  significantly  from  the  reported statutory results and are used extensively to explain performance to the shareholders. Alternative performance measures can provide investors with additional understanding of the group's performance if consistently calculated, properly used and presented. However, when improperly used and presented, these non-GAAP measures can mislead investors and may mask the real financial performance and  position.  There  is  judgement  on  whether  items  should  be excluded from underlying profit or free cash flow.\n\nA key adjustment between the statutory results and the underlying results relates to the foreign exchange rates used to translate foreign currency transactions and balances. The underlying results reflect the achieved rate on foreign currency derivative contracts settled in the period and retranslates assets and liabilities at the foreign currency rates at which they are expected to be realised or settled in the future. As the group can influence which derivative contracts are settled in each reporting period it has the ability to influence the achieved rate and hence the underlying results. This risk is more limited for free cash flow as there are a small number of items that are excluded from free cash flows.\n\nDuring the year, the group excluded \u00a369m of credits from the net release of onerous contract and Trent-1000 provisions and a net \u00a322m of credits associated with changes to the group's pension schemes from underlying profit before tax. In addition, \u00a365m of impairment charges and \u00a347m of restructuring costs have also been excluded.\n\nWe  have  considered  the  judgements  taken  by  management  to determine what should be treated as an exceptional item and the translation of foreign currency amounts and obtained corroborative evidence for these.\n\nWe also considered whether there were items that were recorded within underlying profit that are exceptional in nature and should be reported  as  an  exceptional  item.  No  such  material  items  were identified. As part of this assessment we challenged management's rationale  for  the  designation  of  certain  items  as  exceptional  or one-off and assessed such items against the group's accounting policy, considering the nature and value of those items.\n\nWithin  underlying  results,  foreign  currency  transactions  are presented at rates achieved on derivative contracts hedging the net operating cash flows of the group and monetary assets and liabilities are  retranslated  at  rates  forecast  to  be  achieved  on  derivative contracts when the associated cash flows occur. We have agreed these forecast rates to the profile of the derivatives that are expected to mature in the future and tested their application to the relevant monetary assets and liabilities.\n\nWe audited the reconciling items between the underlying profit before tax and free cash flow disclosed in note 28 including verifying that the items adjusted for are consistent with the prior period. We also considered whether free cash flow contains material one-off items which require further disclosure.\n\nWe  assessed  the  appropriateness  and  completeness  of  the disclosures  of  the  impact  of  one-off  or  non-underlying  items primarily  in  notes  1,  2,  4  and  28  to  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  found  them  to  be  appropriate.  This  included assessing the explanations management provided on the reconciling items between underlying performance and statutory performance in note 2.\n\nOverall  we  found  that  the  classification  judgements  made  by management were in line with their policy for underlying results and exceptional items, had been consistently applied and there are no material uncorrected misstatements resulting from our testing.",

If such indicators exist, the recoverable amounts of the investments in subsidiaries are estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any. Any such impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nJudgement is required in this area, particularly in assessing: (1) whether an event has occurred that may indicate that the related asset values may not be recoverable; (2) whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the recoverable value, being the higher of fair value less cost of disposal or the net present value of future cash flows which are estimated based on the continued use of the asset in the business; and  (3)  key  assumptions  to  be  applied  in  preparing  cash  flow projections  including  whether  these  cash  flow  projections  are discounted using an appropriate rate. Changing the assumptions selected by management to determine the level of any impairment, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the recoverable value determined by the impairment test and as a result affect the company's financial condition and results.\n\nManagement has identified the increase in discount rates and the fall in market capitalisation since the date of the last impairment review as indicators  of  potential  impairment  which  has  necessitated  the performance  of  a  quantitative  impairment  assessment.  For  this purpose,  management  has  used  the  latest  available  cash  flow forecasts. Management has incorporated an estimate of the potential impact of climate change on the group's future cash flows, in particular the impact of carbon pricing and commodity prices on the group's future cost base and the potential impact on demand. Management found the investment carrying value to be supported by the future cash flows as a result of this exercise.\n\nWe evaluated management's determination that the decrease in the group's share price in 2022 along with the increases in cost of capital represented  potential  indicators  of  impairment.  The  associated recoverable  value  of  the  investments  was  determined  from  the discounted future cash flows of the group.\n\nWe have tested the reasonableness of the key assumptions used, including revenue, profit and cash flow growth rates, terminal growth rates and the discount rates that management has applied. We tested that  the  underlying  assumptions  were  consistent  with  other forecasts.  We  also  assessed  whether  management's  probability weighted cash flow forecasts appropriately reflect the estimation uncertainty over the group's forecast cash flows especially within Civil Aerospace.\n\nDeploying  our  valuation  experts,  we  assessed  certain  key assumptions such as the discount rate and the long-term growth rate used to project cash flows after the initial forecasting period.\n\nWe validated the key assumptions included within management's assessment of the impact of climate change on the group's cash flows. This included consideration of the costs of the group's stated commitment to emissions reductions by 2030.With the assistance of our  valuation  experts,  we  assessed  the  reasonableness  of management's assumptions on future carbon prices and changes in commodity prices. We also considered other estimates of the group's valuation such as third party analyst reports and considered the potential reasons why the market capitalisation of the group was lower  than  the  carrying  value  and  the  valuation  produced  by management, including the element of this that could reasonably be explained by control premium and other factors.\n\nWe  performed  our  own  independent  sensitivity  analysis  to understand  if  reasonable  possible  changes  in  management's assumptions would result in an impairment.\n\nWe reviewed the company's disclosure in note 1 to the company financial statements over this critical estimate and found this to be appropriate.\n\nAs a result of our work, we did not identify any material impairment and consider the carrying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings  to  be  supportable  in  the  context  of  the  company financial statements taken as a whole.",

We define a component as a single reporting unit which feeds into the group consolidation. Of the group's 427 reporting components, 33 individual components (including three joint ventures) were subject to full scope audits for group purposes, which following an element of sub-consolidation, equates to 16 group reporting opinions; and nine components performed targeted specified audit procedures.\n\nIn order to achieve audit coverage over the financial statements, under our audit methodology, we test both the design and operation of relevant business process controls and perform substantive testing over each financial statement line item.\n\nThe group operates Finance Service Centres (FSCs) to bulk process financial transactions in Derby (UK), Indianapolis (US) and Bengaluru (India). Based on our assessment it is not possible to fully test revenue and profit centrally as certain key processes, such as long-term contracting, remain within the business due to their nature and are not handled by the FSCs.\n\nOur audit covered 98% of revenue, 79% of loss before tax from continuing operations and 90% of total assets. All entities that contribute in excess of 1% of the group's revenue were included in scope.\n\nFurther specific audit procedures over central functions, the group consolidation and areas of significant judgement (including corporate costs, taxation, certain goodwill balances, intangible assets, treasury and post-retirement benefits) were directly led by the group audit team.\n\nWhere work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe issued formal written instructions to all component auditors setting out the audit work to be performed by each of them and maintained regular communication with the component auditors throughout the audit cycle. These interactions included attending certain component clearance meetings and holding regular conference calls, as well as reviewing and assessing any matters reported. The group engagement team also reviewed selected audit working papers for certain component teams to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained and fully understand the matters arising from the component audits.\n\nIn addition, senior members of the group engagement team have visited component teams across all group segments in the UK, US and Germany. These visits were in-person for these locations. They included meetings with the component auditor and with local management.\n\n## The impact of climate risk on our audit\n\nAs part of our audit we made enquiries of management to understand the process management adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate risk on the group's and company's financial statements and to support the disclosures made within the Sustainability section of the Strategic report. In addition to enquiries with management, we understood the governance process in place to assess climate risk, reviewed the group's assessment of climate related risk including both physical and transition risks and read additional reporting made on climate including its Carbon Disclosure Project public submission and the group's separate Climate Review which incorporates disclosures in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial disclosure (TCFD) framework.\n\nWe held meetings with management including the group's sustainability team to consider the completeness of management's climate risk assessment and its consistency with internal climate plans and board minutes, including whether the time horizons management have used take account of all relevant aspects of climate change such as transition risks. We also considered the consistency with the group's communications on climate related impacts. The group has publicly set out its target to achieve net carbon zero from operations by 2030 (excluding product testing and development), a target for a 50% reduction in total scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net zero 2050 commitments albeit the pathway to these commitments is not fully developed.\n\nWe considered the following areas which depend on medium to long term profit or cash flow forecasts to potentially be materially impacted by climate risk and consequently we focused our audit work in these areas: long-term contract accounting in the UK Civil business (including contract loss provisions); the recoverability of deferred tax assets in the UK; the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and certain intangible assets and the company's investments in subsidiary undertakings on the company balance sheet. Our findings were reported to and discussed with the Audit Committee and management. Where significant, further details of how climate change has been considered in these areas and our audit response is given in the key audit matters above.",

        "page_content": "To respond to the audit risks identified in these areas we tailored our audit approach to address these, in particular, we:\n\n- -Deployed our valuation experts to benchmark carbon pricing and key commodity price forecasts against forecasts of future prices and found them to be materially reasonable. These have been incorporated by management in their forecasts of the group's future cost base for long-term contract accounting and associated provisions as well as scenarios utilised in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, goodwill and other assets;\n- -Considered the reasonableness of management's assertion that climate change is unlikely to have a material impact on aviation demand by comparing management's EFH forecasts against other industry benchmarks;\n- -Verifying that the capital and cash costs of the group's climate change commitments have been incorporated in the group's forecasts including those used for going concern and the disclosures around the viability of the group that are included in the Strategic Report;\n- -Considered whether management had adequately reflected the risk of regulatory changes or demand changes to the extent known in the useful economic lives and recoverable value of other intangible assets including those related to diesel engines produced by Power Systems;\n- -Validated management's judgement that climate change is unlikely to have a material impact on other estimates as at 31 December 2022 including the recoverability of inventory or the expected credit loss provision associated with trade receivables and contract assets by considering the short timeframe these assets are expected to be utilised compared to the period over which transition and physical risks are expected to arise; and\n- -Where appropriate, performed independent sensitivity analysis to determine to what extent reasonably possible changes in the climate related assumptions in the group's forecasts could result in material changes to the impacted balances and assessed the appropriateness of the associated disclosures.\n\nWe also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change (including the disclosures in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report) within the Annual Report and the separate Climate Review with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained from our audit. This included considering the models management used in the TCFD scenario analysis and if the assumptions in those models are consistent with the assumptions used elsewhere in the financial statements.\n\nThe group has incorporated an estimate within its forecasts of the associated costs for its 2030 commitments to reach net zero for facilities and to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%. As disclosed within the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report and the Climate Review the achievement of net zero by 2050 will require significant change across the aviation sector in particular, including widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels or other alternative fuel sources. Management has not included the incremental cost of this over and above the costs to achieve its 2030 targets in its longer term forecasts, based on the assumptions that such costs can be passed onto customers and will occur after the average life of the current existing contracts.\n\nOur procedures did not identify any material impact in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole for the year ended 31 December 2022. The future estimated financial impacts of climate risk are clearly uncertain given the medium to long term timeframes involved and their dependency on how Governments, global markets, corporations and society respond to the issue of climate change and the speed of technological advancements that may be necessary. Accordingly, financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known.",

This is  because there is considerable volatility in profit before tax  as a result of revenue recognition under IFRS 15 and from  the  fair  value  movement  in  the  group's  derivatives.  Underlying revenue continues to be a key performance  metric for the group and is more stable than the profit met - ric. However, from 2020 COVID-19 introduced additional  volatility that impacted benchmarks. To mitigate this we have | We determined  our  materiality  based  on  total  assets,  which  is  more  applicable  than  a  performance-related  measure  as  the  company  is  an  investment  holding  company for the group. The higher company materiality  level was used for the purposes of testing balances not  relevant  to  the  group  audit,  such  as  investments  in  subsidiary undertakings and intercompany balances. |\n\nFor each component in the scope of our group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between \u00a34m and \u00a367m. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall group materiality.\n\nWe use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of overall materiality, amounting to \u00a360m (2021: \u00a360m) for the group financial statements and \u00a3110m (2021: \u00a3110m) for the company financial statements.\n\nIn determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors - the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls - and concluded that an amount at the upper end of our normal range was appropriate.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above \u00a33m (group audit) (2021: \u00a33m) and \u00a37m (company audit) (2021: \u00a37m) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.",

        "page_content": "## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and the company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- -Testing the model used for management's going concern assessment which is primarily a liquidity assessment given there are no significant financial covenants in its committed debt facilities. Management's assessment covered the 18 months to August 2024. We focussed on this period and also considered the subsequent four months to the end of 2024.\n- -Management's base case forecasts are based on its normal budget and forecasting process for each of its businesses for the next five years. We understood and assessed this process by business including the assumptions used for 2023 and 2024 and assessed whether there was adequate support for these assumptions. We also considered the reasonableness of the monthly phasing of cash flows. A similar assessment was performed of both downside and stressed downside cash flows, including understanding of the scenarios modelled by management, how they were quantified and the resultant monthly phasing of the downside and stressed downside cash flow forecasts.\n- -We have read and understood the key terms of all committed debt facilities to understand any terms, covenants or undertakings that may impact the availability of the facility.\n- -Using our knowledge from the audit and assessment of previous forecasting accuracy we calculated our own sensitivities to apply to management's cash flow forecasts. We overlaid these on management's forecasts to arrive at our own view of management's downside forecasts. This included consideration of management's assessment of the impact of climate change and the likelihood of any downside risks crystallising in the period to August 2024.\n- -We considered the potential mitigating actions that management may have available to it to reduce costs, manage cash flows or raise additional financing and assessed whether these were within the control of management and possible in the period of the assessment.\n- -We assessed the adequacy of disclosures in the Going Concern statement and statements in note 1 of the consolidated and company financial statements and found these appropriately reflect the key areas of uncertainty identified.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHowever, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nIn relation to the directors' reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## Reporting on other information\n\nThe other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information, which includes reporting based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities.\n\nWith respect to the Strategic report and Directors' report, we also considered whether the disclosures required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.",

Our additional responsibilities with respect to the corporate governance statement as other information are described in the Reporting on other information section of this report.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement, included within the governance report is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit, and we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- -The directors' confirmation that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks;\n- -The disclosures in the Annual Report that describe those principal risks, what procedures are in place to identify emerging risks and an explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated;\n- -The directors' statement in the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them, and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group's and company's ability to continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements;\n- -The directors' explanation as to their assessment of the group's and company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate; and\n- -The directors' statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of its assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nOur review of the directors' statement regarding the longer-term viability of the group and company was substantially less in scope than an audit and only consisted of making inquiries and considering the directors' process supporting their statement; checking that the statement is in alignment with the relevant provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code; and considering whether the statement is consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge and understanding of the group and company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit.\n\nIn addition, based on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the corporate governance statement is materially consistent with the financial statements and our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- -The directors' statement that they consider the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for the members to assess the group's and company's position, performance, business model and strategy;\n- -The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems; and\n- -The section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of our responsibility to report when the directors' statement relating to the company's compliance with the Code does not properly disclose a departure from a relevant provision of the Code specified under the Listing Rules for review by the auditors.",

The directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to the regulations of country aviation authorities such as the Civil Aviation Authority, import and export restrictions including sanctions, and the UK Bribery Act, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the financial statements such as the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the Companies Act 2006 and tax legislation. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to (1) posting inappropriate journal entries to manipulate financial results; (2) management bias in accounting estimates such as long-term contract accounting and associated provisions, the recoverability of intangible programme assets, and deferred tax asset recognition; (3) the sale of Civil engines to joint ventures for no clear commercial purpose or above market prices; and (4) inappropriately including or excluding transactions from the group's underlying or free cash flow alternative performance metrics. The group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the group engagement team and/or component auditors included:\n\n- -Discussions throughout the year with management, internal audit, the group's internal and external legal counsel, and the head of ethics and compliance, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud;\n- -Reading the minutes of the group's Safety, Ethics & Sustainability committee and assessment of 'speak-up' matters reported through the group's Ethics Line and the results of management's investigation of such matters;\n- -Reading the minutes of Board meetings to identify any inconsistencies with other information provided by management;\n- -Reviewing legal expense accounts to identify significant legal spend that may be indicative of non-compliance with laws and regulations;\n- -Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in determining significant accounting estimates (because of the risk of management bias), in particular in relation to long-term contract accounting and associated provisions, the recoverability of programme assets, and the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see related key audit matters above);\n- -Identifying and testing unusual journal entries, in particular journal entries posted with unusual account combinations, and testing all material consolidation journals; and\n- -Challenging why certain items are excluded or included from underlying profit or free cash flow and review of disclosures included in the Annual Report explaining and reconciling alternative performance measures to statutory metrics.\n\nThere are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above. We are less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that are not closely related to events and transactions reflected in the financial statements. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion.",

The objective is to provide assurance to Rolls-Royce and its stakeholders over the accuracy and reliability of the reported information and data.\n\n## Scope of work\n\nThe scope of our work was limited to assurance over the following i nformation included within the Report ('the Report') for the period 1 January to 31 December 2022 (the 'Selected Information'):\n\n- -Total Energy consumption;\n- -Total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (location based);\n- -Total waste;\n- -Total Reportable Injuries;\n- -Number of people reached through the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education outreach programmes; and\n- -Employee engagement score 'grand mean' and increase compared to 2021.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe Selected Information are reported according to the Rolls-Royce 'Basis of Reporting', a copy of which is available from https://www.rolls-royce. com/sustainability.aspx.\n\n## Limitations and exclusions\n\nExcluded from the scope of our work is assurance of information relating to:\n\n- -Activities outside the defined assurance period;\n- -Positional statements of a descriptive or interpretative nature, or of opinion, belief, aspiration or commitment to undertake future actions; and\n- -Other information included in the Report other than the Selected Information.\n\nThe following limitations should be noted:\n\n- -This limited assurance engagement relies on a risk based selected sample of sustainability data and the associated limitations that this entails.\n- -This independent statement should not be relied upon to detect all errors, omissions or misstatements that may exist.\n- -The waste and energy data for Magdaburg site were assumed based on 2021 actuals and normalised against 2022 production figures due to operational challenges.\n- -Total Annual Waste, GHG and Energy Calculation - Roll Royce Total annual GHG, Energy and Waste values are estimates based on ten months of actual data (January to October), since it is not possible to provide the complete full year data within the engagement timeframe.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThis preparation and presentation of the Selected Information in the Report are the sole responsibility of the management of Rolls-Royce.\n\nBureau Veritas was not involved in the drafting of the Report or of the Reporting Criteria. Our responsibilities were to:\n\n- -obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Information has been prepared in accordance with the Reporting Criteria;\n- -form an independent conclusion based on the assurance procedures performed and evidence obtained; and\n- -report our conclusions to the directors of Rolls-Royce.\n\n## Assessment Standard\n\nWe performed our work to a limited level of assurance in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance  Engagements  Other  than  Audits  or  Reviews  of Historical Financial Information (effective for assurance reports dated on or after December 15, 2015), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\n\n## Summary of work performed\n\nAs part of our independent assurance, our work included:\n\n- 1. Conducting interviews with relevant personnel of Rolls-Royce;\n- 2.  Reviewing the data collection and consolidation processes used to compile Selected Information, including assessing assumptions made, and the data scope and reporting boundaries;\n- 3.  Reviewing documentary evidence provided by Rolls-Royce;\n- 4.  Agreeing a selection of the Selected Information to the corresponding source documentation;\n- 5.  Reviewing Rolls-Royce systems for quantitative data aggregation and analysis;\n- 6.  Assessing the disclosure and presentation of the Selected Information to ensure consistency with assured information;\n- 7. Carrying out 9 site visits, selected on a risk based basis to United Kingdom, United States, Germany, Canada and Singapore. These sites are  within  the  top  25  sites  to  contribute  over  the  Selected Information;\n- 8.  Confirmation of accuracy of information with third parties and/or external stakeholders;\n- 9.  Re-performing a selection of aggregation calculations of the Selected Information;\n- 10. Re-performing greenhouse gas emissions conversions calculations.\n\nA 5% materiality threshold was applied to this assurance. It should be noted that the procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOn the basis of our methodology and the activities and limitations described above nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the Selected Information is not fairly stated in all material respects.\n\n## Statement of Independence, Integrity and Competence\n\nBureau Veritas is an independent professional services company that specialises  in  quality,  environmental,  health,  safety  and  social accountability with over 190 years history. Its assurance team has extensive experience in conducting verification over environmental, social, ethical and health and safety information, systems and processes.\n\nBureau Veritas operates a certified 1 Quality Management System which complies with the requirements of ISO 9001:2015, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, quality reviews and applicable legal and regulatory requirements which we consider to be equivalent to ISQM 1 & 2 2 .\n\nBureau Veritas has implemented and applies a Code of Ethics, which meets the requirements of the International Federation of Inspections Agencies (IFIA) 3 , across the business to ensure that its employees maintain integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, professional behaviour and high ethical standards in their day-to-day business activities.

This energy is used by the majority of our facilities in the UK and Germany. The source in the UK includes a proportion of electricity that was generated by the combustion of biofuel. The associated emissions are included above under the location-based Scope 2 emissions (using grid average emission factors). They are also reported separately as market-based Scope 2 emissions (covering the emissions of nitrous oxide and methane) and Outside of Scopes (covering the emissions of carbon dioxide). In addition, the above figures include 9,209,251 kWh of electricity and heat generated on-site from renewable energy sources, including solar panels and ground source heat pumps.\n\nWe include the reporting of fugitive emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), associated with air conditioning equipment, into our GHG emissions figures. These include emissions from our facilities in the US and Canada only. We do not anticipate that emissions from other facilities will have a significant impact on the above figures.\n\nWith the exceptions noted above, we have reported on the underlying energy use and emission sources required under the Companies (Directors'\n\nReport) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018. In accordance with these regulations, the above statement includes emissions associated with the ITP Aero business which was classified as a discontinued business on 30 June 2021, since Rolls-Royce remained responsible for its activities until it was sold on 15 September 2022. All these sources fall within the scope of our Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have used the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition) as of 31 December 2014 utilising the operational control approach, supplemented by the GHG Reporting Guidance for the Aerospace Industry (version 3) and emission factors from the UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2022. We report our emissions of: carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons on a carbon dioxide equivalent basis. We had no emissions of sulphur hexafluoride or nitrogen trioxide.\n\nFurther details on our methodology for reporting and the criteria used can be found within our basis of reporting, available to download at www.rolls-royce.com",

The average and spot rates for the principal trading currencies of the Group are shown in the table below:\n\n|             |                    |   2022 |   2021 | Change   |\n|-------------|--------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n|             | Year-end spot rate |   1.2  |   1.35 | -11%     |\n| USD per GBP | Average spot rate  |   1.24 |   1.38 | -10%     |\n|             | Year-end spot rate |   1.13 |   1.19 | -5%      |\n| EUR per GBP | Average spot rate  |   1.17 |   1.16 | +1%      |\n\n## The Group's global corporate income tax contribution\n\nThe Group's total corporation tax payments in 2022 were \u00a3174m. Around 90% of this is paid in the US, Germany, Singapore and Canada. Together with the UK, where tax losses are currently generated (see note 5), the operations in these countries are where the majority of the Group's business is undertaken and employees are based. The balance of tax payments are made in around 40 other countries.\n\nIn common with most multinational groups, the total of all profits and losses for corporate income tax purposes is not the same as the consolidated loss before taxation reported on page 102.\n\nThe main reasons for this are:\n\n- (i) the consolidated income statement is prepared under IFRS, whereas the corporate income tax profits and losses for each company are determined by local tax accounting rules;\n- (ii) accounting rules require certain income and costs relating to our commercial activities to be eliminated from, or added to, the aggregate of all the profits of the Group companies when preparing the consolidated income statement (consolidation adjustments); and\n- (iii)  specific tax rules including exemptions or incentives as determined by the tax laws in each country.\n\nI n most cases, paragraphs (i) and (ii) above are only a matter of timing and therefore tax will be paid in an earlier or later year. The impact of paragraph (iii) above will often be permanent depending on the relevant tax law. Further information on the tax position of the Group can be found as follows:\n\n- -Audit Committee Report (page 73) - updates given to the Audit Committee during the year;\n- -note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 118) - details of key areas of uncertainty and accounting policies for tax;\n- -note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements (pages 133 to 136)\n- -Details of the tax balances in the Consolidated Financial Statements together with a tax reconciliation. This explains the main drivers of the tax rate and the impact of our assessment on the recovery of UK deferred tax assets.\n\nThe Group subjects all major investments and capital expenditure to a rigorous examination of risks and future cash flows to ensure that they create shareholder value. All major investments, including the launch of major programmes, require Board approval.\n\nThe Group has a portfolio of projects at different stages of their lifecycles. All of our major investments and projects are assessed using a range of financial metrics, including discounted cash flow and return on investment.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Board has established a structured approach to financial risk management. The Financial risk committee (Frc) is accountable for managing, reporting and mitigating the Group's financial risks and exposures. These risks include the Group's principal counterparty, currency, interest rate, commodity price, liquidity and credit rating risks outlined in more depth in note 20. The Frc is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer. The Group has a comprehensive financial risk policy that advocates the use of financial instruments to manage and hedge business operations risks that arise from movements in financial, commodities, credit or money markets. The Group's policy is not to engage in speculative financial transactions. The Frc sits quarterly to review and assess the key risks and agree any mitigating actions required.\n\n## Capital structure\n\n| \u00a3m               | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total equity     | (6,016) | (4,636) |\n| Cash flow hedges | (26)    | 45      |\n| Group capital    | (6,042) | (4,591) |\n| Net debt         | (3,251) | (5,157) |\n\nOperations are funded through various shareholders' funds, bank borrowings, bonds and notes. The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the Board as to the appropriate balance of funding required. Funding is secured by the Group's continued access to the global debt markets. Borrowings are funded in various currencies using derivatives where appropriate to achieve a required currency and interest rate profile. The Board's objective is to retain sufficient financial investments and undrawn facilities to ensure that the Group can both meet its medium-term operational commitments and cope with unforeseen obligations and opportunities.\n\nThe Group holds cash and short-term investments which, together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable it to manage its liquidity risk.\n\nDuring the year, the Group repaid the \u00a32.0bn loan, supported by an 80% guarantee from UK Export Finance.\n\nI nformation on the approach to managing the Group's tax affairs can be found at www.rolls-royce.com.",

        "page_content": "During the year, the Group entered into a new \u00a31.0bn loan, maturing in 2027 (supported by an 80% guarantee from UK Export Finance (UKEF)).\n\nThe \u00a32.5bn revolving credit facility, the \u00a31.0bn UKEF-supported loan, the \u00a31.0bn sustainability linked UKEF-supported loan and \u00a31.0bn bank loan were undrawn at the year end.\n\nAt the year end, the Group retained aggregate liquidity of \u00a38.1bn, including cash and cash equivalents of \u00a32.6bn and undrawn borrowing facilities of \u00a35.5bn.\n\nThe Group has no material debt maturities until 2024. The maturity profile of the borrowing facilities is regularly reviewed to ensure that refinancing levels are manageable in the context of the business and market conditions. There are no rating triggers in any borrowing facility that would require the facility to be accelerated or repaid due to an adverse movement in the Group's credit rating. The Group conducts some of its business through a number of joint ventures. A major proportion of the debt of these joint ventures is secured on the assets of the respective companies and is non-recourse to the Group. This debt is further outlined in note 17.\n\n## Credit rating\n\n| \u00a3m                        | Rating   | Outlook   |\n|---------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Moody's Investors Service | Ba3      | Stable    |\n| Standard & Poor's         | BB-      | Positive  |\n| Fitch                     | BB-      | Positive  |\n\nThe Group subscribes to Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch for independent long-term credit ratings with the ratings in the table above being applicable at the date of this report.\n\n## Accounting\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the UK.\n\nNo new accounting standards had a material impact in 2022. During the year, the Group adopted the amendment to IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets for Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract on 1 January 2022. As a result of the amendment, the cumulative effect of adopting the amendment has been recognised as an adjustment to opening balance of retained earnings and provisions. See page 112 for further detail.\n\nOther than IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts described on page 125, where the Group is in the process of concluding its analysis of whether there is any further impact as a result of adopting the new standard, the Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable will have a significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements in 2023.",

These alternative performance measures reflect the economic substance of trading in the year/period, including the impact of the Group's foreign exchange activities. In addition, a number of other APMs are utilised to measure and monitor the Group's performance.\n\nDefinitions and reconciliations to the relevant statutory measure are included below.\n\n## Underlying results from continuing operations\n\nUnderlying results include underlying revenue, underlying operating profit and underlying EPS. Underlying results are presented by recording all relevant revenue and cost of sales transactions at the average exchange rate achieved on effective settled derivative contracts in the period that the cash flow occurs. Underlying results also exclude: the effect of acquisition accounting and business disposals, impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets where the reasons for the impairment are outside of normal operating activities, exceptional items and certain other items which are market driven and outside of managements control. Statutory results have been adjusted for discontinued operations and underlying results from continuing operations have been presented on the same basis.

Free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities, including capital expenditure and movements in investments, capital elements of lease payments, interest paid and excluding amounts spent or received on activity related to business acquisitions or disposals, financial penalties paid and exceptional restructuring payments. Free cash flow from continuing operations has been presented to remove free cash flow from discontinued operations, as defined in note 27.

In addition, Warren East, Lee Hsien Yang and Irene Dorner served as Directors during the year, before stepping down from the Board. Their respective resignation dates can be found on page 70.\n\n## Directors' indemnities\n\nThe Directors have the benefit of an indemnity provision contained in the Articles. In addition, the Directors have been granted a qualifying third-party indemnity provision which was in force throughout the financial year and remains in force. Also, throughout the year, the Company purchased and maintained directors' and officers' liability insurance in respect of the Company and its subsidiaries and for their directors and officers.\n\n## Share price\n\nDuring the year, the share price decreased by 25% from 122p to 92p, compared to an 11% increase in the FTSE aerospace and defence sector and a 1% increase in the FTSE 100. The Company's share price ranged from 130p in January 2022 to 64p in September 2022.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOn 31 December 2022, the Company's issued share capital comprised:\n\n| 8,367,596,989   | Ordinary Shares   | 20p each   |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 23,854,740,218  | C Shares          | 0.1p each  |\n| 1               | Special Share     | \u00a31         |\n\nThe Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares (C Shares) as an alternative to paying a cash dividend. Further information on payments to shareholders is on page 210.\n\n## Share class rights\n\nThe full share class rights are set out in the Company's Articles, which are available at www.rolls-royce.com. The rights are summarised below.\n\n## Ordinary shares\n\nEach member has one vote for each Ordinary Share held. Holders of Ordinary Shares are entitled to: receive the Company's Annual Report; attend and speak at general meetings of the Company; appoint one or more proxies or, if they are corporations, corporate representatives; and exercise voting rights. Holders of Ordinary Shares may receive a bonus issue of C Shares or a dividend and on liquidation may share in the assets of the Company.\n\n## C Shares\n\nC Shares have limited voting rights and attract a preferential dividend, paid on a twice-yearly basis. On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of C Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of Ordinary Shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on the C Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have been accrued but not paid until the date of return of capital. The holders of C Shares are only entitled to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting if a resolution to wind up the Company is to be considered, in which case they may vote only on that resolution. The Company has the option to redeem the C Shares compulsorily, at any time if: the aggregate number of C Shares in i ssue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of all C Shares issued on or prior to that time or the event of a capital restructuring of the Company; the introduction of a new holding company; the acquisition of the Company by another company; or a demerger from the Group.\n\n## Special Share\n\nCertain rights attach to the special rights non-voting share (Special Share) issued to the UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (Special Shareholder). These rights are set out in the Articles. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act), the Treasury Solicitor may redeem the Special Share at par value at any time. The Special Share confers no rights to dividends but, in the event of a winding-up, it shall be repaid at its nominal value in priority to any other shares.\n\nCertain provisions of the Articles (in particular those relating to the foreign shareholding limit, disposals and the nationality of the Company's Directors) that relate to the rights attached to the Special Share may only be altered with the consent of the Special Shareholder. The Special Shareholder is not entitled to vote at any general meeting or any other meeting of any class of shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Restrictions on transfer of shares and limitations on holdings\n\nThere are no restrictions on transfer or limitations on the holding of the Ordinary Shares or C Shares other than under the Articles (as described here), under restrictions imposed by law or regulation (for example, UK Market Abuse Regulations) or pursuant to the Company's inside information and share dealing policy. The Articles provide that the Company should be and remain under UK control. As such, an individual foreign shareholding limit is set at 15% of the aggregate votes attaching to the share capital of all classes (taken as a whole) and capable of being cast on a poll and to all other shares that the Directors determine are to be included in the calculation of that holding. The Special Share may only be issued to, held by and transferred to the Special Shareholder or their successor or nominee.\n\n## Shareholder agreements and consent requirements\n\nNo disposal may be made to a non-Group member which, alone or when aggregated with the same or a connected transaction, constitutes a disposal of the whole or a material part of either the nuclear propulsion business or the assets of the Group as a whole, without the consent of the Special Shareholder.\n\n## Authority to issue shares\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, an ordinary resolution was passed authorising the Directors to allot new ordinary shares up to a nominal value of \u00a3557,839,799, equivalent to one-third of the issued share capital of the Company. This resolution also authorised the Directors to allot up to two-thirds of the total issued share capital of the Company, although only in the case of a rights issue. A further special resolution was passed to effect a disapplication of pre-emption rights for a maximum of 5% of the issued share capital of the Company. These authorities are valid until the 2023 AGM or 30 June 2023, whichever is sooner, and the Directors propose to renew each of them at the 2023 AGM to be held on 11 May 2023. The Board believes that these authorities will allow the Company to retain flexibility to respond to circumstances and opportunities as they arise.\n\n## Authority to purchase own shares\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, the Company was authorised by shareholders to purchase up to 836,759,698 of its own ordinary shares, representing 10% of its issued ordinary share capital.\n\nThe authority for the Company to purchase its own shares expires at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM or 30 June 2023, whichever is sooner. A resolution to renew the authority will be proposed at the 2023 meeting.\n\nThe Company did not purchase any of its own ordinary shares under this authority during 2022.\n\n## Deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nElectronic and paper proxy appointments, together with voting instructions, must be received by the Registrar not less than 48 hours before a general meeting.\n\n| Shareholder                               | Date of change in interest   |   % of issued ordinary share capital |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Blackrock, Inc.                           | 17 November 2022             |                                 6.39 |\n| Causeway Capital  Management LLC          | 10 November 2022             |                                 8.95 |\n| Harris Associates L.P.                    | 16 November 2020             |                                 4.99 |\n| Massachusetts Financial  Services Company | 28 March 2022                |                                 4.94 |\n| The Capital Group  Companies, Inc.        | 3 February 2022              |                                 4.98 |\n\n## Changes to the Articles of Association\n\nThe Articles may be amended or new articles may be adopted by a special resolution of the shareholders of the Company, subject to the provisions of the Act.\n\n## Change of control\n\n## Contracts and joint venture agreements\n\nThere are a number of contracts and joint venture agreements which would allow the counterparties to terminate or alter those arrangements in the event of a change of control of the Company. These arrangements are commercially confidential and their disclosure could be seriously prejudicial to the Company.\n\n## Borrowings and other financial instruments\n\nThe Group has a number of borrowing facilities provided by various banks. These facilities generally include provisions which may require any outstanding borrowings to be repaid or the alteration or termination of the facility upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company. At 31 December 2022, these facilities were 27% drawn (2021: 47%).\n\nThe Group has entered into a series of financial instruments to hedge i t s currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. These contracts provide for termination or alteration in the event that a change of control of the Company materially weakens the creditworthiness of the Group.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\nIn the event of a change of control of the Company, the effect on the employee share plans would be as follows:\n\n- -Incentive Plan - deferred share awards will normally vest immediately, and may be time pro-rated. The new controlling company might\n\n## Voting rights for employee share plan shares\n\nShares are held in an employee benefit trust for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the various employee share plans. For shares held in a nominee capacity or if plan/trust rules provide the participant with the right to vote in respect of specifically allocated shares, the trustee votes in line with the participants' instructions. For shares that are not held absolutely on behalf of specific individuals, the general policy of the trustees, in accordance with investor protection guidelines, is to abstain from voting in respect of those shares.\n\n## Major shareholdings\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the following shareholders had notified an interest in the issued ordinary share capital of the Company in accordance with section 5.1.2 of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules:",

The new controlling company might offer an equivalent option in exchange for cancellation of the existing option.\n- -Share Purchase Plan (SPP) - consideration received as shares would be held within the SPP, if possible, otherwise the consideration would be treated as a disposal from the SPP.\n- -LTIP - awards would vest on the change of control, subject to the Remuneration Committee's judgement of performance and may be reduced pro rata to service in the vesting period. Any applicable holding period will cease in the event of a change of control.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Company's policy is that it does not, directly or through any subsidiary, make what are commonly regarded as donations to any political party. However, the Act defines political donations very broadly and so it is possible that normal business activities, such as sponsorship, subscriptions, payment of expenses, paid leave for employees fulfilling certain public duties and support for bodies representing the business community in policy review or reform, which might not be thought of as political expenditure in the usual sense, could be captured. Activities of this nature would not be thought of as political donations in the ordinary sense of those words. The resolution to be proposed at the 2023 AGM, authorising political donations and expenditure, is to ensure that the Group does not commit any technical breach of the Act.\n\nDuring the year, expenses incurred by Rolls-Royce North America, Inc. in providing administrative support for the Rolls-Royce North America political action committee (PAC) was US$ 59,169.05 (2021: US$41,852). PACs are a common feature of the US political system and are governed by the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n\nThe PAC is independent of the Group and independent of any political party. The PAC funds are contributed voluntarily by employees and the Group cannot affect how they are applied, although under US law, the business expenses are paid by the employee's company. Such contributions do not count towards the limits for political donations and expenditure for which shareholder approval will be sought at this year's AGM to renew the authority given at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Disclosures in the Strategic Report\n\nThe Board has taken advantage of section 414C(11) of the Act to include disclosures in the Strategic Report including:\n\n- -employee involvement;\n- -the employment of disabled people;\n- -the future development, performance and position of the Group; and\n- -research and development activities.\n\n## Information required by UK Listing Rule (LR) 9.8.4\n\nThere are no disclosures to be made under LR 9.8.4.\n\n## Management report\n\nThe Strategic Report and the Directors' Report together are the management report for the purposes of Rule 4.1.8R of the DTR.\n\nBy order of the Board Pamela Coles Chief Governance Officer 23 February 2023\n\n## Voluntary disclosures required under Listing Rule 9.8.6 as at 31 December 2022\n\n## Gender identity\n\n|                                 | Number of  Board  members   | Percentage  of the  Board   | Number of  senior positions  on the Board   | Number in  executive  management   | Percentage of  executive  management   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Men                             | 8                           | 66.7%                       | Chief Executive, CFO                        | 7                                  | 77.8%                                  |\n| Women                           | 4                           | 33.3%                       | Chair                                       | 2                                  | 22.2%                                  |\n| Other categories                | -                           | -                           | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say | -                           | -                           | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |\n\n## Ethnic background\n\n|                                                                 | Number of  Board  members   | Percentage  of the  Board   | Number of  senior positions  on the Board   | Number in  executive  management   | Percentage of  executive  management   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| White British or other White  (including minority-white groups) | 11                          | 91.7%                       | Chair, Chief Executive,  CFO and the SID    | 9                                  | 100%                                   |\n| Mixed/multiple ethnic groups                                    | -                           | -                           | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |\n| Asian/Asian British                                             | 1                           | 8.3%                        | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                           | -                           | -                           | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |\n| Other ethnic group, including Arab                              | -                           | -                           | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |\n| Not specified/prefer not to say                                 | -                           | -                           | -                                           | -                                  | -                                      |",

        "page_content": "## S H A R E H O L D E R  I N F O R M A T I O N SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION\n\n## Managing your shareholding\n\nYour shareholding is managed by Equiniti Limited (the Registrar). When making contact with the Registrar, please quote your shareholder reference number (SRN). This is an 11-digit number that can be found on  your  share  certificate  or  in  any  other  shareholder correspondence.\n\nYou can manage your shareholding at www.shareview.co.uk, speak to the Registrar on +44 (0)371 384 2637 (8.30am to 5.30pm Monday to Friday) or you can write to the Registrar at Equiniti, Aspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA.\n\nI f  you hold your shares in a share dealing account (sometimes referred to as a nominee account), then you must contact your account provider with any questions about your shareholding.\n\n## Payments to shareholders\n\nThe Company makes payments to shareholders by issuing redeemable C Shares of 0.1p each. You can redeem C Shares for cash and either take the cash or reinvest the proceeds in the C Share Reinvestment Plan (CRIP) to purchase additional Ordinary Shares providing you complete a payment instruction form, which is available from the Registrar. Once you have submitted your payment instruction form, you will receive cash or additional ordinary shares each time the Company issues C Shares. If you choose to receive cash, we strongly recommend that you include your bank details on the payment instruction form and have payments credited directly to your bank account. This removes the risk of a cheque going astray and means that cleared payments will be credited to your bank account on the payment date.\n\nWe had a ten year track record of payments to shareholders prior to the pandemic but we had to cease payments in 2020 to protect our balance sheet. We are still restricted by some of the conditions attached to our loan facilities from making payments to shareholders at this time. We are committed to returning to an investment grade credit rating through performance improvement and to resuming shareholder payments.\n\nShareholders wishing to redeem their existing C Shares, or participate in the CRIP must lodge instructions with the Registrar to arrive no later than 5.00pm on 1 June 2023 (CREST holders must submit their election in CREST by 2.55pm). The payment of C Share redemption monies will be made on 5 July 2023 and the CRIP purchase will begin as soon as practicable after 6 July 2023.\n\n## Share dealing\n\nThe Registrar offers shareholders an internet dealing service at www.shareview.co.uk and a postal dealing service. Real-time dealing is available during market hours, 8.00am to 4.30pm, Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays. Orders can still be placed outside of market hours. The fee for internet dealing is 1.5% of the transaction value, subject to a minimum fee of \u00a345. The fee for telephone dealing is 1.5% of the transaction value, subject to a minimum fee of \u00a360. The fee for postal dealing is 1.9% of the transaction value, subject to a minimum fee of \u00a370. This service is only available to shareholders resident in certain jurisdictions. Before you can trade you must register to use the service. Other share dealing facilities are available but you should always use a firm regulated by the FCA (see www.fca.org.uk/register).\n\n## Your share certificate\n\nYour share certificate is an important document. If you sell or transfer your shares you must make sure that you have a valid share certificate in the name of Rolls-Royce Holdings plc. If you place an instruction to sell your shares and cannot provide a valid share certificate, the transaction cannot be completed and you may be liable for any costs i ncurred by the broker. If you are unable to find your share certificate, please inform the Registrar immediately.\n\n## American Depositary Receipts (ADR)\n\nADR holders should contact the depositary, JP Morgan, by calling +1(800) 990 1135 (toll free within the US) or +1(651) 453 2128 (outside the US) or via www.adr.com/contact/jpmorgan\n\n## Warning to shareholders - investment scams\n\nWe are aware that some of our shareholders have received unsolicited telephone calls or correspondence, offering to buy or sell their shares at very favourable terms. The callers can be very persuasive and extremely persistent and often have professional websites and telephone numbers to support their activities.\n\nThese callers will sometimes imply a connection to Rolls-Royce and provide incorrect or misleading information. This type of call should be treated as an investment scam - the safest thing to do is hang up. Remember: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\n\nYou should always check that any firm contacting you about potential investment opportunities is properly authorised by the FCA. If you deal with an unauthorised firm you will not be eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. You can find out more about protecting yourself from investment scams by visiting the FCA's website at www.fca.org.uk/consumers, or by calling the FCA's consumer helpline on 0800 111 6768 (overseas callers dial +44 20 70661000). If you have already paid money to share fraudsters, contact Action Fraud immediately on 0300 123 2040, whose website is www.actionfraud.police.uk\n\n## Visit Rolls-Royce online\n\nVisit www.rolls-royce.com to find out more about the latest financial results, the share price, payments to shareholders, the financial calendar and shareholder services.\n\n## Communication preferences\n\nYou can sign up to receive the latest news updates to your phone or email by visiting www.rolls-royce.com and registering for our alert service. If you do not wish to receive a hard copy Annual Report in future, please email customer@equiniti.com\n\n## Annual general meeting (AGM)\n\nAGMs must be convened each year within six months of the Company's accounting reference date with 21 clear days' advance written notice given to shareholders. Under the Articles, any other general meeting may be convened provided at least 14 clear days' written notice is given, subject to annual approval by shareholders. In certain limited circumstances, the Company can convene a general meeting at shorter notice. The notice must specify, amongst other things, the nature of the business to be transacted, the place, the date and time of the meeting.\n\nThe 2023 AGM will be held at 11.00am on 11 May 2023 as a hybrid meeting. Full details are available on our website at www.rolls-royce.com",
