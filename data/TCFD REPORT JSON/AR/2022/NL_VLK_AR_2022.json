No rights can be derived from using the website version, including the unofficial copy of the auditor's opinion. Our auditors did not determine (nor do they need to) that the website version is identical to the official version.\n\n## Unrounded figures\n\nAmounts in the annual report may not add up due to being rounded up or down. The total amounts may therefore deviate from the sum of the parts. Percentage changes are based on the unrounded figures.\n\n## Changes to comparative figures\n\nSome amounts may differ from previously published reports; in these cases, explanations are given in the footnotes.\n\n## Naming conventions\n\nOn 28 November 2022, Kempen & Co was rebranded to Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Banking.

We included the July-December 2021 figures for Mercier Vanderlinden in Van Lanschot Kempen's 2021 figures. In December 2022, we announced the acquisition of the remaining 30% of the shares.\n\n## Disclosure of Non-financial Information Act\n\nThe Disclosure of Non-financial Information Act is a Dutch regulation that made reporting on a number of non-financial themes compulsory for companies that qualify as large publicinterest entities ( grote organisaties van openbaar belang ) with more than 500 employees. These themes comprise environmental, social and labour issues, as well as anticorruption, bribery and human rights. For each of these themes, companies are obliged to report on the relevant policies, results, risks (including the management of these risks) and non-financial key performance indicators. The regulation also requires companies to describe their business models in their annual reports. We provide all of the information required in the relevant parts of this annual report. For transparency purposes only, the reference table in our sustainability supplement provides additional guidance on where to find this information.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative\n\nCommunicating transparently on our policies and results is an important element of sustainability. To ensure this, our annual report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. For further details, see the GRI content index on our website:\n\nvanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/reporting.\n\nFor more information about how we report on tax in accordance with GRI 207: Tax, see our 2022 tax transparency report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.\n\n## International Integrated Reporting Framework\n\nIn addition to the GRI Standards, we aim to apply the fundamental concepts and guiding principles of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. This annual report employs various elements of the framework, such as our value creation model and materiality matrix, and is partly structured around the types of capital identified by the framework (financial capital, manufactured capital, human and intellectual capital, natural capital and social capital). For more information, see integratedreporting.org/resource/ international-ir-framework.\n\n## External assessment\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's sustainability performance is assessed by a variety of external organisations.

As we have now completed our transformation from a universal bank to a specialist wealth manager, we introduced enhanced financial and non-financial targets for the medium and long terms.\n\n## 2022 for our clients\n\nThe reporting year 2022 was a difficult one for our clients, as almost all asset classes saw significant losses. Our job was to steer clients through troubled waters, soften the impact as far as possible, and continue to look out for their interests at all times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Private Clients\n\nOur Private Clients segment recorded very good net inflows in assets under management (AuM) of \u20ac2.0 billion. Our personal approach to client service combined with our expert bankers, distinctive offering to entrepreneurs, standout client experience and unique advisory proposition are what differentiate us from our competitors. Our performance in this segment tells us that our combination of personal advice and real solutions with modern technology and our sole focus on wealth management are working.\n\nOur clients continue to be satisfied with us, as evidenced by a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 36 for Private Clients (the same as in 2021), exceeding our target of 20.\n\n## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nWe had a successful year in the fiduciary management business, winning two large new mandates in 2022. The first was the KLM Cabin Crew pension fund, with almost \u20ac4 billion in AuM. The second was the BPF Schilders pension fund, overseeing the pensions of more than 100,000 members, with AuM of almost \u20ac8 billion. Overall, the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment showed a total net inflow of \u20ac11.6 billion in the reporting year.\n\n## Investment Banking Clients\n\nOur Investment Banking Clients segment had a robust year. Our strength lies in our focus on selected sectors: European real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech and infrastructure & renewables. In 2022, 37 transactions were completed at a total value of \u20ac8.1 billion in six jurisdictions.\n\nWithin our Equities department, we established a new Sustainable Opportunities team, with the aim of increasing our relevance to our global investor base. The team offers comprehensive investment research on companies and industries driving the transition to a sustainable future. The key to long-term value creation is investing in sustainable corporations and, by doing so, in a more sustainable world.\n\n| Key figures                                                 | 2022   | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|\n| Net result (\u20ac million)                                      | 84.3   | 143.8    |\n| Dividend per share (\u20ac)                                      | 1.75   | 2.00     |\n| Capital return per share (\u20ac)                                | 1.50   | -        |\n| Efficiency ratio, excluding special items  (%)              | 73.1   | 68.9     |\n| CET 1 ratio (%)                                             | 20.6   | 23.7     |\n| Return on average CET 1 based on  underlying net result (%) | 12.3   | 15.7     |\n| Balance sheet total (\u20ac billion)                             | 17.0   | 16.3     |\n| Loan portfolio (\u20ac billion)                                  | 9.4    | 8.9      |\n| Client assets (\u20ac billion)                                   | 124.2  | 131.2    |\n| Assets under management (\u20ac billion)                         | 107.8  | 115.6  1 |\n| Employees (FTEs at year-end)                                | 1,780  | 1,654    |\n\n## 2022 for our employees\n\nOver the course of 2022, we were able to grow our talented team. It's their dedication to clients, specialist approach and entrepreneurial spirit that allow us to deliver a unique proposition to our clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Van Lanschot Kempen, we aim for a diverse and inclusive culture. To further support this, in 2022 we launched our new inclusion and diversity policy, in which we outlined our vision on diversity and introduced five pillars (for more information, see \"Diversity in all its forms\" on page 32). We also signed the Declaration of Amsterdam as part of Workplace Pride.\n\nWe took significant steps to improve our brand as an employer in order to attract and retain talent in a tight labour market. This strategy paid off, as we were able to make a considerable number of new hires in 2022 despite these challenging conditions. To retain our employees, we also introduced a new employee share plan. We're proud that more than 70% of our employees are now shareholders in Van Lanschot Kempen as a result.",

        "page_content": "In summer 2022, we launched a long-term partnership plan for key senior employees, with the joint aims to anchor leadership more broadly in our organisation, encourage ownership and create more long-term alignment with our clients and shareholders.\n\n## 2022 for our shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn May 2022, we organised a Capital Markets Day to update stakeholders on the completion of our transformation from a universal bank into a specialist wealth manager. As we achieved our financial targets in 2021, we presented enhanced medium-term financial targets. For more information, see \"Enhanced financial targets\" on page 25.\n\nWe also shared our ambition for sustainable and profitable growth. Over the past few years, our AuM have added around 10% a year on average, reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance. Based on our growth plans and under normal market conditions, we'll be looking for comparable growth going forward, with a capital-light balance sheet.\n\nIn June 2022, we paid out the 2021 dividend of \u20ac2.00 per share (totalling \u20ac82 million). In December 2022, we returned excess capital to shareholders of \u20ac1.50 per share (totalling \u20ac61 million). In total, this means we paid out \u20ac3.50 per share.\n\n## Our business in Belgium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing our acquisition of a 70% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden in 2021, we made good steps in the collaboration process. Since October 2022, Van Lanschot Kempen in Belgium has been a custodian for Mercier Vanderlinden's clients. And some of our solutions in Belgium - such as Lombard loans - are already available to Mercier Vanderlinden's clients.\n\nIn December 2022, we announced the next step in our collaboration by accelerating the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. Their partners will become shareholders in Van Lanschot Kempen, with a significant holding that further anchors their commitment.\n\nThe combined company will continue under the name of Mercier Van Lanschot in the course of 2023.\n\nNet inflow in Belgium was \u20ac0.7 billion in 2022, of which \u20ac0.4 billion came from Van Lanschot Belgium and \u20ac0.3 billion from Mercier Vanderlinden's clients.\n\n## Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022 we set more ambitious targets to reduce carbon emissions across our business. Since our 2019 baseline, the carbon emissions of our own organisation have fallen by 40% per FTE. The carbon footprint per euro of our mortgage portfolio increased by 8.7% year on year, due to the colder weather in 2021 compared with 2020 (energy consumption data is only available one year later). The carbon footprint of our AuM went down by 17% per million euros invested. At year-end, the percentage of AuM in sustainable and impact investment solutions totalled 20.6%.\n\nIn addition, we focused on the publication of our first biodiversity policy and on updating our human rights policy. For more information, see \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" on page 36 and \"Human rights\" on page 42 respectively.\n\n## Recognition through awards and rankings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen was recognised for its work with several awards and rankings during the reporting year:\n\n- -We were awarded \"Best Private Bank in the Netherlands 2022\" at the annual Global Private Banking Awards by Professional Wealth Management and The Banker (publications from the Financial Times ). The jury said: \"Van Lanschot Kempen triumphed in the Netherlands category, against a backdrop where several much larger banks typically compete for the attention of high networth customers. Significant organic growth in managed assets was facilitated partly by the openness of the firm to partnerships and acquisitions in the Benelux region.\"",

        "page_content": "## The world around us\n\nThe economy, society and environment in which we operate as a wealth manager, the interests of our clients and prospects, what our competitors are doing, the state of the labour market and regulatory developments - all of these external factors have an impact on our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economy, society and the environment\n\nThe reporting year 2022 was a tumultuous one. The war in Ukraine that broke out in February had serious and farreaching consequences - not only for the people directly involved but across Europe and the world. Our sympathy goes out to all those affected by this tragedy.\n\nThe war caused a surge in energy prices, exacerbating an energy crisis that was already being felt at the end of 2021, and accelerating the deglobalisation trend. In Europe in particular, the focus changed quickly and dramatically from reducing our dependence on fossil fuels to prioritising energy security at all costs. Coal mines and nuclear plants that had previously shut down were reopened in a bid to ensure that Europe is no longer dependent on Russia for its energy. In the short term, this energy crisis evidently had a negative impact on Europe achieving its climate goals. In the longer term, however, the expectation is that the situation will accelerate the transition to renewable forms of energy.\n\nInflation also soared, in part due to the war in Ukraine, but also as a result of very loose monetary and fiscal policies by central banks and governments in the years prior, coupled with much faster than anticipated recovery in demand following the Covid pandemic. From a societal perspective, inflation has had more impact on lower income groups. Wage increases are not currently keeping up with inflation. Changes in fiscal policies, however, will have more impact on higher income groups: in the Netherlands and across Europe, the trend is for governments to shift from taxing labour to taxing wealth.\n\nThe reporting year saw the biggest hikes in key interest rates ever experienced in the eurozone, with the European Central Bank (ECB) deposit rate rising from -0.5% in January to 2% in December. This has had, and will continue to have, an impact on every aspect of the economy, from the housing market to savings. There was also major volatility in currency markets, with the dollar reaching parity with the euro in August before losing 50% of its gains later in the year. And in the UK, turmoil hit the markets in September 2022, when the new Prime Minister announced a 'minibudget' with large, unfunded spending increases. The Bank of England had to step in to stabilise financial markets. Two weeks later, a new Prime Minister was in office and the government had changed its budget plans.\n\nIn many respects, 2022 was unique: the deep and broad decline across almost every asset class, from equities to traditional fixed income, had an impact on the wealth of every investor - whether their portfolios were diversified or not. Clients suffered as a result, because the preservation of capital was virtually impossible: even savers lost money in real terms due to the impact of inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn the flip side, a certain amount of normalisation was inevitable on the back of several years of extremely low bond yields and strong growth. For the first time in years, fixed income as an asset class is now becoming a more viable option again.\n\nWith a recession potentially taking hold in 2023, the big questions are how deep it will be and whether inflation can be brought under control. In unstable times, what can be done to mitigate the risks from an economic, social and environmental point of view?\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Client interests\n\nGiven the economic turbulence of 2022, individual clients have broadly fallen into two categories. For some clients, the economic downturn offered an opportunity to invest money they've saved. For others, there's anxiety about the state of the economy - these clients are looking for some comfort in their portfolios. In all cases, clients are looking for a strong guardian for their investments.\n\nWe've also seen a shift in demand when it comes to asset classes: bonds are becoming increasingly attractive again, leading to higher demand for fixed income strategies. The search for illiquid alternatives continues, especially in times of economic stress: such alternatives can provide some comfort over the long term. Clients are also increasingly looking for active portfolio management, following a period when passive management was more popular.\n\nIn the fiduciary business, Van Lanschot Kempen focuses on the Netherlands and the UK - markets with distinctive characteristics. The UK is characterised by clients continuing to search for a fiduciary manager while UK pension funds still have room to consolidate. Meanwhile, the Netherlands has experienced consolidation of pension funds in the past, and all pension funds are now looking for support on major upcoming Dutch pension reforms.",

        "page_content": "Across all client groups, sustainability remains a key topic, especially given the energy crisis during 2022. Our clients whether private, wholesale, institutional or investment banking - increasingly expect their wealth to be managed in a sustainable way. And we need to go further and do better to ensure we meet these expectations. For more information about how we're serving all client groups and integrating sustainability into our solutions, see \"Our strategic pillars\" on page 18.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Competitive market\n\nFinancial institutions are competing more and more on their sustainability credentials, with added scrutiny from society on the definition of sustainability. And it's up to each financial institution to get its data right.\n\nTechnology continues to evolve, and our competitors evolve with it. A few years ago, the trend was to go fully digital. But that tide is now turning: the industry as a whole has realised that wealth management is a people business that requires the right balance between personal interaction and online convenience. At the same time, technology has become more agile, enabling financial services companies to change the way they work and respond more quickly to clients' needs.\n\nOne of the challenges for financial services companies is client due diligence: a necessary part of doing business that requires us and our competitors to collect a large amount of information about clients. Here again, having a personal relationship with clients is a key advantage: we understand our client segments very well. At the same time, we invest a lot of time and attention in ensuring we stay on top of our client due diligence process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Labour market\n\nThe labour market tightened further in 2022, with significantly more job openings than unemployed people. While this is the case across all sectors and at all levels of expertise, the talent war is particularly fierce in the digital, IT and finance sectors - bringing yet more competition when it comes to attracting professionals to our industry. In short, demand is outstripping supply, meaning that financial services companies are operating in an employee's market rather than an employer's market.\n\nWhen candidates can pick and choose, organisations need to work even harder to attract and retain talent. A competitive salary is no longer sufficient. Companies need to offer outstanding career development opportunities, as well as taking care of their employees' physical and mental wellbeing. People from Generation Z are starting to enter the workforce and their priorities are different from those of previous generations. They're looking for a healthier worklife balance and are more critical about whether a prospective company's core values fit with their own. They also tend to prioritise sustainability and look at the value a company adds to society.\n\nWith every trend and development pointing in the same direction, professional services companies like ours need to find more and better ways to attract the best people. And that means hiring external contractors as well as permanent employees - both internationally and in the Benelux region.\n\nFor more information on competition for talent at Van Lanschot Kempen, see \"Attracting, retaining and developing talent\" on page 31.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory landscape\n\nThe main regulatory impact in 2022 was felt in the sustainability sphere. The EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requires detailed disclosures designed to improve transparency around sustainable investment products. Such disclosures are required across multiple channels, including websites, prospectuses, annual accounts, client reports and terms & conditions.\n\nFurther to SFDR, additions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) have entered into force, which require financial institutions such as ours to ask clients about their sustainability preferences, in order to encourage investors to direct their capital towards sustainable investments. The Dutch regulator has also asked for more sustainability-related impact analysis and control frameworks on the basis of an ECB best practices document. And finally, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which enters into force in 2025 (covering the 2024 reporting year), will require additional disclosures from all listed companies relating to their environmental and social impact activities. In short: the number and depth of regulations is increasing rapidly. We're expecting more clarity on definitions and further regulations to follow.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Basel IV has been postponed; but when it does take effect, it will increase capital requirements in general for European banks. There are also new laws coming into play in relation to anti-money laundering and prevention of financial crime. Client due diligence and transaction monitoring continue to be a focus area: fulfilling compliance requirements is a necessity for all banks.\n\nFor more information about risks, regulations and compliance, see \"Risk and capital management\" on page 59.\n\n## Key risk themes for Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nIn addition to the trends and developments that impact our operating environment, as a wealth manager we face specific risks associated with our sector. In 2022, we identified the following key risk themes:\n\n- -Interest rate risk: higher and more volatile interest rates\n- -Operational risk: implementing change\n- -Compliance risk: increasing regulatory requirements for sustainability\n- -Sustainability risk: climate change\n\nSee 'Risk and capital management' (page 59) for more details.",

The overview below 1 outlines our assessment of these expectations.\n\n## Clients\n\nExcellent client experience, strong personal relationships, holistic advice, relevant and sustainable solutions and products, and risk-rewarding returns with reasonable terms and conditions\n\n## Employees\n\nInspiring and inclusive work environment, competitive salary, development and growth opportunities, and personal autonomy\n\n## Shareholders\n\nSolid performance, attractive returns and sustainable preferably growing - dividend\n\n## Governments/regulators\n\nPractices within the letter and the spirit of the law (e.g. duty of care, anti-money laundering, client due diligence, privacy regulations and Basel IV) and positive contribution to society and the environment\n\n## Other stakeholders\n\nFair business opportunities and positive contribution to society and the environment\n\n## How we assess materiality\n\nTo determine which topics are valued most by our stakeholders, we conduct a materiality assessment every two years, the most recent of which was in 2021. The starting point was a longlist of topics, derived from external standards and assessments. These were reduced to a shortlist by internal experts, based on which topics they considered could significantly impact or influence our stakeholders. This shortlist was approved by the Management Board, and formed the basis for a survey via which stakeholders were asked to assess the extent to which each topic influences the decisions they make regarding Van Lanschot Kempen. They were asked to indicate which five topics on the shortlist were most and least important to them when assessing our performance. In addition, a group of senior managers ranked the significance of the impact 2 Van Lanschot Kempen has via each of the topics. This ranking was subsequently cross-checked with a panel of external sustainability experts, after which it was discussed among the Management Board members prior to their approval.\n\nThe table and matrix overleaf show the 11 topics (out of the 20 in total) deemed most material. The table lists the topics in order of materiality. In the materiality matrix, the topics marked in bold indicate those deemed to be most material. These correspond with the topics listed in the table.\n\nThe Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards were recently updated to determine materiality based on an organisation's most significant impacts on the economy, environment and people, including human rights - corresponding to the horizontal axis of our materiality matrix. In line with this, we have added topic 2, \"Growth\", to the topics we consider to be material.",

We've defined specific client segments, which we serve in an integrated way via our combined business activities.\n\nAs part of our wealth management strategy, we established five strategic pillars that enable us to deliver on our ambition to generate sustainable and profitable growth, while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet, and to create both financial and non-financial value.

In this section and the next, you can read about how we fulfil our purpose - guided by our shared values, our sustainably entrepreneurial approach, and our strategic ambition and pillars.\n\n## Our licence to operate\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is the oldest independent financial institution in the Netherlands. Founded in 1737 in 's-Hertogenbosch, Van Lanschot Kempen has brought several entities together over time. Our ability to continuously adapt to the changing needs of our clients is what allows us to succeed, now and in the future.\n\nWealth is not just about financial resources; it encompasses everything that is valuable in life. It's about safeguarding our clients' heritage for generations to come - or starting to build that heritage. It's about pursuing growth or handing over a business that has been built over the years. It's about seizing opportunities and creating peace of mind. In short: it's about security, dreams, ambitions, wishes and decisions and all of these are specific to each individual.\n\nAt Van Lanschot Kempen, we're driven to understand the complete picture for our clients. We use our collective expertise and talents to present them with fitting solutions and products in support of their long-term goals.\n\n## Our sustainability approach\n\nThroughout our history, we have evolved and adapted to the changing world around us. We recognise that sustainability is an urgent need: we therefore see both a responsibility and an opportunity to achieve positive impact and returns over the long term for our clients and for society. To keep up the pace, we proactively engage with our clients and the companies in which we invest on their behalf. We aim to hold ourselves to the same standards that we ask from the companies in which we invest. We are sustainable entrepreneurs.\n\n## Our shared values\n\nOur values, and the behaviours that come with them, define what we do and how we do it. They unite us. They drive our decision-making process and our Code of Conduct. In 2022, we articulated four values to which we all subscribe:\n\n- -Personal : We invest in building long-term relationships. We're driven by our client's interests. We're proactive on their behalf. And our personal approach to the way we work with our clients also extends to the way we work with each other.\n- -Specialised : We love our craft. We work together with in-depth knowledge of specific sectors and disciplines. We're resourceful. We set the bar for quality high. And we aim to continuously learn and improve.\n- -Entrepreneurial : We're ambitious and results-focused. We anticipate and see opportunities - always aligned with the interests and goals of our clients. We believe in sustainable solutions. And we actively look for investments and initiatives that contribute to these.\n- -Decisive : We take a solutions-oriented approach. We aim to keep things as simple as possible. We're clear in our advice and our service offering. And we do what we say we're going to do.\n\nYou can read about how we put our values into practice in our daily work in the testimonials from employees throughout this annual report.\n\n## Our client segments and business activities\n\nWe have a clear focus on our client groups - and those we wish to attract. They include private clients, such as wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs, business professionals, charities, foundations and associations; wholesale and institutional clients, such as pension funds and other (retail) banks; and investment banking clients in our focus sectors (European real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech and infrastructure & renewables).\n\nWe combine our private banking activities with in-house investment management and investment banking expertise. We are active in several geographies: private banking in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland; investment management in the Netherlands, the UK and western Europe; and investment banking in western Europe and the US.\n\n## Our transformation\n\nIn 2022, we completed our transformation from a universal bank into a specialist wealth manager. Our organisation is large enough to matter yet small enough to be nimble. We have a clear ambition to be a leading wealth manager in the Benelux region, by focusing on sustainable and profitable growth while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet.\n\nThe transition to a unified brand - Van Lanschot Kempen illustrates our commitment to unlocking our full potential for our clients. We put our entire investment engine to work for all client groups: for example, by offering private clients access to the same in-depth research and tailored services as institutional clients.",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a well-capitalised, profitable, independent wealth manager with a strong specialist position in the market and deep Dutch roots. We believe that our knowledge and experience, our personal, client-focused approach and our unique combination of activities set us apart from our competitors in our selected market segments, while offering growth opportunities.\n\n## Our strategic ambition\n\nSupported by our strong client relationships, we aim to generate sustainable and profitable growth, while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet.\n\nOver the past few years, our assets under management (AuM) have added around 10% a year on average, reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance. Based on our growth plans and under normal market conditions, we'll be looking for comparable growth going forward.\n\n## Our strategic pillars\n\nEconomic, social and environmental shifts, evolving client interests, advances among our competitors, the labour market and regulatory changes all impact our operating environment. We are convinced we can remain successful by delivering on our strategic pillars:\n\n## Accelerate growth organically and inorganically\n\nTo remain relevant for our clients and accelerate our organic growth, we believe that we have to truly understand our clients, anticipate their needs and help them to fulfil their interests in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn addition to organic growth, inorganic growth is part of our strategy. We keep a keen eye on potential bolt-on acquisitions in the Dutch and Belgian private banking space, and in investment management in the Netherlands.\n\n## How we performed\n\nOrganic growth within our Private Clients segment has accelerated over recent years, with 2022 showing net inflows of \u20ac2.0 billion in AuM. These inflows are driven by disciplined client servicing as well as tailoring our offering to our clients' needs.\n\nOur Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment also showed good net inflows of \u20ac11.6 billion in AuM, driven by two large new mandates. The first was the KLM Cabin Crew pension fund, with almost \u20ac4 billion. The second was the BPF Schilders pension fund, overseeing the pensions of more than 100,000 members, with AuM of almost \u20ac8 billion.\n\nOver recent years, we've successfully expanded our activities with several bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships. Our high post-acquisition client retention rates show that clients value our proposition. In 2021, we acquired a 70% stake in the Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden. And in December 2022, we announced the next step in our collaboration by accelerating the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe partnership between Van Lanschot Belgium and Mercier Vanderlinden is progressing very well, as proven by the strong organic net inflow for both entities, the issuance of Lombard loans to Mercier Vanderlinden clients and the fact that we're now custodian for these clients.\n\nProfitability of the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment in 2022 was not in line with our ambitions. We will therefore focus on profitable growth for investment strategies in western Europe and for fiduciary management in the Netherlands and the UK, in the years ahead.\n\n## Advance through digitalisation and advanced analytics\n\nChanges in clients' needs and economic developments require us to respond quickly. Technology and digitalisation allow us to improve our productivity and service by speeding up processes, reducing operational errors and improving the availability, quality and interpretation of data. We've invested, and we'll continue to invest, heavily in our capabilities in this area. Digital interaction is crucial: it offers both clients and employees increased flexibility in terms of means of communication and the time needed to communicate. Digitalisation of management information is also crucial for our leaders, as it offers better agility when it comes to adapting to changing stakeholder expectations.\n\nTechnology is an integral part of how we provide service to our clients, while continuing to maintain a personal touch. We therefore give our clients the choice whether they want to communicate with us face-to-face, online or by phone. We also use technology to ensure that our communications are as individually tailored as possible - by using dashboards to gain insights into our clients' portfolios, for example.\n\n## How we performed\n\nAs part of our focus on improving the profitability of our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, we started a programme to accelerate improvements in the IT infrastructure within this segment. This programme is funded out of our normal running costs.",

        "page_content": "We invested in improving our banking app, a digital tool that aims to help our private clients gain insight into their accounts. Our clients awarded the app a score of 4.6 out of 5 on the App Store - indicating that they're very satisfied with the user experience.\n\nA good example of our progress on advanced analytics is our global real estate strategy, which is based on a data-driven investment process. The Advanced Analytics team supported the development of a quantitative approach to determine the relationship between building-quality factors and real estate company performance. This input supports better investment decisions.\n\n## Achieve our sustainability ambitions\n\nBeing a sustainable wealth manager with a long-term focus means that we proactively strive to prevent negative consequences for all stakeholders in line with the UN Global Compact, while aiming to create positive long-term financial and non-financial value. We can achieve the most significant social and environmental impact via our client investments. Our ambition is therefore to move towards more sustainable investing, together with our clients.\n\nWe're helping our clients navigate the fundamental transitions of this decade, such as the energy, food and materials transitions. We aim to find the opportunities in these transitions, avoid the pitfalls and help those companies that need improvement to make progress, by being active stewards on behalf of our clients.\n\nIn the future, we intend to raise the bar and make all investment categories more sustainable. To achieve this, we will leverage the drive and ambition that our employees already have in this area, while continuing to raise awareness across the whole organisation.\n\n## How we performed\n\nAs a wealth manager committed to net-zero emissions, we have set shorter-term ambitions as well as long-term ambitions to 2050. Starting in 2022, we enhanced our targets to reduce the carbon emissions from our investment funds and own operations by 7% per year (against a 2019 baseline).\n\nIn order to reduce the carbon footprint of our own organisation, we introduced a new, stricter travel policy and are in the process of switching our new lease cars to electric models. We are in proactive dialogue with our institutional clients to encourage them to commit to the net-zero goals of the Paris Agreement. We also engage with the management teams of our investee companies to urge them to play their part in the energy transition and set ambitious short- and medium-term targets.\n\nIn addition, we developed a biodiversity policy and updated our human rights policy in the reporting year. On an ongoing basis, we're also implementing the new EU sustainability regulations, such as the EU Taxonomy, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) level 2 and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).\n\n## Act as one to leverage our full potential\n\nIn order to unlock the full potential of our solutions-led organisation for our clients, we must be able to offer solutions that build on the knowledge and expertise of the entire group as well as our open architecture platform.\n\n## How we performed\n\nOur decision to move to a single Van Lanschot Kempen brand for all our business activities strengthens our positioning as a specialist independent wealth manager in the Benelux region. In 2022, we moved the first business activities to the new brand; the rest will follow in 2023.\n\nTo support working in a client-centric way, we serve all our client groups from our Client Management & Origination department. One example of operating across client groups is the collaboration between our Private Clients segment and our Investment Banking Clients segment. More and more clients are being referred - in both directions.\n\nIn summer 2022, we launched a long-term partnership plan for key senior employees, with the joint aims to anchor leadership more broadly in our organisation, encourage ownership and create more long-term alignment with our clients and shareholders. Currently, the partnership consists of the Management Board and 36 senior colleagues. A number of colleagues will be invited to join the partnership each year.\n\n## Attract, develop and retain the workforce\n\nOur people's knowledge, experience and professionalism are key to the way we operate. Investing in our people enables them to embrace both sustainability and new technology.\n\n## How we performed\n\nIn 2022, we strengthened our brand as an employer and increased our recruitment capacity. The number of vacancies that were filled during the year demonstrates that we're an attractive employer, while our growth strategy means that there are always new vacancies to fill.\n\nInclusion and diversity are important priorities for us. To support inclusion and diversity on the work floor, we launched some new initiatives and continued some of the activities started in 2021 - for example, the Inclusion & Diversity Community, signing the Declaration of Amsterdam from Workplace Pride, and the Van Lanschot Kempen Women's Network. Over recent years, the number of vacancies filled by colleagues with an international background has been increasing, which also helps to achieve more diverse teams.\n\nWe facilitate and encourage development and training of our existing workforce. With this in mind, in 2022 we implemented a new learning management system that will support our development plans.",

        "page_content": "## Our value creation\n\nAs a society, we need to find a sustainable equilibrium between people, planet and prosperity. That's why, at Van Lanschot Kempen, we aim to create value - not only financially but also for society and for the environment. For us, value creation means generating sustainable, long-term growth and maintaining long-standing relationships with our clients.\n\n## Our value creation per type of capital\n\nOur value creation model on the following page provides an overview of our inputs, outputs and impact via five types of capital identified by the International Integrated Reporting Framework. We improved and updated this model in 2022.\n\n## Inputs\n\nAs a wealth manager, Van Lanschot Kempen attracts various types of capital as inputs:\n\n- -Financial capital : The pool of funds available to our organisation with which to run our operations.\n- -Manufactured capital: The money entrusted to us by our various client groups.\n- -Human and intellectual capital: Our employees and external parties, who bring in their knowledge and expertise. The majority of our intellectual capital is embodied in our human capital; we therefore combine the two types of capital for reporting purposes.\n- -Natural capital: All natural resources that we directly or indirectly use via our operations, such as energy and water.\n- -Social capital: The network we have as an organisation and the trust that other stakeholders place in us.\n\n## Outputs and outcomes\n\nWe aim to deploy these types of capital in combination for overall value creation - meaning that we strive to add value via our business model, thereby increasing the total capital or value. Outputs can be both positive and negative:\n\n- -Financial capital: The pool of funds that we are able to redistribute to our stakeholders.\n- -Manufactured capital: The accumulated wealth of our clients that has been invested via our various products and services, and the loans that we provide to our clients.\n- -Human and intellectual capital: The hiring, training and development of our employees, as well as the impact on our staff in terms of work-related illness and the gender pay gap.\n- -Natural capital: The investment of our client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute to natural or environmental goals such as the energy transition and biodiversity. As a result of our investment of client assets and lending activities, however, there will be negative environmental outcomes under certain circumstances, such as waste production, pollution and carbon emissions.\n\n- -Social capital: The creation and preservation of growth and job opportunities for society, by passing on financial capital to companies and other organisations. We increase social capital by investing client assets in sustainable and impact funds that contribute to social goals, such as health and the food transition. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, and despite our policies and efforts, in some cases there may be negative social outcomes, such as on labour rights, human rights or other social issues in our supply chains.\n\nNote that input via one form of capital may be transformed into output via another form of capital. For example, financial capital inputs may lead to investment returns or home ownership (manufactured capital).\n\n## Impact on stakeholders\n\nWhen we put these various types of capital to work, this has an impact on our clients, employees, shareholders, bondholders and society. This impact may be positive (as indicated by the green bars in the value creation model) or negative (as indicated by the red bars).\n\nOver the next five sections, we define what each type of capital comprises, describe our approach to it, provide an indication of how we quantify our contribution, and offer concrete examples of how we create value.\n\n## Our focus on sustainability goals\n\nIn 2021, we defined three themes - climate change and biodiversity, living better for longer, and a smart and circular economy. In 2022, we recognised that these themes need to contribute to the three most important transitions of our age: energy, food and materials. Until now, we have been focusing our efforts on climate change and the energy transition. In the future, we intend to make meaningful progress on the food and materials transitions as well.\n\nWe aim to be a good corporate citizen by reducing the negative impact of our operations. As a wealth manager, we seek to act as a steward by helping our clients allocate their capital to organisations that are part of, or are well prepared for, these transitions. We are continually improving our products and solutions for our clients to make them more sustainable over time. We primarily offer three different types of investment solutions: responsible, sustainable and impact. All our products and solutions are responsible as a baseline: they meet UN and OECD guidelines on human and labour rights, and they meet governance and stewardship standards. We call this 'doing no harm'. Through our sustainable and impact investment solutions, we proactively focus on 'doing good' - aiming to create positive impact.\n\nFor examples of ways in which we're improving our products and solutions to become more sustainable, see \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" and \"Engaging on social issues\" on pages 36-44.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable and profitable growth\n\n## Financial capital\n\nWe define financial capital as the pool of funds available to an organisation for use in the production of goods or the provision of services. Funds can be obtained through financing, such as debt, equity or grants, or generated through operations or investments.\n\n## Our approach\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a specialist wealth manager with a capital-light balance sheet. Our profitability, growth and cost effectiveness are important to our clients, employees, shareholders and bondholders, governments/regulators and other stakeholders. We are aware that we have both direct and indirect impacts on the economy, environment and communities via our business: investing our clients' assets, increasing our assets under management (AuM) and managing our loan portfolio. We include more detail on these impacts and how we manage them under \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" and \"Engaging on social issues\" on pages 36-44.\n\n## Profitability versus growth\n\nStriking the right balance between profitability and growth is an ongoing priority. In our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment in 2022, we faced a dilemma: whether we should continue to grow, or whether we may need to accept that lower AuM is needed temporarily to increase profitability. At the same time, our focus on the long term means that we may need to accept lower profitability in the short term during adverse market circumstances and periods of high inflation. We continue to weigh up these factors carefully.\n\n## Enhanced financial targets\n\nHaving met our financial targets in 2021, in the reporting year we set enhanced medium-term targets in order to align with our growth ambitions:\n\n- -A Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio of 15% plus an M&A add-on of 2.5% for acquisitions, the latter offering enough scope for bolt-on acquisitions appropriate to our wealth management strategy. As announced in May 2022, we plan to return additional capital in excess of a 17.5% CET 1 ratio to our shareholders in both 2022 and 2023, subject to regulatory approval. At that time, excess capital amounted to \u20ac145 million;\n- -An efficiency ratio of 70%, reflecting our ambition to grow our revenues coupled with controlled cost growth;\n- -A 12% CET 1 return through the cycle;\n- -A dividend policy of 50-70% of underlying net profit\n- attributable to shareholders. This target is unchanged. These new targets were communicated at the Capital Markets Day in 2022.\n\nOver the past few years, our AuM have added around 10% a year on average, reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance. Based on our growth plans and under normal market conditions, we will be looking for comparable growth going forward.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of financial capital through a number of key performance indicators (KPIs):\n\n| KPIs                        | Targets                  | Performance in  2022   | Performance in  2021   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 1. CET 1 ratio              | 15% + M&A add-on of 2.5% | 20.6%                  | 23.7%                  |\n| 2. Return on equity (CET 1) | 12% through the cycle    | 12.3%                  | 15.7%                  |\n| 3. Efficiency ratio         | 70%                      | 73.1%                  | 68.9%                  |\n\n## Financial performance and risk management\n\nFinancial performance and risk management are key to our organisation, as all direct stakeholders benefit from a solid capital position and sustainable performance.\n\nIn 2022, our CET 1 ratio was 20.6%, down from 23.7% in 2021. This decrease reflects the introduction of steeper capital requirements for residential mortgages by De Nederlandsche Bank from 1 January 2022. We also returned excess capital to our shareholders of \u20ac1.50 per share (totalling \u20ac61 million) in December 2022, which impacted our CET 1 ratio as well.\n\nOur return on CET 1 stood at 12.3%, meeting our throughthe-cycle target. Our efficiency ratio amounted to 73.1%, above our medium-term target. For more details on our financial results, including the developments underlying this ratio, see 'Financial performance' on page 47.",

On the left-hand side, the capital deployed by Van Lanschot Kempen in our business model is listed, divided into separate categories. On the right-hand side, the capital generated is listed, also divided into categories. The items listed in the tables are intended as examples, and should not be used to calculate our overall value creation. We have not included totals in these tables because inputs and outputs of one type of capital can also be deployed and transformed into another type of capital.\n\nAs this table shows, our financial capital inputs consist mainly of our operating income and the capital received from shareholders and bondholders. Our financial capital outputs can, for the most part, be considered as redistribution of our revenues (for example, shareholder returns). For society at large, the main outputs relate to the taxes we pay.\n\nFor more information on the development of commission income, interest income and costs, see \"Financial performance\" on page 47.\n\n## Tax governance\n\nIn May 2022, Dutch employers' federation VNO-NCW presented the Tax Governance Code, which was drafted in consultation with internationally operating companies in the Netherlands. It drew on input from the trade union movement, NGOs, tax experts and academics. The Tax Governance Code aims to provide more insight into the tax strategy of large international companies and what they pay in the countries in which they operate.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has subscribed to the Tax Governance Code, thereby contributing to building trust in the tax system and in companies. For more information about how we report on tax, see our 2022 tax transparency report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOur strategy is to focus on sustainable and profitable growth while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. In the years ahead, we will continue to invest to achieve future growth. The profitability of the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment is a priority for us: we will focus on profitable growth for investment strategies in western Europe and for fiduciary management in the Netherlands and the UK, in the years ahead.",

It also includes the impact that we make via home ownership and mortgages.\n\n## Our approach\n\nCreating value, by putting the money entrusted to us by our clients to work, is our licence to operate. We take a personal approach, which differentiates us from the competition.\n\n## Wealth generation for our clients\n\nOur clients trust us to manage their wealth effectively and to make a positive contribution via our investment solutions. They expect risk-rewarding returns that enable the preservation and growth of their financial assets, in a sustainable way.\n\nOur wealth management solutions and investment strategies should also perform well compared with their benchmarks. To achieve this, we have set up professional investment processes that focus on long-term value creation for our investment strategies and the portfolios of our private and institutional clients. Each of our investment strategies uses a process that is best suited to take advantage of the opportunities in its respective sector.\n\nIn line with our values, our portfolio managers have the freedom to create and manage a strategy that is in line with their clients' interests as well as our own investment beliefs. These portfolios bring together the collective expertise from teams that focus on investment strategies, manager selection and portfolio management.\n\nEach team plays a pivotal role in the investment process, governance (including clear responsibilities) and optimum use of systems and tools, in order to achieve the most positive outcomes.\n\nIn addition to comparing the relative financial returns of our managed propositions against that of their respective benchmarks, we assess the quality and relevance of our solutions via external assessments (for example, Morningstar analyst ratings and sustainability globes). We consider the sustainability performance of our products to be directly linked to the long-term preservation and growth of capital, and an integral element of the quality and relevance of our solutions. Via our assets under management (AuM), we have an indirect impact on the economy, environment and communities - and these factors have an impact on our long-term performance. We include more detail on these impacts and how we manage them under \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" and \"Engaging on social issues\" on pages 36-44.\n\n## Long-term sustainability versus short-term returns\n\nDelivering sustainable value is part of our purpose, and this sometimes presents a dilemma: on occasion, we need to ask ourselves whether it's acceptable to sacrifice higher returns on a client's investments for the sake of sustainability. In 2022, some asset managers started re-directing money to oil and gas because of the energy crisis. Despite the potential for short-term gains, we concluded that in the interests of long-term sustainability, this was not an avenue we wanted to pursue.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of manufactured capital through the key performance indicator (KPI) shown below:\n\n| KPIs                                                           | Targets     | Performance in  2022   | Performance in  2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 4. Three-year relative performance of our managed propositions | > benchmark | 0.2%                   | n/a                    |\n\n## Return on assets under management\n\nOur wealth management solutions aim to deliver positive performance in the long term, with our investment strategies performing well against their benchmarks. In 2022, the three-year average performance of our managed propositions relative to their benchmarks stood at 0.2%, meeting our target to outperform the benchmark. These figures are calculated by comparing the year-end absolute performance of our three largest discretionary solutions over the last three years with their respective benchmarks.",

Our manufactured capital outputs consist mainly of investment returns for our clients, and the financing we arrange for them.\n\n## AuM and investment returns\n\nOne of the ways in which we help our clients preserve and create wealth is by introducing them to new asset categories that they might otherwise not have access to. For example, in 2022 we introduced the Private Real Estate Pool for our private clients.\n\nDespite turbulent markets, clients continue to entrust us with their funds because we're able to offer them the right solutions and put their interests front and centre, as proven by total net inflows of \u20ac13.7 billion in AuM in 2022. We saw strong new inflow of AuM within our Private Clients segment, which was well spread across the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland. And we were awarded two large new pension fund mandates in our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, of almost \u20ac4 billion and almost \u20ac8 billion respectively.\n\nInvestment return is a material topic for our clients. The three-year average return amounted to -\u20ac2.9 billion overall, with 2020 and 2021 adding positive returns for our clients. However, 2022 was a difficult year across almost all asset classes. For example, pension holders saw large losses and may not have the long-term horizons required to wait for the next upturn. Our bankers needed to stay even closer to their clients in order to guide them through the bear markets.\n\n## Residential mortgages\n\nBy providing mortgages, we help our clients purchase homes and thereby create various forms of value. We estimate the increased personal wealth of our Dutch clients due to home ownership (compared with renting a property) at \u20ac375 million in 2022. Within this estimate, we take into account the interest costs, tax benefits linked to mortgage interest deduction, real-estate taxes for home owners and increases in housing prices - compared with a reference scenario in which our mortgage clients would rent a property.\n\nWe attribute the increased personal wealth due to home ownership to the \"clients\" stakeholder group.\n\nIn general, home owners invest more in home improvements. This represents a boost to the building and construction sector, which we estimate to be worth \u20ac10 million in 2022. We attribute this value to the \"society\" stakeholder group.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tax benefits extended to home owners via the mortgage interest deduction scheme reduce tax income for the Dutch government, in comparison with the reference scenario in which our clients would rent a property. We estimate this loss in tax income at \u20ac32 million in 2022, and attribute this to the \"society\" stakeholder group.\n\n## Other loans\n\nThe other loans portfolio comprises loans to high net-worth individuals as well as commercial loans that fit into our private clients relationship model, such as loans to healthcare clients, family businesses and business professionals. Through these business loans, we facilitate economic activities that in turn boost other economic activities via the so-called multiplier effect. Using inputoutput modelling, we estimate the total economic impact of these loans to be approximately \u20ac1,665 million.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn line with our strategy, we continue to aim for investment returns for our clients that are above the benchmarks.\n\nOur goal is to keep our mortgage portfolio stable, which could be challenging in 2023 because of increasing interest rates. Despite lower prepayments, in general these higher interest rates are also driving less business.\n\nWe aim to better support our clients in making their homes more sustainable. Currently, our Groenhypotheek (green mortgage) solution offers lower interest rates to clients financing measures to make their homes more energy efficient. In 2023, we will enhance this proposition for clients buying or refinancing homes: the higher the energy efficiency, the lower the interest rate for the client.",

        "page_content": "## Engaging our employees\n\n## Human and intellectual capital\n\nWe define human capital as people's competencies, capabilities and experience; their motivation to innovate; and their ability to understand our clients' needs, collaborate with their colleagues and lead by example. We define intellectual capital as organisational, knowledgebased intangibles, including specific expertise and intellectual property.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn a knowledge and service-based organisation such as ours, people make all the difference. Their professionalism, skills and engagement determine the quality of our service and client experience. We believe that well-trained, knowledgeable people provide better service to our clients and are more engaged. And the extremely tight labour market in 2022 made the need for strong recruitment and retention practices more important than ever.\n\n## Attracting, retaining and developing talent\n\nOur strategy is to be an attractive and inclusive employer for the talent available in the labour market. We continuously strive to recruit a diverse range of talented professionals. Instead of looking for individuals on a case-by-case basis, our aim is to create a continuous flow of new talent.\n\nIn 2022, we therefore focused on our employer branding and attractiveness as an employer, increased our recruitment capacity, and took significant steps on inclusion and diversity. We implemented a new learning management system - our Van Lanschot Kempen Academy - that will support our development plans. We also aligned our labour conditions and policies across the board - updating our travel policy and working abroad policy, to name just a couple.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of human and intellectual capital through a number of key performance indicators (KPIs):\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                  | Targets                                            | Performance in  2022    | Performance in  2021    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 5.

This is a strong outcome and a sign that employees feel connected to the organisation. The eNPS is a method used to measure employee satisfaction with, and loyalty to, our organisation. It's based on the percentage of employees who are promoters of the organisation, minus the percentage of employees who are detractors.\n\nDuring the reporting year, we carried out our annual employee engagement survey and we held one pulse survey. The response rate was 81% for the annual engagement survey and 76% for the pulse survey.\n\nOur engagement score remained unchanged for 2022 at 88%, slightly higher than the financial services industry benchmark of 87%. And our score on inclusion and diversity also remained unchanged at 88%. Outcomes for specific questions about growth and retention indicate that career development in particular requires our attention. The results of the survey also indicate that our internal processes and our ability to move quickly from idea to implementation can be further improved.\n\nIn the reporting year, we started tracking our employees' experience at two key points: after the first 90 days of working at Van Lanschot Kempen and on leaving the company. Exit interviews showed that the most cited reason for leaving is a perceived lack of career development and growth opportunities (see \"Employee development\" on page 34). Whereas after the first 90 days of employment, many employees feel that their team made sure they felt welcome, they were provided with the information they needed and they had made the right choice when accepting the job.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nOur commitment to inclusion and diversity goes hand in hand with our ambition to positively contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive world. In 2022, we launched our updated inclusion and diversity policy, in which we outline our vision. In short, we firmly believe that we need to foster an inclusive workplace where everyone's unique contributions are valued and where we optimise our combined talents. Our willingness to gain new perspectives, value differences and adapt to change is instrumental in making diversity work for us.

        "page_content": "## Diversity in all its forms\n\nWe aim for diversity not only in terms of gender, nationality, age, educational background, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, ethnic background, disability or distance to the labour market, but also across personal experiences, characteristics, socio-economic backgrounds and the different skills that people bring. We recognise the value of bringing diverse perspectives to the table, and realise it takes time to learn and adapt in order to get there. In line with this, we are committed to ensuring we take steps to attract, develop and retain a diverse range of talent.\n\nAs part of our inclusion and diversity policy, and in consultation with numerous internal and external stakeholders, we defined five pillars (see graphic below) to enable us to work towards and achieve our ambitions to add value for our clients, employees, shareholders and society as a whole. We elaborate more extensively on the initiatives related to each pillar in the Appendix of our policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we further embedded inclusion and diversity in our core HR processes and activities, with a particular focus on our recruitment and selection processes. In terms of gender diversity, we aim for 50% male and 50% female in our inflow across all levels. To support the business in achieving this balance, we put a number of additional recruitment-related measures in place:\n\n- -We use labour market insights and deploy talent sourcing for specific roles.\n- -We established new partnerships with agencies and networks focusing on female talent.\n- -We offer flexible hours and working conditions.\n\nThe results of these extra efforts are evident when we compare the inflow of female employees year-on-year. At year-end 2022, this was 8 percentage points higher than at year-end 2021: up from 34% to 41%.\n\nIn line with the Ingrowth Quota and Target Ratios Act that took effect on 1 January 2022, we also aim for a minimum of 30% women and 30% men in the three levels immediately below the Management Board (senior staff) - see KPI 8. To achieve this target, we drafted concrete action plans in collaboration with the business and our Management Board, which were presented to our Supervisory Board. For instance, when it comes to recruiting for senior staff positions, we mandate that:\n\n- -The final recruitment shortlist should be 50% male and 50% female.\n- -The Management Board must approve appointments for positions immediately below Board level.\n\nRegarding through-flow, we apply the principles that:\n\n- -Female promotions should be proportional to the total percentage of the female population of the company (2022: 33%).\n- -The internal pipeline should be activated through talent reviews, succession planning and workforce planning.\n\nTo maintain continuous awareness of our target for senior staff, and to foster commitment to achieving our shared action plan, the topic of gender diversity is regularly discussed within our business unit management teams.\n\nAt year-end 2022, the gender balance among senior staff was 17.9% female, which represents an improvement of 2.8 percentage points compared with year-end 2021, though well below our target of 30%.\n\n## Reducing the gender pay gap\n\nIn 2021, we reported a corrected gender pay gap of 4%. During the 2021 end-of-year compensation calibration, we took steps to address individual outliers. For 2022 - using the same approach and methodology as in 2021 - we reported an unexplained corrected pay gap of 2.7%, above our KPI target range of <2%.\n\nIn the reporting year, we ran a project to collect additional variables - including educational background and work experience - to understand whether our pay gap could be further explained. Keeping all other inputs constant, the resulting corrected pay gap remained at 2.7%.\n\nInternally, the steps we are taking to further reduce the pay gap include addressing outliers in the end-of-year compensation calibrations; running a new-hire calibration; and addressing gender biases within our inclusive leadership sessions for managers.\n\nExternally, we contributed to a roadmap - compiled by WOMEN Inc. - that other companies can follow to start addressing their own gender pay gaps. By contributing to this initiative, we hope to make positive steps towards closing the gender pay gap in the Netherlands.

We aim to add value to these human capital inputs through our business model - for example, by creating attractive jobs that result in additional social value for our employees. However, such outputs can also be negative - as in the case of work-related illnesses.\n\n## Opportunity costs of work\n\nEconomists have developed various methods to assign a monetary value to the time employees spend working. These methods all have pros and cons. A downside to many methodologies is that they are not based on a reference scenario in which employees conduct other paid work. Since employees generally require an income to maintain their livelihoods, this would be more valid than comparing the average monetary value an employee assigns to one working hour with one leisure hour.\n\n## Social value of having work\n\nNumerous studies show that people with a job are more satisfied with their lives than people without one. Several of these studies also focus specifically on quantifying this social value, usually by means of a \"well-being valuation\". Through this econometric method, developed to measure the value of so-called non-market goods, we can determine the monetary value of increased life satisfaction as a result of having a job.\n\nBased on estimates of the value that employees attach to their work beyond their remuneration, the social value of all jobs at Van Lanschot Kempen in 2022 amounted to \u20ac20.9 million - attributed to employees - compared with \u20ac19.1 million in 2021. For our calculations, we use a generic estimate from a study by Fujiwara 1 and apply different valuations for employees aged up to 30, between 30 and 50, and over 50.\n\n## Work-related illness\n\nIn contrast to the social value of having work, the negative impact of work-related illness on employees' quality of life is also reflected in our contribution to human capital and social value. To calculate this, we use the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) method developed by the World Health Organization. A DALY is an international measure of missed happiness in life due to illness. In short, every healthy year of life counts for 1 DALY, and the DALY is lowered for each year in which an employee is ill by using a weighting factor.\n\nWe combine this data with illness-related absentee data for the average Dutch employee (from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment - RIVM) and the value of one year of life (from CE Delft, an independent research organisation) to calculate the total impact. Based on this calculation, the total negative impact from arm, neck and shoulder complaints, back pain and burnout in 2022 amounted to \u20ac1.7 million, compared with \u20ac1.6 million in 2021.\n\n## Other achievements and developments\n\n## Hybrid working\n\nPost-pandemic, hybrid working (partially from home, partially from the office) became the new normal. However, it has also given rise to some dilemmas.\n\nOn the one hand, the flexibility of working from home is much appreciated by colleagues, and many people have seen an increase in productivity and a better work-life balance. On the other, we were faced with a new challenge: how to maintain a strong company culture and stay connected while physically in different places. Studies have also shown that employees who are more visible in the office are more likely to be promoted, which can unfairly disadvantage employees who prefer working from home. And the feeling of needing",

        "page_content": "to be \"always on\" can be particularly pervasive when working from home, which can impact employees' work-life balance and overall well-being. From a client perspective, wealth management is a people business, and the personal touch is what differentiates us from our competitors - so meeting people face-to-face is valuable.\n\n## Employee development\n\nCareer development is cited as one of the most important priorities for employees, as evidenced by our engagement surveys and exit interviews that show this is an area for improvement. At the same time, the quality of our workforce has a direct impact on the experience of the clients we serve. In 2022, we therefore launched both a programme to develop our leaders at strategic and operational levels, and a programme to support managers in successfully managing their teams.\n\nWe organised more than 50 team workshops in 2022 using Management Drives interventions, with more than 750 individual profiles created. The focus of these workshops is on better understanding the diversity of perspectives that each individual brings to a team.\n\nOver the course of the reporting year, we updated our Private Banking Academy with new modules. The Academy was recognised by the Federation of Financial Planners, meaning all private bankers who graduate will be admitted to the Certified Financial Planners register. We also implemented a new learning management system that will support our growth and development ambitions going forward.\n\n## Sustainable employment policies\n\nFollowing the introduction of several benefits in 2021, we brought in a number of policies during 2022 that were designed to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\nSince the pandemic, we and our clients realised that we no longer need to travel as much as we used to in order to work together effectively. In light of the considerable impact on the environment, we have set guidelines to limit our travel to those occasions when the added value outweighs the environmental impact, and not to fly when travelling any distance less than 700 kilometres.\n\n## Employer brand\n\nIn 2022, we took significant steps to improve our brand as a potential employer, in order to attract and retain talent in an extremely tight labour market. We launched a new employer branding campaign: Jouw talent is ons vermogen (\"Your talent is our asset\").\n\nIn the reporting year, we also launched a new employee participation plan, known as the Matching Share Plan: each Van Lanschot Kempen share that an employee buys - up to a maximum value of \u20ac2,500 - is matched by Van Lanschot Kempen. The plan offers an attractive investment opportunity in Van Lanschot Kempen, as well as the chance to share in the company's successes. We are proud that more than 70% of our employees are now also shareholders in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Partnership for leadership\n\nIn summer 2022, the Van Lanschot Kempen Partnership was launched: a long-term participation plan for key senior employees. Its purpose is to anchor leadership more broadly in the organisation, further promote ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, and create more long-term alignment with our shareholders and clients.\n\nAs the partnership is a participation plan, partners are asked to make a minimum individual contribution of at least \u20ac50,000 in year one and to increase their total contribution to a minimum of \u20ac150,000 and a maximum of \u20ac500,000 over the course of five years (with a minimum contribution of \u20ac25,000 per year). Contributions can be made either in cash or through conversion of a participant's (net) fixed remuneration in shares in the respective year. Shares have a lock-up period of five years, allowing Van Lanschot Kempen to provide a discount of 18.5% on the shares bought.\n\nThe individual contributions are collected in a so-called f onds voor gemene rekening (FGR - fund for joint account). Partners' contributions remain in this fund during their full tenure as a partner. This structure has been selected to combine the shares as one voting block and to reflect the collective and collaborative nature of the partnership. In return for their contribution, partners receive FGR units, each corresponding to a share in Van Lanschot Kempen. When votes are cast on the shares held by the FGR, voting instructions are obtained from the partners. In the absence of such instructions, the FGR will either abstain or allow individual partners to vote according to their own discretion. The partnership does not affect the governance and management structure of the company.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2023, we will implement a company-wide through-flow process, including a KPI to monitor the vacancies that are filled by internal candidates. We will also further upgrade our Van Lanschot Kempen Academy.",

        "page_content": "## Reducing our carbon footprint\n\n## Natural capital\n\nWe define natural capital as all renewable and non-renewable environmental resources that support the prosperity of an organisation. Natural capital includes air, water, land, minerals, forests, biodiversity and ecosystem health.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn recent decades, society globally has used up too much natural capital and not reinvested enough, causing adverse effects. For instance, the large-scale use of fossil fuels is an important cause of climate change. To limit these harmful effects, society and the global economy need to transition to more sustainable consumption patterns and business models. As a wealth manager, we seek to act as a steward by helping our clients allocate their capital to organisations that are part of, or are well prepared for, these transitions. Furthermore, as an organisation, we impact natural capital through our daily operations, for which we consume energy, water and other inputs that harm the environment. We aim to lead by example, by reducing the impact of our own operations.\n\nIn the reporting year, we focused on the implementation of our climate change policy and progress against the corresponding targets. As a result, we made less progress on biodiversity preservation than we were initially aiming for.\n\n## Enhanced non-financial targets\n\nWe've been working to limit climate change for well over a decade, continuously enhancing our policies and approach. Having met our previous targets, in 2022 we set more ambitious targets across our business:\n\n- -Reduce direct carbon emissions via our own organisation by 7% per FTE per year, against 2019 baseline;\n- -80% of funds and discretionary management solutions to comply with 7% average annual emission intensity reduction, against 2019 baseline;\n- -Grow coverage of the assessment of the carbon footprint of our assets under management (AuM) to 55-60% of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by end 2022;\n- -Reduce indirect carbon emissions via our mortgage portfolio per euro invested compared with previous year.\n\nIn addition, we have expanded the scope of our previous target for our private clients' AuM invested in sustainable and/or impact solutions, to all AuM invested in these solution categories. And we have set targets for the sustainability rating of our Kempen funds and the percentage of AuM in internal and external funds/mandates on the approved list that meet our basic sustainability criteria.\n\nFor more details on the KPIs and targets relating to our natural capital impact, see overleaf.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nGiven the size of our AuM, the biggest environmental impact we make relates to how we invest our clients' money. We therefore have an extensive responsible investment policy in place for all AuM. This policy has been developed and implemented internally, and is based on a long-term, focused\n\ninvestment philosophy coupled with an active ownership approach. We believe that an actively managed investment portfolio creates the most value in the long term, in both financial and non-financial (environmental, social and governance - ESG) terms.\n\nWe engage with fund managers and investee companies on a broad range of ESG topics, including environmental issues, and we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings (AGMs). If fund managers or investees are not willing to comply with our minimum environmental standards, we may choose to divest. In addition to our responsible investment approach, we offer sustainable solutions. These contain more exclusion criteria, take a best-in-class approach and focus on creating positive impact.\n\n## Engagement versus divestment\n\nAs the world is now over two years into the critical decade in the fight against climate change, we increasingly face a dilemma: whether to continue to engage with oil and gas companies or to divest. Although alignment with the Paris Agreement is important for all companies, we believe the oil and gas sector in particular plays an essential role in the energy transition, and we therefore urge oil and gas companies to be at its forefront. Over the last two years, many oil and gas companies have increased climate change reduction ambitions - though not yet enough to align with the Paris Agreement. Through engaging with these companies, we hope to convince them to further raise their ambitions, thereby realising real-world impact.\n\nAt the same time, we're aware that the returns on many lowcarbon solutions, such as wind energy, are lower than on oil and gas, and do not fit well within the current risk profile of energy companies. We're also aware of the energy supply crisis affecting much of the world right now. Both of these factors make it challenging for oil and gas companies to increase the availability of low-carbon solutions and set production targets aligned with the low-carbon energy mix needed to limit global heating to +1.5\u00b0C.\n\nWe aim to address this dilemma by cooperating with likeminded investors. Together with a group of other Dutch asset managers, in 2022 we published two statements urging oil and gas companies to increase their ambitions and prove their commitment to the Paris Agreement. In cooperation with these peers, we have set a two-year time limit within which we want to see significant progress. If insufficient progress is made, we will consider further actions, such as filing shareholder resolutions or divesting.\n\nYou can read more about how we weigh up this dilemma and fulfil our responsible investment approach in our upcoming Stewardship and Sustainable Investment Report.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable banking\n\nOur banking activities are underpinned by our sense of corporate social responsibility. Our client due diligence policy supports sustainability, and we have a responsible lending policy in place.",

Currently, our Groenhypotheek (green mortgage) solution offers lower interest rates to clients financing measures to make their homes more energy efficient. In 2023, we will enhance this proposition for clients buying or refinancing homes: the higher the energy efficiency, the lower the interest rate for the client.\n\n## Acting as a good corporate citizen\n\nWe want to lead by example, which is why we aim to continuously reduce the environmental impact of our own operations as well. To further reduce our carbon footprint in 2022, we adopted a new lease car policy and a new travel policy. As a result, we are in the process of switching our new lease cars to electric models, and we limit the number of business flights we take.

The relatively low carbon footprint compared with previous years in part still reflects the impact of pandemic-related measures that were implemented in 2021, as carbon emissions data generally has a slight delay. For a large part, however, this reflects portfolio changes: our AuM are increasingly in sustainable investments, which have lower carbon intensities. We see this development in both the Private Clients and the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segments. For instance, 59% of our fiduciary management clients have adopted Paris Agreement-aligned benchmarks (KPI 13.b.ii), already achieving our 2023 target.\n\nCoverage of the assessment of the carbon footprint of our AuM decreased to 56%, nonetheless meeting our 2022 target (KPI 13c). This decrease was mainly due to a relative shift within our AuM to more illiquid asset classes, for which less information is available on their carbon footprint. The carbon footprint of our AuM is partially determined by that of our own funds and discretionary management solutions. For these solutions, we have set a target to reduce emissions\n\nby an average of 7% per year (against a 2019 baseline). This reduction roughly aligns with that needed to achieve the central ambition of the Paris Agreement and the reduction prescribed by the EU climate benchmarks. At year-end 2022, 88% of our funds and discretionary management solutions met this target.\n\nWe also engaged with 54 out of the 55 top 50% most carbon-intensive companies in the portfolios of our Kempen funds, to encourage them to integrate climate risks and opportunities into their long-term business models and to enable them to thrive in the transition to a low-carbon economy (KPI 14c). We divested from the remaining company for non-climate change-related reasons.\n\nThe total indirect emissions per euro of our mortgage portfolio increased by 8.7% year on year, due to the colder weather in 2021 compared with 2020 (energy consumption data is only available one year later). While, on average, the energy-efficiency rating of the collateral for our residential mortgages improved. The total carbon footprint of our mortgage portfolio in 2022 increased to 28,726 tonnes CO2e. The carbon footprint as disclosed in this annual report",

In contrast, in our 2021 annual report, only 2019 energy consumption data was available.\n\nTo monitor our progress against our target to reduce indirect emissions via our mortgage portfolio (KPI 13d), we apply the methodology prescribed by the Dutch chapter of the Platform Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), with some specific deviations. In collaboration with other parties, we contributed to the development of the PCAF score 3 methodology, whereby the carbon footprint of our residential mortgage portfolio is 101,221 tonnes CO2e. This difference is primarily due to the fact that, under this methodology, we do not correct for the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and because this methodology takes into account the floorspace of the homes financed.\n\nIn our own organisation, absolute carbon emissions in 2022 totalled 2,775 tonnes, or 1.45 tonnes per FTE (2021: 1,984 tonnes, or 1.10 tonnes per FTE). The increase is mainly due to the lifting of pandemic restrictions in early 2022 in our countries of operation. Despite the increase, we remain on track to reduce the carbon emissions of our own organisation by at least 7% per FTE per year, against a 2019 baseline. More information on the environmental impact of our own operations can be found in our sustainability supplement: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.\n\n## Sustainability ambition\n\nIn 2022, 20.6% of our AuM were invested in sustainable and impact investment solutions. We aim to increase this by 5 percentage points per year (KPI 14a). By year-end 2022, we had screened 58% of our AuM (2021: 57%). Of these screened assets, 33% were invested in sustainable investment solutions and 3% in impact investment solutions (2021: 25% and 2% respectively).\n\nIn 2022, the percentage of internal and external funds/ mandates on our approved list that met our basic sustainability criteria was 95% (KPI 14b).\n\n## Active ownership\n\nIncluding our engagements with the top 50% most carbonintensive companies in our Kempen funds, we conducted direct engagements for change with 165 individual companies on a wide range of ESG issues. In addition to these direct engagements, we conducted 196 collaborative engagements with companies and 39 dialogues with external fund managers.\n\nWe also use our voting rights in line with our engagement activities. In 2022, we voted at 427 meetings, or 96% of all votable meetings (2021: 437 meetings, 96%). We voted \"abstain\" or \"against\" on at least one item at 73% of these meetings.\n\nIn general, the objective of these engagements is to encourage investee companies to address ESG issues and further contribute to the transitions that are needed to move to more sustainable economies and societies. One of our engagement successes was with Czech utility company CEZ, one of the ten largest listed utility companies in Europe. CEZ's main activities are the generation, distribution, trade and sale of electricity and heat, trade and sale of natural gas, provision of energy services, and coal mining. A significant part of the energy that it generates and distributes comes from coal-fired power - making it one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG) in Central Europe. However, in part due to our engagement, CEZ has set and started to implement an ambitious climate change mitigation strategy. In a press release, CEZ recognised the role that we and other Climate Action 100+ lead engagers have played here.\n\nMore information on our active ownership activities can be found in our upcoming Stewardship and Sustainable Investment Report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The EU Taxonomy provides a common classification system by which economic activities, loans or investments that facilitate these activities are considered \"green\". Our disclosure is limited to \"eligibility\" as opposed to \"alignment\", in accordance with regulations, because investee companies are only obliged to report on how their activities were aligned with the EU Taxonomy as of 1 January 2023 over full-year 2022. Like other financial institutions, we will therefore report on our EU Taxonomy alignment in 2023 when information on the alignment of our investee companies becomes available.\n\nBy marking assets on our balance sheet as \"EU Taxonomyeligible\", we denote that these have been earmarked as \"potentially green\" because they help to limit or mitigate the consequences of climate change.\n\nAt year-end 2022, \u20ac8,027 million out of our total \u20ac17,059 million in assets on our balance sheet were EU Taxonomy-eligible. This corresponds to 47% of total assets on our balance sheet being exposed to EU Taxonomyeligible economic activities, and 53% not being exposed to such activities. The share of assets on our balance sheet that is not eligible comprises the categories that are not in scope for the EU Taxonomy: 21.1% of total assets on our balance sheet is exposed to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers; 3.1% comprises derivatives; and 18.8% is exposed to undertakings that are not obliged to publish non-financial information pursuant to the NonFinancial Reporting Directive (NFRD).\n\n| Summary of EU Taxonomy eligibility of activities                           | Total gross carrying  amount (\u20ac million)   |   Total assets  (%) | GAR assets  (%)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Exposures to EU Taxonomy-eligible economic activities                      | 8,027                                      |                47.1 | 59.7              |\n| Exposures to EU Taxonomy-ineligible economic activities                    | 4,448                                      |                26.1 | 33.1              |\n| - of which exposures to undertakings that are not in scope of the NFRD     | 3,201                                      |                18.8 | 23.8              |\n| Derivatives                                                                | 532                                        |                 3.1 | 4.0               |\n| On-demand interbank loans                                                  | 93                                         |                 0.5 | 0.7               |\n| Other assets not eligible for green asset ratio (GAR) calculation          | 347                                        |                 2   | 2.6               |\n| Total GAR assets                                                           | 13,447                                     |                78.8 | 100.0             |\n| Exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational  issuers | 3,592                                      |                21.1 | -                 |\n| Trading portfolio                                                          | 19                                         |                 0.1 | -                 |\n| Total assets                                                               | 17,058                                     |               100   | 100.0             |\n\nOur EU Taxonomy-eligible assets on the balance sheet comprise our mortgage portfolio, mortgages distributed by third parties, positions in residential mortgage-backed securities, exposures to a residential mortgage fund, and eligible positions in Van Lanschot Kempen funds in which we invest via our own book: \u20ac8,027 million in total. As a consequence of our wealth management strategy, and compared with other financial institutions, we have a relatively limited portfolio of other loans. This portfolio\n\ngenerally comprises products that are supplemental to our private banking relationship model - for instance, loans provided to family businesses, business professionals, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs. In the main, these counterparties are not marked as public interest entities - i.e. are not covered by the NFRD - and for this reason, these loans are not in scope for the EU Taxonomy.",

By comparison, the natural capital inputs that we use - such as energy and water - are limited and are therefore not reported. Van Lanschot Kempen's primary inputs come from financial capital streams, and are transformed into natural capital outputs.\n\n## Client investments in sustainability-labelled equity funds\n\nAs shown in the table above, the natural capital alignment of all our sustainability-labelled equity funds in aggregate (\u20ac731 million) is estimated at \u20ac32.6 million (2021: \u20ac7.3 million). If the \u20ac731 million had been invested in benchmark funds instead, the natural capital alignment would be estimated at -\u20ac67.2 million (2021: -\u20ac111.7 million).\n\nOur calculations were based on company sales data per investee, indicating which portion of sales could be linked (positively or negatively) to a set of natural and social themes, provided by a data vendor. Adding up the sales numbers for the natural themes resulted in the total contribution to natural capital. Although we recognise that this aggregation may result in a product or service of an investee being attributed to more than one (natural or social) theme, we do not expect this to materially influence the final outcome of our analysis. The main reason is that our aggregation is conducted both for positive and negative impacts, and consequently smooths out the potential for double-counting.\n\n## Carbon footprint of our AuM, balance sheet and own organisation\n\nStarting in 2022, we made progress on expressing the impact of the carbon footprint associated with our AuM, balance sheet and own organisation in monetary terms. It's widely acknowledged that our current level of carbon emissions will have a profound impact on society in the longer term, in the form of climate change and all its likely effects. Various institutions have estimated the costs for future generations to address these effects - with the most generally accepted estimate so far being provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Based on this, we estimate the costs of our carbon footprint at approximately \u20ac468.6 million (AuM), \u20ac17.9 million (balance sheet) and \u20ac0.5 million (own organisation) in 2022.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOur focus will be on helping our clients navigate the energy transition and challenging our investee companies to adapt faster to that transition. In 2023, we will step up our strategic engagement efforts and urge companies to bring forward their ambitions and actions regarding the energy transition. Furthermore, we will start implementing our biodiversity policy.\n\nMore information on the natural capital alignment of our sustainable investment funds can be found in our upcoming Stewardship and Sustainable Investment Report.\n\nfor which we know the EPC have a rating of A or higher. In 2022, we were able to assess the EU Taxonomy eligibility of our positions in a selection of our own investment funds.\n\nWe aim to embed sustainability considerations into all of our products and services. We work continuously to improve the sustainability profile of our current investment products and to develop new sustainable investment products. Over time, this should translate into increased EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment of the assets on our balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Engaging on social issues\n\n## Social capital\n\nWe define social capital as the relationships within and between groups of stakeholders. In our case, social capital includes the social impact we make via the assets of our clients.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe preserve and create wealth, growth and job opportunities for society by passing on financial capital to companies and other organisations. Our relationship with clients is one of our most important assets. We increase social capital by investing client money in sustainable and impact funds that contribute specifically to social goals, such as living better for longer. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, in some cases there may be negative impacts in our supply chains - for example, relating to labour rights, human rights or other social issues.\n\n## Responsible and sustainable investment\n\nAs with natural capital, the biggest social impact we make relates to how we invest our assets under management (AuM). Our responsible investment policy therefore also covers social issues extensively. We engage with fund managers and investee companies on a broad range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics, including human rights and labour rights, and we exercise our voting rights at annual general meetings (AGMs). If fund managers or investees are not willing to comply with our minimum social standards, we may choose to divest. In addition to our responsible investment approach, we also offer sustainable solutions. These contain more exclusion criteria and a bestin-class approach. For a full description of our ESG policy (including our voting policy and voting records), see vanlanschotkempen.com/esg-policy.\n\nLiving better for longer is one of our sustainability focus themes. In 2022, we published our vision statement on this theme, outlining how we aim to contribute to the food transition, thereby helping society at large to live longer and in better health.\n\n## Investing in weapons versus exclusion\n\nIn 2022, we faced a dilemma that was triggered by the geopolitical situation in which the world found itself. While controversial weapons have always been on our exclusion list, conventional weapons were not. Some of our clients, even before the war in Ukraine, wanted to exclude all weapon-producing companies; we provided them with a solution. However, because of the war, a growing number of clients want to continue investing in conventional weapons. This confirms our current policy: when defence is necessary, investing in weapons can also be seen as necessary. We will evaluate our weapons policies in 2023.\n\n## Human rights\n\nIn the reporting year, we also updated our human rights policy. The revised policy is much more comprehensive and explains how we seek to respect international human and labour rights in every role we play. The policy summarises our commitments to monitor and increase the level of responsible business conduct, and respect and adhere to the\n\nhuman rights of all stakeholders, in terms of the organisations that we invest in, the businesses we finance, our business partners and our own operations. As any significant negative impacts are expected to be a consequence of the operations of investee companies, we aim to ensure access to appropriate remediation for local stakeholders by engaging with these companies.\n\nOur human rights policy is based on our commitments to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and a range of International Labour Organization and UN conventions. It stipulates how we conduct due diligence, apply the precautionary principle and respect human rights. This includes forbidding child labour, forced labour, human trafficking and discrimination, as well as respecting freedom of association, equal remuneration, the right to collective bargaining and other rights. The policy has been approved by our Sustainability Board and adopted throughout our operations. Implementation of the policy is the responsibility of the business, and of members of our Sustainability Investment Council and Sustainability Council Loans and Own Organisation. Our integrated human rights policy is available on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en/ sustainability/policy.\n\n## Client experience\n\nAs a wealth manager, our success and that of our clients is grounded in our ability to provide easy-to-access, seamless customer journeys via various channels (e.g. app, face-toface, phone) and the right services and solutions at the right time, leading to high levels of client satisfaction. By doing so, we better help our clients achieve their long-term (financial) goals. We continuously work on improving our client experience - for instance, by improving our apps - and enhancing our product and service offering. We assess the quality of our clients' experience via the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and the number of repeat clients. Through the services we provide to clients, we indirectly impact the environment and communities.\n\n## Ethics and integrity\n\nThe financial sector is built on trust, and a healthy culture and ethical behaviour are needed to sustain this trust with all our stakeholders.\n\nThe Banking Code, with which we comply, sets out principles for sound and controlled business operations, corporate governance, risk management policies, and audit and remuneration policies. As stated in the Banking Code, the Management and Supervisory Boards are responsible for developing and maintaining standards of integrity and ethical behaviour.\n\nOur Code of Conduct, to which every employee must adhere, goes further than complying with relevant legislation. It includes guidelines on how employees should act with integrity and balance the interests of all stakeholders. Our Code also includes the Banker's Oath, which all our employees are required to sign. For more information, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance.",

Over the course of 2022, internal and external training programmes took place, focused on connecting and empowering ambassadors to be sustainability challengers within their teams.\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of social capital through a number of key performance indicators (KPIs):\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                                                                           | Targets                                                  | Performance in  2022      | Performance in  2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 15.

To measure their satisfaction and loyalty, we use the NPS, which provides insight into client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points, the higher the better. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6. The NPS that we measure is also known as Relationship NPS. We measure this four times a year for Private Clients and Evi van Lanschot, and once every two years for Wholesale & Institutional Clients.\n\nIn 2022, our private clients 2 awarded us an NPS of 36, higher than our target of 20 and the same as in 2021. This can be attributed to our proactive approach in talking to our clients, especially during times of increased market uncertainty.\n\nThe NPS for Evi van Lanschot fell to -1 in 2022, lower than our target of 10 and down from our 2021 score of 15. The NPS for Evi van Lanschot was impacted by disappointing absolute results on clients' investment portfolios.\n\nFor the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, we measure the NPS once every two years, as the relationships with - and solutions provided to - institutional clients do not change as quickly as can be the case with private clients. The most recent NPS of 38 awarded by wholesale and institutional clients in 2021 was above our target of 20.\n\nAmong our Corporate Finance clients, building long-term client relationships is measured via the percentage of successful transactions with repeat clients during a year. A client is defined as a repeat Corporate Finance client if they have made a successful transaction with us in the past five years. The score on this KPI indicates whether existing clients are doing business with us again, as well as our ability to acquire new clients. In 2022, 78% of transactions were with repeat clients, above our target range of 50-60%. This indicates client loyalty is high and shows that our clients value the quality of the services we provide.\n\nThe quality and relevance of the services we offer our Securities clients is measured through the number of interactions we have with our institutional clients. In 2022, the number of interactions (indexed against a 2020 baseline) stood at 103 - falling short of our target of 130, because of our focus on launching our sustainable opportunities offering in 2022.",

        "page_content": "A crucial element in our relationship with clients is the extent to which their expectations are met by the quality and effectiveness of our solutions. The quality of our investment strategies is measured via the average Morningstar rating of these strategies in the institutional share class. At year-end 2022, our strategies were awarded 1 gold, 1 silver and 4 neutral ratings, which is down from the Morningstar ratings we held at year-end 2021 - and therefore not meeting our target.\n\n## Active ownership\n\nActive ownership is one of the pillars of our responsible investment approach. Through engagement and voting, we aim to use our influence as an investor to improve corporate policies and/or behaviour on specific ESG issues. In 2022, we conducted 106 engagements for change. Half of these engagements included a governance and/or social element. For 30 of these engagements, we achieved at least one milestone in the past year, meeting our target to achieve at least one milestone for 10-15 engagements per year.\n\nOne of these engagements was with Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube. We had already reached out to Alphabet in 2019 due to concerns about the company's lack of transparency on human rights and the board's lack of oversight of these issues. To advance these discussions, in 2020 we co-filed a resolution for Alphabet's AGM. Since then, the company has developed policies on the issue and established a board-level committee to monitor human rights risks.\n\n## Quantifying our value creation\n\n## Overview of social capital: inputs and outputs\n\n| Input (\u20ac million)                            | From   | Amount  2022   | Amount  2021 Output (\u20ac million)                       | For   |   Amount  2022 |   Amount  2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n| Social capital input has not been quantified |        |                | Client investments in sustainable  equity funds (AuM) | S     |           37.4 |           48.6 |\n\nS: society\n\nAs this table shows, our main impact on social capital - both positive and negative - is via the products and solutions we provide. We currently only quantify the impact we make via our client investments. Our social capital inputs consist of private clients, Evi clients, fiduciary mandates and investment banking transactions, but we do not quantify these in monetary terms.\n\n## Client investments in sustainable equity funds\n\nAs with natural capital, we quantified the social capital outcomes of our clients' assets. Based on our assessment, our sustainable equity funds in aggregate over 2022 (\u20ac731 million) made a net positive contribution of \u20ac37.4 million to seven social themes 3 . If the \u20ac731 million had been invested in the benchmarks of these sustainable equity funds instead, the social capital alignment would be estimated at \u20ac31.7 million.\n\nMore information on the social capital alignment of our sustainable investment funds can be found in our upcoming Stewardship and Sustainable Investment Report.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn 2023, we will continue to use our influence to improve the corporate behaviour of our investee companies on social issues. We will publish new policies on living better for longer, and on a smart and circular economy, in 2023. In doing so, we will contribute more to the food and materials transitions. We expect the positive impact of these to become more meaningful in 2024.\n\nAt the 2022 AGM, we submitted a second resolution along with other shareholders, asking Alphabet to conduct an independent human rights impact assessment. The resolution received strong support from Alphabet's shareholders. We will continue to engage with Alphabet on this issue and monitor the company's progress.\n\n## Ethical behaviour\n\nOur approach to ethical behaviour is described at the beginning of this section. We monitor whether our employees positively rate our culture regarding ethical behaviour and integrity via employee surveys. Employees are asked to evaluate whether we operate with integrity in both our internal and external dealings, and if they feel they could report dishonest or unethical practices without fear of reprisal. The outcome is benchmarked against other financial services firms (by an external organisation) and was above the industry average at the end of 2022, in line with our target.\n\nIn 2022, two ethical incidents were reported (2021: two incidents), which have since been handled according to the relevant policies and procedures.",

We aim to make the largest possible positive impact on people who need our help, by supporting community projects in financial education, healthier living, cultural education and social cohesion through sports. The overarching new theme of the Foundation aligns with Van Lanschot Kempen's purpose and the Sustainable Development Goal for a sustainable living environment.\n\nAn important feature of our Foundation activities is that we always seek to combine a financial donation with the - pro bono deployment of Van Lanschot Kempen staff. Employees can spend eight working hours per year on Foundation activities. In this way, we hope to make a positive impact on society as well as on our employees. Participation in Foundation activities connects our staff to new people and unfamiliar situations, resulting in new experiences and energy.\n\nWith the pandemic abating in 2022, we were able to resume our in-person activities - for example, at De Spelen Rotterdam and Amsterdam through NL Cares, financial education in classrooms, Onbegrensd Avontuur and Voedselbank Amsterdam. We also engaged employees by collecting winter clothes for people in Ukraine affected by the war.\n\nFor further details on the Foundation and its annual report, see vanlanschotkempen.com/en/vlkf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEver since its inception in 1737, Van Lanschot Kempen has been committed to doing business with respect for the world around us and with an eye for future generations. We believe that wealth is more than money. Art and culture are part of Van Lanschot Kempen's DNA. Supporting art, artists and museums is one way that we, as a wealth manager, can contribute to the preservation and creation of our cultural heritage.\n\n## Our main cultural sponsorship activities are as follows:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen is the main sponsor of Het Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. This five-year partnership fits with our focus on preserving and creating wealth in the broadest sense of the word.\n- -Van Lanschot Private Banking became partner of the Grachtenfestival. This four-year partnership is the result of successful collaboration between the festival and our company since 2019.\n- -Van Lanschot Private Banking is partner of the Van Gogh Museum.

This three-year partnership connects the worlds of sport, business, science and culture, and focuses on sharing knowledge.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen is a partner of the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award. This programme supports entrepreneurs as they unlock their ambitions, by recognising entrepreneurial achievement among individuals and companies.\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen and Nyenrode Business University signed a five-year partnership introducing the Chair in Family Businesses and Ownership Dynamics. The goal is to gain more knowledge about how the dynamic between owners materialises, how it can be further developed in a sustainable way, and how it affects the company as well as society.\n- -Since the beginning of 2023, Evi van Lanschot has been sponsoring four-time world champion and Olympic medallist Marit Bouwmeester on her journey to the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.",

We propose a dividend of \u20ac1.75 per share for 2022 (2021: \u20ac2.00 per share).\n\nThe decline in net result compared with 2021 was caused by several factors. Firstly, special items increased due to the acceleration of the acquisition of the remaining stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. Secondly, income from securities and associates fell as a result of lower valuation gains and book profits compared with 2021. Thirdly, 2021 saw higher releases in impairments due to reversed impairments on participating interests.\n\nAt the same time, both commission income and interest income were up by 6%, while operating expenses rose in line with planned growth in FTEs.\n\nClient assets declined to \u20ac124.2 billion (2021:\n\n\u20ac131.2 billion), and our assets under management (AuM) dropped by 7% to \u20ac107.8 billion. This was driven by a negative market performance of \u20ac21.5 billion. The net inflow in AuM was strong, with \u20ac2.0 billion in our Private Clients segment and \u20ac11.6 billion in our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment.\n\n- 2 Full-year 2022 and 2021 including retained earnings; half-year 2022 excluding retained earnings.\n- 3 Return on average Common Equity Tier 1 capital is calculated based on underlying (annualised) net result.",

Securities commissions increased by 6%, driven by higher income from management fees. Despite the negative market performance, average AuM volumes were higher throughout 2022 than in 2021. Volumes benefited from the net inflow in AuM in both our Private Clients and Wholesale & Institutional Clients segments, as well as from the effect of a full year of Mercier Vanderlinden's contribution, given the addition from July 2021 onwards. Other commissions increased, mainly as a result of Corporate Finance deals in our Investment Banking Clients segment.\n\nAnnualised recurring securities commission (run rate) was at a lower level compared with year-end 2021, because of the decline in AuM. Annualised recurring fees are determined by multiplying the AuM on the reporting date by the management fee per client to determine the expected annualised management fee, assuming the AuM remains unchanged. The expected annual transaction fees relating to these client portfolios are then added to this number.\n\nAnnualised run rate securities commission income (\u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interest\n\n| Interest (\u20ac million)                      |   2022 |   2021 | H2 2022   |   H2 2022 |   H1 2022 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Clean interest margin                     |  159.2 |  141.2 | 13 %      |      92.1 |      67.1 |\n| Loan commission                           |    1.7 |    2.9 | -42 %     |       0.9 |       0.8 |\n| Early redemption fees                     |    5.8 |   13.3 | -56 %     |       1.8 |       4   |\n| Miscellaneous interest income and charges |   -4   |   -3.9 | -4 %      |      -1.8 |      -2.3 |\n| Interest                                  |  162.7 |  153.6 | 6 %       |      93   |      69.7 |\n\nThe reporting year saw a significant increase in key interest rates in the eurozone, with our net interest income benefiting from interest rate rises in the second half of 2022. Our 2022 interest income of \u20ac162.7 million was up 6% on the \u20ac153.6 million achieved in 2021.\n\nIn comparison with year-end 2021, the total interest margin (12-month moving average) fell by 4 basis points to an average of 94 basis points. Since the second half of 2022, however, margins have bottomed out and started to increase. The 'clean interest margin' even increased by 3 basis points compared with its level at the end of 2021, to 95 basis points at the end of 2022.\n\nPrivate Clients' 2022 commission income amounted to \u20ac270.4 million (2021: \u20ac244.4 million). The increase is partly due to the full year of Mercier Vanderlinden's contribution (an increase of \u20ac16.7 million compared with 2021). Private Clients' margin on AuM increased slightly to 63 basis points in 2022 (2021: 62).\n\nWholesale & Institutional Clients' 2022 commission income amounted to \u20ac78.4 million, which represents a decline from 2021 (\u20ac81.4 million) because the latter included a one-time performance fee of \u20ac5.5 million, while 2022 included \u20ac0.9 million in performance fees. The margin for the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment remained stable at 12 basis points in 2022 (the same as in 2021).\n\nThe Investment Banking Clients segment performed well in 2022, with commission income of \u20ac56.0 million at a slightly higher level compared with 2021 (\u20ac55.3 million). The commission income of Corporate Finance and Equity Capital Markets (ECM) deals was \u20ac44.7 million (6% higher than in 2021) on the back of multiple deals, driven by strong performance in mergers & acquisitions (M&A) in particular.",

        "page_content": "## Savings\n\nAfter more than a decade of low and even negative interest rates, the European Central Bank (ECB) began raising the deposit rate, from -0.5% in July to 2% in December. As a result, margins on savings rapidly improved over the course of the year. We stopped charging negative interest on large deposit balances in October 2022. And for private clients who invest with us, we offer a wealth management arrangement: the size of a client's investment portfolio determines the extent to which they can hold savings at more favourable interest rates.\n\n## Loans\n\nNet interest income on mortgages declined and early redemption fees decreased further, driven by fewer prepayments as interest rates rose. The decrease in lending margin is partly offset by higher income on hedge derivatives related to the mortgage portfolio and growth in our total loan portfolio of \u20ac0.5 billion to \u20ac9.4 billion.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\n| Income from securities and associates (\u20ac million)   |   2022 |      | 2021   |   H2 2022 |   H1 2022 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Dividend                                            |    4.4 | 10.9 | -60 %  |       2.5 |       1.8 |\n| Realised capital gains                              |    7.2 | 19   | -62 %  |       0   |       7.2 |\n| Valuation gains and losses                          |   -3.7 | 36.1 |        |      -0.9 |      -2.8 |\n| Income from securities and associates               |    7.8 | 65.9 | -88 %  |       1.6 |       6.2 |\n\n| Income from, and book value of, securities and associates  (\u20ac million)   |   Income  2022 |   Income  2021 |   Book value  year-end 2022 |   Book value  year-end 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Van Lanschot Participaties (minority interests)                          |           10.1 |           36.5 |                        47.8 |                        52.2 |\n| Bolster Investment Co\u00f6peratief UA                                        |            6.3 |            3.9 |                        63.1 |                        51.3 |\n| Co-investments in own products                                           |           -8.6 |           23   |                       123.3 |                       202.3 |\n| Other equity investments                                                 |            0.1 |            2.6 |                         2   |                         1.7 |\n| Total from securities and associates                                     |            7.8 |           65.9 |                       236.2 |                       307.5 |\n\nIncome from securities and associates relates to investments of our equity investment company, Van Lanschot Participaties, and our investment in Bolster Investments Co\u00f6peratief UA. We also take positions in our own investment funds - for instance, by providing seed capital or in order to align with our clients' interests.\n\nIn the first half of the year, a participation interest owned by private equity fund Newion I - in which we invest - was sold. This resulted in a book profit of \u20ac7.1 million.\n\nValuation gains and losses declined by \u20ac39.8 million to -\u20ac3.7 million in 2022, reflecting the positive results in our private equity portfolio and lower results in our own investment funds compared with 2021.\n\nThe total result of our own investment funds worked out at \u20ac2.9 million (2021: \u20ac13.2 million), consisting of -\u20ac8.6 million on our own investment funds and \u20ac11.5 million on hedges. The hedges are reported under Result on financial transactions. The book value of our own investment funds decreased due to negative market performance and the divestment of own investment funds.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\n| Result on financial transactions (\u20ac million)   |   2022 |   2021 |      |   H2 2022 |   H1 2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|-----------|-----------|\n| Result on securities trading                   |   -0.1 |    1.7 |      |       0.8 |      -1   |\n| Result on currency trading                     |   11   |    8.7 | 27 % |       6.9 |       4.1 |\n| Result on investment portfolio                 |   -3.2 |    3   |      |      -3.1 |      -0.1 |\n| Result on hedges                               |   14.1 |  -20.7 |      |       2.1 |      12   |\n| Other income                                   |   -0.4 |   -3   | 85 % |      -1.3 |       0.8 |\n| Result on financial transactions               |   21.3 |  -10.3 |      |       5.5 |      15.8 |\n\nThe main driver of the improved result on financial transactions is a positive turnaround of the result on hedges, which comprises a positive result on futures of \u20ac11.5 million. Futures are used to manage our risk appetite relating to our investments in our own investment funds. In addition, a \u20ac9.3 million positive result is due to hedge accounting ineffectiveness, predominantly because of derivatives used for macro fair value hedge accounting that have been applied to our mortgage portfolio. The ineffectiveness is primarily caused by differences in discount base (Euribor versus euro short-term rate - ESTR) and pay-out frequency between the swap and the underlying asset.\n\nLastly, a \u20ac6.2 million negative hedging result applies to our structured products activities (2021: -\u20ac4.6 million). The derisking of the structured products portfolio was completed by year-end 2022.\n\nTrading activities in currency and securities are the result of client facilitation only - providing liquidity to clients.",

Firstly, the acquisition of Mercier Vanderlinden led to an increase in staff costs of \u20ac4.9 million compared with 2021. Secondly, our workforce grew by 126 FTEs to 1,780 FTEs (2021: 1,654 FTEs), in particular within the IT and Compliance functions as well as in the teams responsible for investment solutions. Similar to 2021, staff costs also included a one-off payment to employees, amounting to \u20ac4.4 million (\u20ac2,600 per employee) in the Netherlands.\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses were relatively stable at \u20ac123.5 million (2021: \u20ac119.7 million), taking into account that the acquisition of Mercier Vanderlinden led to an increase in other administrative expenses of \u20ac2.1 million compared with 2021.\n\n## Efficiency ratio\n\nThe efficiency ratio - i.e. the ratio of operating expenses (excluding costs incurred for special items) to income from operating activities - amounted to 73.1% (2021: 68.9%). This higher ratio was mainly driven by lower income from securities and associates.\n\n## Impairments\n\n| Impairments (\u20ac million)          |   2022 |   2021 | H2 2022   | H2 2022   |   H1 2022 |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Addition to loan loss provisions |   -7.7 |  -11.7 | 34%       | -0.5      |      -7.2 |\n| Other impairments                |    1.1 |   -6.5 |           | -         |       1.1 |\n| Impairments                      |   -6.6 |  -18.1 | 63%       | -0.5      |      -6.1 |\n\n## Addition to loan loss provisions\n\nIn 2022, the release from our loan loss provisions amounted to \u20ac7.7 million, driven by a few client files.\n\nAt year-end 2022, the management overlay amounted to \u20ac5.2 million (year-end 2021: \u20ac1.6 million), based on a calculation through which macroeconomic sensitivities and scenarios were applied at client level. This management overlay aims to reflect real-world behaviour of our clients and the economic circumstances and uncertainties, which are not (fully) captured by the models. For more information about the management overlay, see Section 3.8.7, 'Management overlay', in the financial statements.\n\nIn 2022, the release from loan loss provisions relative to average risk-weighted assets worked out at a release of 19 basis points (2021: release of 29 basis points).\n\n## Other impairments\n\nOther impairments of \u20ac1.1 million in 2022 comprise an impairment on one of our office buildings. In 2021, other impairments showed a release of \u20ac6.5 million. This amount was a reversal of impairments on participating interests, taken in earlier years.\n\n## Non-strategic investments\n\nWe currently hold one non-strategic financial investment, Allshare. The operating profit before tax from this nonstrategic investment amounted to \u20ac0.6 million in 2022. The 2021 result of \u20ac4.8 million was impacted by the sale of Holonite, which contributed \u20ac3.1 million in operating profit before tax of non-strategic investments.",

Due to this acquisition, the amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions increased from \u20ac11.3 million in 2021 to \u20ac14.9 million in 2022. Initially, we agreed to acquire the remaining 30% of the shares at the beginning of 2025 and 2026. However, in December 2022 we agreed to accelerate the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. This leads to an adjustment in the valuation of the contingent liability of +\u20ac18.6 million, to be recognised under expenses related to the accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden. Expenses related to this line item would otherwise be recognised in future years.\n\nBased on the agreed transaction structure, IFRS requires the full consolidation of Mercier Vanderlinden at the time of the acquisition of the 70% stake. As a consequence, certain elements from the transaction will need to be treated as profit & loss items until the full acquisition. In our 2022 results, the following costs are included in expenses related to the accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden:\n\n- -Interest costs (for the accrued time value of money) and staff costs relating to the liability, totalling \u20ac12.0 million\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n| Earnings per share (\u20ac million)                                        | 2022   | 2021   |       | H2 2022   | H1 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net result                                                            | 84.3   | 143.8  | -41 % | 36.1      | 48.2      |\n| Share of non-controlling interests                                    | -0.1   | -0.1   | -97 % | -0.1      | -0.1      |\n| Share of holders of AT1 capital securities                            | -6.8   | -6.8   | 0 %   | -3.4      | -3.4      |\n| Net result for calculation of earnings per ordinary share             | 77.4   | 137.0  | -43 % | 32.6      | 44.8      |\n| Earnings per ordinary share (\u20ac)                                       | 1.90   | 3.35   | -43 % | 0.80      | 1.10      |\n| Underlying net result for calculation of earnings per  ordinary share | 110.9  | 153.1  | -28 % | 53.6      | 57.3      |\n| Underlying earnings per ordinary share (\u20ac)                            | 2.72   | 3.74   | -27 % | 1.32      | 1.40      |\n| Weighted number of outstanding ordinary shares (x 1,000)              | 40,706 | 40,910 |       |           |           |\n\nShare of holders of AT1 capital securities relates to the coupon of the \u20ac100 million Additional Tier 1 bond we issued in March 2019. These securities qualify as Tier 1 capital when determining capital adequacy.\n\nWe propose paying a 2022 cash dividend to Van Lanschot Kempen shareholders of \u20ac1.75 per share, with a pay-out ratio of 67% based on the underlying net result attributable to shareholders (2021: \u20ac2.00, pay-out ratio of 53%).\n\nThe pay-out ratio based on the net result attributable to shareholders amounts to 96% (2021: 60%). In 2023, new shares will be issued as a result of the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden, subject to regulatory approval. These still-to-be-issued shares have been taken into account in determining the pay-out ratios.\n\n(as we agreed on a discount if one of the partners were to leave prior to 2025 or 2026) (2021: \u20ac5.5 million);\n\n- -Given the negative market performance in the first half of 2022 in terms of AuM and profitability, the estimated cost at 30 June 2022 for the final purchase in 2025/2026 had decreased by \u20ac1.0 million.\n\nIn 2021, we made a provision of \u20ac3.3 million under a compensation scheme for the repayment of excess interest to (former) clients with variable-rate revolving consumer credits. Over the course of 2022, we concluded that the pool of clients impacted and size of the compensation payable had decreased since the provision had been made. As a result, \u20ac2.0 million in provisions were released in the second half of the year.\n\nOther one-off charges amounted to \u20ac6.5 million, mainly related to a settlement of an interest rate derivatives case for which we had taken a provision of \u20ac9.9 million in the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax for 2022 amounted to \u20ac34.7 million (2021: \u20ac34.6 million), which translates to an effective tax rate of 29.1% compared with 19.4% in 2021. Our effective tax rate is higher than the general Dutch tax rate of 25.8%, primarily due to the expenses related to the accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden, which are not tax deductible.",

The net inflow in AuM was strong at \u20ac2.0 billion, achieved across the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nAt the end of 2022, discretionary assets under management accounted for 52% of total AuM (2021: 54%), amounting to \u20ac21.3 billion, while non-discretionary assets under management made up 38% of total AuM (2021: 36%), amounting to \u20ac15.3 billion. Total AuM also includes the positions of our private clients invested in our investment strategies (\u20ac4.0 billion).\n\nIn Belgium, we saw continued good net inflows of \u20ac0.7 billion in 2022, achieved by Van Lanschot Belgium (\u20ac0.4 billion) and Mercier Vanderlinden (\u20ac0.3 billion). However, the negative market performance led to a decline in overall AuM to \u20ac9.2 billion (2021: \u20ac9.7 billion). Total client assets amounted to \u20ac10.4 billion (2021: \u20ac10.7 billion).\n\n## AuM Private Clients (\u20ac billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Evi van Lanschot proposition is part of the Private Clients segment. In 2022, Evi van Lanschot's AuM fell by 17% to \u20ac1.3 billion (2021: \u20ac1.6 billion) as a result of negative market performance combined with \u20ac7 million in net outflow.",

        "page_content": "## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nThe Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment's AuM fell to \u20ac67.3 billion, due to a negative market performance of \u20ac15.2 billion, partly offset by net inflows of \u20ac11.6 billion.\n\nInvestment strategies saw a net outflow of \u20ac0.2 billion. This was driven by credit strategies and real asset strategies, and was only partially offset by inflows in small-cap strategies.\n\nFiduciary management showed a net inflow of \u20ac12.0 billion, primarily from two new fiduciary mandates: BPF Schilders pension fund (of almost \u20ac8 billion) and KLM Cabin Crew pension fund (of almost \u20ac4 billion). In the UK, AuM decreased to \u20ac4.8 billion (2021: \u20ac8.0 billion) due to the combination of a net outflow of \u20ac0.1 billion and a negative market performance.\n\nIn 2022, we introduced asset class solutions (ACS) as an AuM category. ACS is a total solution for clients to invest in illiquid asset classes - for example, European private debt or direct lending. The solutions comprise both Van Lanschot Kempen funds and third-party funds. Previously, ACS AuM featured in the investment strategies category. In 2022, ACS showed a net outflow of \u20ac0.2 billion, while total ACS AuM amounted to \u20ac1.9 billion.\n\nTotal client assets in the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment stood at \u20ac67.4 billion at year-end 2022.\n\n## Loan portfolio\n\n| Loan portfolio (\u20ac million)                     | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   | 30/6/2022   | 30/6/2022   | 30/6/2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Mortgages                                      | 6,341        | 6,337        | 0%          | 6,365       | 0%          |\n| Other loans                                    | 2,371        | 2,199        | 8%          | 2,376       | 0%          |\n| Loan portfolio                                 | 8,712        | 8,536        | 2%          | 8,741       | 0%          |\n| Mortgages distributed by third parties         | 373          | 389          | -4%         | 394         | -6%         |\n| Other loans covered by residential real estate | 320          | -            |             | -           |             |\n| Total                                          | 9,404        | 8,925        | 5%          | 9,136       | 3%          |\n| Impairments                                    | -40          | -49          | -19%        | -41         | -3%         |\n| Total loan portfolio                           | 9,364        | 8,876        | 6%          | 9,094       | 3%          |\n\nOur total loan portfolio increased by \u20ac0.5 billion to \u20ac9.4 billion, driven by an increase in other loans as well as other loans covered by residential real estate.\n\n## Mortgages\n\nMortgages remained stable at \u20ac6.3 billion (2021: \u20ac6.3 billion) and make up 67% of our loan portfolio (2021: 71%). These mortgages are primarily granted to high networth individuals. The weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 63% (2021: 62%). Our underlying mortgage portfolio grew by approximately \u20ac350 million in net inflow, mainly at the beginning of 2022, but this growth levelled off in the last quarter, in line with the rest of the market. The net inflow was offset by value adjustments in hedges due to rising interest rates; this effect amounted to -\u20ac348 million compared with 2021.\n\n## Other loans\n\nOther loans comprise loans to high net-worth individuals as well as commercial loans that fit into our Private Clients relationship model. In 2022, other loans grew to \u20ac2.4 billion (year-end 2021: \u20ac2.2 billion). The increase came predominantly from Lombard loans in Belgium.\n\n## Mortgages distributed by third parties\n\nThe portfolio of mortgages distributed by third parties consists of regular Dutch mortgages. It accounts for 4% of our total loan portfolio, with a volume of \u20ac0.4 billion (2021: \u20ac0.4 billion).\n\n## Other loans covered by residential real estate\n\nIn 2022, we invested in a fund managed by a.s.r. Vermogensbeheer NV. The purpose of the fund is to make it possible for institutional parties to invest in Dutch mortgages. The investment amounted to \u20ac320 million at year-end 2022 and is a dedicated tranche for Van Lanschot Kempen, which consists primarily of Dutch mortgages with a Dutch national mortgage guarantee (NHG).\n\n## Impaired loans and provisions\n\nWe take provisions for the impaired loans in our loan book. Impaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) totalled \u20ac106 million at yearend 2022, and decreased by 30% compared with 2021 (\u20ac153 million), caused by solving some specific impaired exposures and limited new defaults. The total impaired ratio improved from 1.7% to 1.1% at the end of 2022.\n\n## AuM Wholesale & Institutional Clients (\u20ac billion)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Total risk exposure amount (TREA) increased to \u20ac4.3 billion in 2022 (year-end 2021: \u20ac3.9 billion), driven by the introduction of the higher capital requirements for residential mortgages by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), which had an impact of 2.8 percentage points. This was partly offset by reduced exposures and minor data and methodology improvements for example, in the macro fair value hedge accounting risk weighting. Available CET 1 capital decreased by \u20ac52 million. This decrease is due to the capital return of \u20ac61 million in December 2022.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (%)\n\n| Regulatory capital (\u20ac1,000)   |           | 31/12/2022 31/12/2021   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|\n| Risk-weighted assets          | 4,272,385 | 3,921,110               |\n| Common Equity Tier 1          | 878,507   | 930,789                 |\n| Required Common Equity Tier 1 | 383,972   | 330,337                 |\n| Tier 1                        | 978,507   | 1,030,789               |\n| Required Tier 1               | 476,096   | 407,643                 |\n| Total capital                 | 1,128,507 | 1,180,789               |\n| Required total capital        | 598,927   | 510,717                 |\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden, we will issue more than 1.5 million new shares in 2023.

At year-end 2022, both platforms combined had \u20ac6.0 billion in AuM held for around 150,000 clients.\n\nThe transaction will have a negative impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's CET 1 ratio of approximately 0.4 percentage points. A two-year integration path is anticipated, and is expected to involve one-off costs of between \u20ac8 million and \u20ac11 million. The combined platform is expected to break even by 2025 and to start making a positive contribution to Van Lanschot Kempen's net profit thereafter. The transaction is expected to be completed in June 2023, subject to any regulatory approvals that may be required.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Key risk themes for Van Lanschot Kempen\n\n## Interest rate risk: higher and more volatile interest rates\n\nOver the course of 2022, interest rates increased rapidly due to rising inflation and inflation expectations, and corresponding central bank rate hikes. Market interest rates became much more volatile as well. Net interest income has benefited - and is expected to continue to benefit - from higher interest rates, especially the higher deposit facility rate from the European Central Bank (ECB). But the major change in interest rates also confronts us with challenges on steering, pricing and hedging. We observed changing client behaviour: preference for long interest rate tenors has declined, and we also see a slightly increased demand for fixed-rate term deposits.\n\n## Operational risk: implementing change\n\nIn this rapidly changing world, organisations only survive if they continuously adapt to new circumstances. However, working on various major change projects simultaneously leads to an increase in operational risks.\n\nCompliance risk: increasing regulatory requirements for sustainability Implementing and adapting to sustainability-related regulatory developments remained one of our priorities. In 2022, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), EU Taxonomy and changes in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) regulations with regard to new sustainability requirements on disclosures, suitability and product governance all came into force.\n\n## Sustainability risk: climate change\n\nWe are exposed to climate risk via our activities, including both physical and transition risks. Given the nature of our activities, most of our climate risks are generally not significant and are not material to our operations. However, they are important to monitor and manage. Our main focus in quantifying and managing climate risk is the residential mortgage portfolio, as this holds the most significant position on our balance sheet that is prone to climate risks. Given the geographical characteristics of the Netherlands, we are exposed to flooding risk (physical) as well as transition risks impacting the value of the collateral in the future, due to rising energy prices and/or rising renovation costs to meet future legislation. The main risk for our assets under management (AuM) are the holdings that will suffer as a result of the energy transition.\n\n## Risk management\n\n## Risk profile and risk appetite\n\nWe seek to achieve a solid risk profile - expressed in transparent risk levels coupled with a robust liquidity and capital position. The risks we face are outlined in the following sections. More detailed descriptions can be found in the financial statements, where these risks are also quantified in terms of their impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's balance sheet.\n\nWe evaluate our risk appetite annually, and this is communicated in a risk appetite statement containing both qualitative and quantitative elements. Our risk appetite represents our willingness to accept the risk of particular losses, decreasing buffers and reputational risks, and as such sets our operating boundaries. The statement is prepared by the Management Board and is subject to the Supervisory Board's approval. Our 2022 risk appetite statement states:\n\n- -As an organisation, we manage risks within our risk appetite. The aim is not to minimise risks, because taking risks is a consequence of doing business;\n\n## Actions\n\nAs part of our regular interest rate risk management, we continuously monitor our exposure and any changes in client behaviour. Given the increased interest rate volatility, we pay more attention to embedded client options, such as offering mortgage rates that are capped during the offer period, and clients' right to take their current mortgage rates with them when moving house (under certain conditions), as well as the level of interest paid on savings accounts. We also increased the frequency of adjustments to client mortgage rates.\n\n## Actions\n\nIn 2022, we focused on finishing some significant change projects before starting new ones, to manage the total number of change activities. Furthermore, our risk management focus was on implementing the frameworks for managing change projects that were developed in 2021.\n\n## Actions\n\nSpecial efforts have been made on the implementation of various sustainability-related regulatory developments. As a result, we have been working extensively to adapt policies, procedures and controls to the new regulatory requirements as well as to the demands and expectations of clients and investors. The scale and complexity of the sustainability regulations and their impact on fund documentation, client and investment processes, reporting and data to be recorded and maintained are significant.\n\n## Actions\n\nWe made further enhancements to our stress-testing capabilities for both physical and transition risks. For our mortgage portfolio, we quantified the transition risks under the assumption that more stringent requirements on energy labels will be enforced via legislation and/or local regulation in the future. For physical risks, we used flooding data provided by national authorities and combined these with the collateral locations to derive stressed market values and possible effects on risk weighted assets/capital. In addition, we expanded our risk analysis to provide insights into the sustainability profile of our liquid funds.\n\n- -The risks we take - directly or indirectly - serve our business model and strategic objectives, and are the result of a careful process to balance risks and rewards;\n- -After determining how much risk we can potentially absorb, we determine how much risk we are willing to take. The sum of all risks taken should not exceed our risk-bearing capacity;\n- -We avoid certain risks, because they pose an existential threat to Van Lanschot Kempen; however, risks in the tail will remain, which we have to accept;\n- -We avoid risks that could lead to legal or regulatory breaches;\n- -We only take risks that we can understand and explain;\n- -When taking risks, we take the requirements and expectations of all stakeholders into account;\n- -Our risk appetite should be considered in all business decisions at every level of the organisation.\n\nTargets and risk limits are more dynamic and are occasionally reviewed, at least annually. We did not change the key principles that underlie our risk appetite and that create the framework within which we operate.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management governance\n\nWe operate our risk management framework in accordance with the three lines of defence model. The management teams at individual departments (the first line) are responsible for managing their specific risks. When serving our clients, they must also assess client- and portfoliorelated risks, ensure they adhere to all Van Lanschot Kempen policies, limits and procedures, and put processes and controls in place to remain in control of their own operations.\n\nThe Risk Management and Compliance departments (the second line) report to and advise the Management Board on all risk-related matters. The second line also provides guidelines on risk-taking activities, monitors adherence to these guidelines, and challenges the first line on the management of their risks. Finally, the second line supports management by facilitating and challenging risk assessments, and by providing relevant advice and assistance on applicable regulatory requirements and the design of controls and mitigating actions.\n\nThe Internal Audit department (the third line) monitors and gives assurance on whether the activities of the first and second lines are effectively mitigating the risks identified. We use insurance to cover certain remaining risks. Lastly, Dutch supervisors De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) as well as foreign supervisors (where applicable) check whether Van Lanschot Kempen adheres to laws and regulations and is in control of its own organisation.\n\nIn order to manage our risks, we have risk and compliance policies and frameworks in place as well as a governance structure. The Management Board remains responsible overall, but has delegated the management of specific risks to several committees: the Compliance & Operational Risk Committee, Sustainability Board, Credit Risk Committee, Market Risk Committee and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO).\n\n## Risk appetite and risk profile in 2022\n\nA risk dashboard and progress report are discussed by the Group Risk Committee every quarter, as well as periodically by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Supervisory Board. Risk-taking is inherent to our business model; low risks are not a means to an end. For a number of reasons, it may be appropriate to accept a higher risk - either temporarily or for a prolonged period. We always consider both gross and net - i.e. after mitigating measures - risk positions, paying extra attention to high net risks.\n\nThe risk appetite and risk profile in 2022 for each individual risk type are shown in this simplified version of the risk dashboard:\n\n| Risk dashboard      | Low   | Limited   | Medium   | High   |\n|---------------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Strategic risk      |       | \u00b7         | \u00b7        |        |\n| Operational risk    |       |           | \u00b7\u00b7       |        |\n| Compliance risk     |       | \u00b7         | \u00b7        |        |\n| Sustainability risk |       | \u00b7\u00b7        |          |        |\n| Credit risk         | \u00b7     | \u00b7         |          |        |\n| Market risk         |       | \u00b7\u00b7        |          |        |\n| Interest rate risk  |       | \u00b7\u00b7        |          |        |\n| Liquidity risk      | \u00b7\u00b7    |           |          |        |\n\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite\n\n\u00b7\n\nRisk profile in 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClients entrust us with their funds on the basis that they have no doubt about the financial and operational stability of the organisation. We can therefore only operate at limited risk levels. However, certain risks are unavoidable and can only be mitigated to a certain extent. Those two risk appetites are classified in the dashboard as medium: strategic risk and operational risk. Strategic risk appetite is medium while competition in private banking, investment management and investment banking is fierce. These risks can only be managed by actively optimising our results and growing through organic growth or bolt-on acquisitions. Given our increasing volume of assets under management (AuM), the complex nature of the business and the continuing innovation of our investment management offering, this results in a medium level of operational risk appetite. Of course, we strive to continuously reduce operational risks by improving processes, procedures and the organisation in general.\n\nOur strategic risks can be managed by generating organic and inorganic growth to maintain the necessary scale for the future, and to retain solid performance. As a result of the acquisition of Mercier Vanderlinden, strong organic growth in AuM and strong financial results, no issues arose in relation to strategic risk. All financial risk indicators (credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk) also scored well.\n\nWe experienced some operational incidents and went through several change projects in the reporting year, hence the risk score for operational risk in 2022 was categorised as medium.\n\nCompliance risk appetite was limited, while the actual compliance risk profile in 2022 was medium. Timely implementation and embedding of regulatory requirements remains a challenge, given the increasing regulatory demands that impact Van Lanschot Kempen's various business activities.\n\nOur sustainability risks were limited in 2022. The stress tests we performed did not show significant impact on balance sheet levels.\n\nA net release of loan loss provisions and low impairment ratios reflect our low credit risks in 2022. Given the derisking of our structured products activities, we have significantly reduced our risk profile for market risk. We currently operate under a tight limit framework, resulting in a limited appetite for both credit risk and market risk in 2022.",

        "page_content": "Our interest rate risk profile (balance sheet composition) did not change significantly, but large interest rate increases and greater volatility called for heightened attention. Liquidity risk remained low, due to our strong liquidity buffer and \"sticky\" client deposit base.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent, specialist wealth manager with the ambition to generate sustainable and profitable growth, while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet and a good track record in transformation processes and de-risking. This contributes to our solid reputation as a leading wealth manager in the Benelux region. To maintain our reputation, it's therefore important to manage strategic risks. Strategic risk is defined as the risk to Van Lanschot Kempen's performance resulting from failure to respond adequately to changes in external factors or from poor strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities, as well as public opinion. Keeping up with technological developments and fintech is also a key topic on our strategic agenda.\n\nWe manage our strategic risk by diversifying our sources of income through our private banking, investment management and investment banking activities - thereby ensuring that the three activities are complementary and support each other. Moreover, our lending activities focus primarily on residential mortgages and our clients have sufficient buffers, thereby limiting our strategic risks in terms of credit and risks of forced liquidation of AuM. In the current market environment of rising interest and inflation rates, we are well prepared for a possible light recession in 2023. All our client segments performed without major credit losses in 2022, even during volatile financial markets. However, a deep recession would impact all three client segments. The expected increase in risk costs will be partly offset by higher net interest income, resulting in some impact on our profit & loss (P&L). Even in these tough macroeconomic circumstances, a net positive P&L is expected. To manage our strategic risk in 2023, we have to remain focused on our core activities and areas of expertise.\n\nOther important elements are the capacity to meet all specific regulatory and client demands, the consequences of operating in specific niche markets, and the risks associated with a relatively small-scale organisation. We use a range of performance indicators - such as growth in AuM, net result, efficiency ratio, Net Promoter Scores and employee engagement scores - together with a qualitative assessment to monitor and control strategic risk. Due to the challenging environment, in both economic and technological terms, our strategic risk appetite remains at a medium level going forward. The technological improvements we have made for our clients and to our internal processes over recent years show that we are continuously aware of, and acting to address, this challenge. Lastly, through our acquisitions in recent years, we are actively addressing the risk of consolidation in the sector, and are improving our economies of scale.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nNon-financial risks comprise operational, compliance and sustainability risks.\n\nWe have defined a non-financial risk appetite. On a quarterly basis, the current non-financial risk exposure related to our non-financial risk appetite is discussed with members of the\n\nManagement Board and senior management in the Compliance & Operational Risk Committee. In 2022, the Risk Management department invested in updating nonfinancial risk methodologies to the latest standards, thereby investing in the overall maturity of all instruments of its risk management framework. Risk awareness within the company was raised both via increased capabilities within the first line of defence, and through challenges and advice from the second line of defence. We put increased focus on people risk and soft controls, which will continue to be a priority in 2023. Compliance, Risk Management and Internal Audit work together on this.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. To identify and manage operational and IT risks, we have created a group-wide operational risk management framework. Part of this framework is a set of key controls on the part of our value chains where residual risks are deemed to be elevated. Controls are regularly tested, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of key controls in our processes and systems. In 2022, we improved our root cause analyses. This meant not only focusing on resolving the issues at hand, but also on using these analyses for structural solutions in our way of working, from both a process and a systems perspective. Furthermore, we improved the quality of our risk control self-assessments, enabling us to focus on more preventive measures.\n\n## Information risk\n\nPreventing cybercrime remains one of our key focus areas. We are aware of the risks concerning information security and cybercrime, and we have further invested in technological and process-related measures to mitigate them. In addition to awareness programmes and staff training, we continue to develop intelligent solutions and to work closely with industry partners. We use surveillance systems to analyse the transactions in our systems and search for fraudulent activities. As part of a multi-year programme, we have stepped up security measures to keep pace with increasing cyberthreats. Dedicated teams monitor security events, including threats posted on the dark web. We have teams that simulate cyberattacks and conduct physical penetration testing for training purposes. To monitor the risks involved in cybercrime, we have developed an integrated risk dashboard. The metrics in the dashboard are overseen by the interdepartmental Information Security Board. Major issues related to cybercrime are reported directly to the Management Board.\n\nA key project in 2022 was the implementation of tooling for \"micro-segmentation\" in the network. This tool validates network traffic and blocks potential malicious activities. It also enables us to significantly reduce the damage that a potential malware attack, specifically ransomware, can do.\n\nFor the continuation of operational processes during potential disruptions, threats and incidents, we have business continuity measures in place. These include a policy, governance structure with a Business Continuity Committee and Crisis Management team, and working instructions. Moreover, multiple tests are performed during the year to assess whether these measures work in practice. As a result, we were able to run all systems from our back-up site for a period of more than a week, without any major disruptions.",

        "page_content": "## Internal fraud\n\nInternal fraud occurs when fraud is committed as an intentional action by one or more employees in which deception or management override of controls is used, with the intent of gaining unlawful advantage for oneself or a personal acquaintance at the expense of others. Employees also include management, temporary workers, contractors, trainees and interns. Internal fraud conflicts with Van Lanschot Kempen's Code of Conduct, which provides guidelines to help ensure our reputation and integrity.\n\nMaintaining our reputation as a trustworthy financial institution is of great importance to Van Lanschot Kempen. Preventing and mitigating internal fraud risks is therefore a high priority, as these risks can lead to financial impact on our clients and our business. In addition, internal fraud can damage the public's trust in Van Lanschot Kempen's reputation and integrity as a financial institution. The guidelines and processes for reporting and handling incidents are set out in our policy for handling integrity incidents.\n\nIncidents such as internal fraud cases are dealt with in accordance with the incident management procedure, which requires a root cause analysis to be conducted, as well as adequate follow-up to prevent reoccurrence. In 2022, no internal fraud, nor any attempt to commit internal fraud, was identified. As a result, no investigation of any person regarding internal fraud needed to be conducted.\n\nAssessing and mitigating internal fraud risk is an integral part of our risk & control framework. Internal fraud risk is assessed through risk control self-assessments on processes and through the Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA). The SIRA 2022 included various scenarios, such as the risk of employees stealing financial assets, physical assets or client data. The risk of employees executing unauthorised payments or credit transactions (as a result of insufficient segregation of duties or collusion) is also part of the risk assessment. The inherent risk of internal fraud in our overall risk assessment was evaluated as high: internal fraud can lead to substantial financial and reputational damage. However, effective control measures are in place to significantly reduce the risk. These control measures include the four eyes principle, access authentications, systemenforced checks on manual payments, and automated segregation of duties for payment systems. Our operating effectiveness is reviewed periodically by the first line of defence and independently reviewed by the second line.\n\nTo maintain the awareness of internal fraud risk, several initiatives are in place. Actions and priorities for continuous staff awareness and improvement are identified in the business-as-usual cycle. Staff training, starting with the onboarding training for new employees that covers the Code of Conduct (including incident management), as well as periodic updates, are part of fraud mitigation measures.\n\nBased on the assessments conducted, the residual risk rating for internal fraud risk is categorised as limited, which is within our risk appetite. For more information about operational risk and internal fraud, see Section 5, 'Operational risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Investment compliance risk\n\nSince 1 January 2021, the risk management function of Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management has been integrated with the group Risk Management department. Through this integration, the Risk Management department has better oversight and can apply a uniform risk management approach and procedures across all activities. The risk management framework combines all relevant regulatory requirements for Van Lanschot Kempen, including specific requirements for Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management: the Investment Firms Regulation (IFR), Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS). The risk management framework identifies, measures, manages and monitors all relevant risks to which our AuM are exposed. Quantitative and qualitative risk limits are set where possible on market, counterparty, liquidity and sustainability risks, and are described in the various risk policies. As Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management manages our clients' AuM, the risks resulting from these activities are reported as operational risks, as major errors could lead to potential claims from clients.\n\nFinancial markets faced a tumultuous and volatile year. In the United Kingdom, investors in general, and pensions funds specifically, faced an even more challenging period when the new Prime Minister announced a \"mini-budget\" with large, unfunded spending increases at the end of September. This resulted in spikes in UK rates and, as a consequence, in severe liquidity problems for some UK pension funds posting collateral for their interest-hedging strategies. We guided our UK pension fund clients through the storm, with active involvement from Risk Management to monitor investment compliance and to calculate liquidity and risk-and-return scenarios on a daily basis. As a consequence of this financial market shock, most of our investment funds saw negative absolute returns. However, roughly half of our investment funds outperformed their respective benchmarks. Notably, over the entire year, our equity value strategies posted positive absolute returns, clearly outperforming the growth strategies in 2022.\n\nAll client portfolios are monitored against regulatory guidelines, investment guidelines (e.g. fund prospectuses and investment management agreements, which put limits on credit, counterparty credit and liquidity risks) and our internal policies on a daily basis. There were no material findings from the investment compliance programme. Overall, our investment funds remained within the set risk limits throughout the year.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nWhen operating in financial markets, it is important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, employees, shareholders and supervisory authorities, but also that we follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our shared values and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for our business. Van Lanschot Kempen has established a compliance framework to manage compliance risks appropriately, to ensure business operations adhere to laws, rules and regulations, and to make sure we act in the best interests of our clients. The compliance framework applies across the entire organisation, including foreign locations.",

        "page_content": "## Financial crime risks\n\nCombatting financial and economic crime, and mitigating risks relating to client due diligence (CDD), anti-money laundering, sanctions, client tax integrity and anti-bribery and corruption, are ongoing priorities for Van Lanschot Kempen. In 2022, efforts were made to further develop our anti-financial crime framework: the process to check the progress and quality of CDD reviews was improved and risk indicators relating to client tax integrity were refined.\n\nWe believe that raising awareness and providing training for our staff are important elements in preventing financial and economic crime. We provide anti-financial crime training to employees who have contact with clients or are involved in detecting financial crime. In 2022, various live and online sessions were launched to maintain awareness of client tax integrity and client due diligence among employees. In addition, the Compliance department provided anti-financial crime training for the Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nDue to the war in Ukraine, the number of sanctions issued by various countries increased rapidly in 2022. Our processes for managing sanctions proved to be effective. The actions and operational measures required were overseen and steered by a taskforce that was set up immediately after the first sanctions were imposed. In 2022, DNB launched an investigation among several banks and payment institutions to test the effectiveness of existing sanction-screening systems, in which Van Lanschot Kempen took part. The overall operation of our systems was deemed satisfactory.\n\n## Client protection risks\n\nClient protection risks relate to best execution and order handling, client suitability, marketing, inducements and product governance. In 2022, several initiatives were implemented following new regulatory requirements to ensure that we continue to protect our clients and inform them appropriately.\n\nOne of the key topics in 2022 was the change in the regulatory landscape, mainly due to new sustainability rules and regulations. The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), EU Taxonomy and changes in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), UCITS and AIFMD regulations with regard to new sustainability requirements on disclosures, suitability and product governance all came into force. As a result, we have been working extensively to adapt policies, procedures and controls to the new regulatory requirements as well as to the demands and expectations of clients and investors. The scale and complexity of the sustainability regulations and the impact on fund documentation, client and investment processes, reporting and data to be recorded and maintained are significant.\n\nIn 2022, we completed our interest-only mortgages project. The way of working is now fully embedded in ongoing management of interest-only mortgages. We proactively approach our clients to discuss their future financial situation, the risks and possible solutions for the redemption of their mortgage. This enables clients to take timely measures, if necessary.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen Investment Management markets its services as \"investment strategies\" throughout Europe. Under the newly implemented cross-border distribution of funds regulation, this may trigger a notification to the local supervisory authority, before marketing. As a result, our (pre-)marketing approach and notification processes for the cross-border distribution of funds were updated.\n\n## Business conduct risks\n\nBusiness conduct risks relate to conflicts of interest, market conduct, market abuse and employee integrity topics, such as secondary positions and personal account dealing (PAD). In 2022, several projects were initiated to further improve our existing processes to manage business conduct risks.\n\nThe Compliance and IT departments joined forces to upgrade our PAD tool for employees. The aim is to fully automate the current system for the requisite pre-clearance of employee orders as well as existing restrictions in the investment universe. Automation will lead to less manual labour, greater efficiency and more robust monitoring.\n\nWithin Investment Banking, a project was launched to further strengthen and formalise our processes around cross-border provision of services and activities. With regard to market conduct, employees received specific training tailored to the needs of their business activity. A project to refine our policy on the use of business devices was also initiated, in light of our increasingly digital society.\n\n## Personal data integrity risks\n\nPersonal data integrity risks relate to data privacy, data retention/deletion and adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). As part of the Compliance department, we have designated a Data Protection Officer (DPO), who holds an independent position within the company. The DPO operates a personal data integrity programme to support the organisation in its obligations and to foster awareness, as well as to establish internal policies, advise on data privacy matters, monitor compliance with data privacy laws, and report to the Privacy Committee, Management Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nThere were no major changes in our exposure to personal data integrity risks in 2022. Our adherence to GDPR and the general discretion of employees is an ongoing priority and is integral to the service we offer as a wealth manager.\n\nAs part of our training and awareness initiatives, we launched an e-learning programme on special categories of personal data, aimed at employees who work with personal data of clients, prospects or employees. Moreover, an initiative was set up to further improve our voice logging process and to mitigate the personal data integrity risks relating to voice logging. Our voice logging process operates in line with the GDPR as well as MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (MAR).\n\nFor more information about compliance risk, see Section 12, 'Compliance risk', in the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's risk management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks. Sustainability risks, with climate change as the most prominent risk driver, fall into the category of external risks. Sustainability risk is a rapidly developing and highly complex focus area in the wealth management industry, affecting the whole organisation. Targets, processes and risks can only be efficiently addressed by an effective governance structure. To optimise our knowledge of sustainability risks, we have consolidated our overall expertise into our Sustainability Centre, while more direct sustainability expertise resides within the business. To promote efficient decision-making, we have created one main committee, the Sustainability Board, which includes two Management Board members. We have also created two sub-committees: the Sustainability Investment Council, covering the sustainability risks of our AuM, and the Sustainability Council Loans and Own Organisation, covering our own balance sheet and organisation's sustainability risks. The Sustainability Board approves strategic sustainability priorities and monitors the implementation of the strategy and these priorities.\n\nAll information previously provided in the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has been integrated into this \"Sustainability risk\" section of the annual report instead of a separate document.\n\nIn 2021, our first sustainability risk policy was implemented, based on guidance on climate-related and environmental risks by the European Central Bank (ECB). Our policy describes responsibilities for managing sustainability risks as well as the types of risk, whereby attention is mostly paid to physical and transition risks as a result of climate change. Physical risks include negative effects from adverse weather events, or businesses or assets becoming obsolete (stranded assets). Transition risks include risks that arise from the adjustment process towards aligning with sustainability requirements in a broad sense (i.e. regulatory risks, government measures, taxes, international treaties and so on).\n\nBased on a methodology that looks at various risk types (e.g. credit risk, operational risk), the main sustainability risks (physical and transition) and the available data, there is currently no reason to apply a management overlay to the IFRS 9 models (Stages 1 and 2) as these risks are not considered to be material. In addition, the IFRS provision for Stage 3 is determined per individual credit file by the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department. If there are significant climate risks relating to our Stage 3 loans, those risks are taken into consideration when the IFRS 9 provision is determined. A management overlay is therefore not necessary for Stage 3.\n\n|                   | Physical risks                                                                                                                                                                           | Transition risks                                                                                                                                                       |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Market risk       | Extreme weather events may result in significant  additional costs, while open market positions in  companies affected by climate events can decrease in  value.                         | New internal ESG policies or regulatory requirements  may result in (partially) impaired assets.                                                                       |\n| Credit risk       | Diminishing collateral values may result in higher cost of  default (protection).                                                                                                        | New policies may require investment, potentially  reducing credit scores.                                                                                              |\n| Liquidity risk    | Access to markets may be disrupted due to severe  climate-related events.                                                                                                                | There is a shift towards new policies and attitudes  surrounding liquidity risks, such as imposing higher  haircuts or adverse climate-related liquidity stress tests. |\n| Reputational risk | Pressure from stakeholders and society to comply with  sustainability principles is increasing, which may lead to  higher reputational risks.                                            | New policies and market sentiment may increase  reputational and/or liability risks relating to  greenwashing.                                                         |\n| Operational risk  | Increased severity of climate-related events could  impact our office locations and disrupt our systems,  people and processes.                                                          | The burden caused by changes and disclosures which  have to be made to operate, now and in the future, may  have an adverse impact.                                    |\n| Legal risk        | Stranded assets may increase the risk of litigation.                                                                                                                                     | Major losses resulting from transition risks may  increase the risk of litigation.                                                                                     |\n| Regulatory risk   | Non-compliance with new regulations in relation to  physical risks (protection and risk assessments of  Van Lanschot Kempen's activities, disclosure, etc.)  presents a regulatory risk. | Non-compliance with new regulations in relation to  transition risks (risk assessments, limit settings,  disclosure, etc.) presents a regulatory risk.                 |\n\nSustainability risks are managed via the Sustainability Board (consistent with our three lines of defence model). Given the nature of our clients, many environmental risks are not material for us. As a wealth manager, the majority of our lending exposure is to private individuals in the form of mortgages. For our limited lending to businesses, we maintain a strict exclusion list for activities we do not wish to finance, and we carry out sustainability screening to identify other risks.\n\nIn 2022, we improved methods to calculate impact and materiality, concluding that there are no significant climate risks to our business at present. We also continued to enhance our dataset and monitor activities relating to the sustainability objectives of our own organisation, balance sheet and AuM, in order to establish a more accurate and dynamic overview of the (potential) impact of our actions on the environment. Lastly, we have been working to embed and integrate sustainability elements in all our core processes, controls, product development, policies, reporting and so on, instead of creating separate activities that are additional to our existing processes.",

        "page_content": "## Risks to our operations\n\nOne of the more probable sustainability risks to our operations is the threat of flooding in certain parts of the Netherlands. Of our 29 office locations, 11 are well above sea level and are not exposed to river flooding; nine are protected by inland dikes; and nine are below sea level and/ or exposed to river flooding. If some of our offices flood, the employees affected will be able to work from home or at one of our other offices. The pandemic proved that working with the majority of staff at home is possible without any major interruption to business activities. The necessary information and systems for employees can be provided in such a scenario, while both our data centres in Eindhoven and 's-Hertogenbosch are well above sea level (if the dikes are no longer able to withstand the sea).\n\nOur back-up data centre in 's-Hertogenbosch has limited exposure to river flooding (once in 1,000 years), while our primary site in Eindhoven has very low risk of river flooding. The combined extremely low risk is acceptable for our organisation.\n\n## Risk to our balance sheet\n\nOur responsible lending policy takes environmental and social impact into consideration. This policy covers periodic sustainability screening (due diligence), via a risk filter, of all existing and new business loans, and includes factors such as human rights, social and labour issues, environment, anticorruption and bribery. During 2022, the screening did not identify any new material sustainability issues in the portfolio. The number of potentially high-risk borrowers (clients active in sectors associated with a higher risk of human/labour rights violations or environmental pollution) totalled only one at year-end 2022 (2021: 16). This decrease is the outcome of winding down our corporate banking loan book and more strictly reviewing and following up with borrowers. We continue to engage with the remaining highrisk borrower about specific sustainability risks and how they could be mitigated. For more information on this policy and its results, see our sustainability supplement and our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en/sustainability/policy/ banking-activities.\n\nWe assess financial institutions with which Van Lanschot Kempen has a banking relationship on an annual basis. This assessment aims to prevent the risk that client assets are exposed - through interbank loans or investments, for example - to institutions with weak or non-existent sustainability policies. We check whether financial institutions have committed to more than 50% of nine wellknown international sustainability initiatives, at a minimum. If not, we start an engagement process with the institution. Our 44 financial institutional counterparts all currently comply with this policy. In 2022, there was no need to engage with any financial institutions in our portfolio.\n\nSince 2016, we have been calculating and reporting on our balance sheet-related carbon emissions, mainly for mortgage loans, other loans and our investment portfolio. For our Private Clients segment, the most significant lending portfolio is our residential mortgage portfolio. In 2022, we developed a stress test to quantify the physical risk of this mortgage portfolio in terms of flooding risk. Using granular data (at neighbourhood level) on flooding probabilities and water levels, we stressed market values of our collateral.\n\nPreliminary results show that this risk is not significant due to the locations of our collateral, the clients' assets and relatively low average loan-to-value ratios (LTVs). However, more research is needed to draw final conclusions on materiality.\n\nFurthermore, we encourage our clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and other types of property we finance to reduce transition risks. For example, we offer our Groenhypotheek (green mortgage), which provides financing at reduced interest rates to clients who are looking to make their homes more sustainable and energy-efficient. We believe that, in the future, less energy-efficient homes will go down in value. In 2022, a stress test was developed to quantify this transition risk. We concluded that the transition risk is non-material at present, due to the relatively low average LTVs of our residential mortgage portfolio.\n\nIn our other loans portfolio, we see limited climate change risk, mainly because of the regional and sectoral characteristics of our portfolio. Coupled with this, our corporate banking loan exposure is minimal, reflecting our earlier strategic choice to wind down this activity.\n\nWe also see limited transition risks in our equity exposure, stemming from our equity brokerage and structured products activities. For equity brokerage, the holding period (only a few days) and net exposures are quite limited (\u20ac3.0 million at year-end 2022), while transition risks in general tend to be longer term. Furthermore, as a specialist broker, we focus on selected sectors - European real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech and infrastructure & renewables - which limits the transition risks. And we have no exposure to polluting industries, for example. Similarly, for our structured products activities, our net exposures are quite limited; for the most part, exposures are in large diversified equity indices such as S&P and Eurostoxx50. Stress test outcomes show that climate risks for our equity exposures are limited and fall within our regular trading limits.\n\nTo support our own managed funds, we provide seed capital and manage these funds in our management book. At yearend 2022, we had investments to the tune of \u20ac120.9 million in our funds, of which 57.7% were in Article 8 (52.5%) or Article 9 (5.2%) funds, categorised as such under SFDR. An internally developed stress test showed that climate risks in these positions are limited and well within our regular limits.\n\n## Regulatory sustainability risk\n\nAs an independent, specialist wealth manager with the ambition to generate sustainable and profitable growth over the longer term, we put great emphasis on sustainability in our investment solutions. Articles 6, 8 and 9 are classifications imposed by SFDR, launched by the European Union in 2021 to ensure that there is clear information about the extent to which investment products are sustainable. Sustainable investment funds either promote environmental and/or social characteristics (Article 8) or have sustainable investment objectives (Article 9). Funds that do not take sustainability into account in any way, shape or form are classified as Article 6. In anticipation of SFDR Level 2 requirements that came into force on 1 January 2023, we updated our prospectuses to include compulsory annexes disclosing sustainability characteristics for each individual fund.",

        "page_content": "A key distinction between funds will be the percentage of sustainable investments in economic activities contributing to social or climate goals. As the year progressed and the interpretation of SFDR rules for Article 9 funds proved ever stricter, we decided to reclassify five funds from Article 9 to Article 8. We were looking to provide clarity to our clients as soon as we possibly could, and hence took this step based on own analysis, advising our clients in August. The Van Lanschot Kempen funds that remain classified as Article 9 have a sustainable focus theme or purpose to achieve sustainable impact, such as our SDG Farmland Fund and our Global Impact Pool.\n\n## Risks to our assets under management\n\nIn our AuM activities, climate change risks are taken into account when investments are made or investment managers are selected. As part of our responsible and sustainable investing, we also have a climate change policy that we have improved over the years. We have now set strong targets, in line with the Paris Agreement, on carbon emissions reduction for our investment funds, to be met by 2025, 2030 and 2050 - enabling us to cope with the transition risks related to climate change. This also enhances resilience to physical climate change risks, as the companies in these investment funds will take climate change into account.\n\nAs physical risks will likely materialise more in certain regions and sectors (with physical assets) than others, we have started to gather physical climate data down to asset level for our real estate portfolios from a specialist climate data provider. We have further improved the implementation of our net-zero commitments by setting annual KPIs to reduce our carbon footprint according to the Paris Agreement targets. We use climate scenarios for most of our managed global and European liquid portfolios to assess their climate resilience compared with the benchmark. We also use climate change risk indicators (proxies) from our climate data provider for several internal funds and some large clients. Since 2020, we have been integrating climate change mitigation into our current asset allocation scenarios via GDP assumptions (i.e. scenarios ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C of global heating). And we have incorporated DNB's climate stress test for the equity market into our risk system.\n\nIn 2022, we expanded our risk analytics to provide insights into the sustainability profile of our managed liquid portfolios. We developed environmental, social and governance (ESG) and carbon emissions monitoring tools, which allow us to challenge portfolio managers on whether their investment decisions are in line with the investment strategy and whether the portfolio is on track to meet the annual targets to reduce carbon emissions. We have also started gathering data for the Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indicators that fall under SFDR. These are negative, material, or likely to be material effects on sustainability factors that are caused, compounded by, or directly linked to a company's investment decisions. We prepared for the implementation of these indicators for our portfolios in our risk analytics. We will start monitoring these indicators in 2023.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks comprise credit, market, interest rate and liquidity risks. These risk are managed by various committees: the Credit Risk Committee, Market Risk Committee and Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO). All these committees approve policies, which outline the main boundaries for the financial risks we accept.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nOur credit risk is considered to be limited. Our loan portfolio amounts to \u20ac9.4 billion and has manageable risks; 67% of the loan portfolio consists of the Private Clients segment's Dutch residential mortgage loans. We aim to keep the size of this portfolio at least constant (or with modest growth) by generating enough new business to offset repayments and prepayments. New mortgages are primarily provided to private clients who also hold AuM with us.\n\nCredit quality in general further improved in 2022. The pandemic did not have an impact on the credit quality of our portfolio, because the majority of the loan book consists of mortgages, and most of our clients have significant financial buffers. Covid-related financial support to SME clients in March and April 2020 was repaid in the normal way. There has been no direct impact on our portfolio from the war in Ukraine. In 2022, loan losses continued to reach historically low levels. In order to monitor and measure credit risks for most of our loan portfolios, we use sophisticated risk models: an internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. For regulatory reporting, we use only our residential mortgages IRB model. As observed in 2021, we are seeing positive rating migration in nearly all portfolios as an additional indicator of improved credit quality. Our loan portfolio and credit risks are concentrated in the Netherlands (92%); lending in Belgium and Switzerland is limited, and mainly consists of Lombard loans with low risk profiles.\n\n## Loan portfolio, excluding provision (100% = \u20ac9.4 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough our exposure to the Dutch housing market is fairly significant, the concentration risk on single line items in the overall loan portfolio is relatively limited. The ten largest loans to individual counterparties, other than financial institutions, totalled \u20ac227 million at year-end 2022, compared with \u20ac183 million at year-end 2021 1 . In 2022, the credit risk limits on the ten largest loans to individual counterparties increased slightly, as well as the use of credit by these individual counterparties. At year-end 2022, 96.9% of the Dutch loan portfolio consisted of loans of less than \u20ac10 million (year-end 2021: 96.9%).",

        "page_content": "Our policy is to keep credit risk limits on any single debtor at an acceptable level in order to contain concentration risk and to mitigate its potential impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's results. For more information, see Section 3.5, \"Concentration within the loan portfolio\", in the financial statements.\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nAt year-end 2022, 67% of our loan portfolio consisted of the Private Clients segment's residential mortgages. Our portfolio differs from that of other Dutch mortgage lenders in that the average loan (approximately \u20ac575,000) is higher. This makes the portfolio a little more sensitive to a fall in underlying house prices, although the majority of our exposure is in urban areas - generally a more liquid segment of the housing market. Our methodology for determining the LTV of residential mortgages is based on the indexed foreclosure value. This methodology is in line with the generally accepted norms for LTV determination. In the first half of the reporting year, house prices in the Netherlands continued to increase. In the second half of 2022, however, prices flattened and even decreased towards the end of the year. The portfolio's weighted average LTV, based on foreclosure value, increased slightly to 63% at year-end (year-end 2021: 62%). New issuances are, in general, issued for LTVs between 50% and 90%.\n\nIn 2020, we started our interest-only mortgages project, the aim of which is to enable clients to make conscious choices about their interest-only mortgages. For example, we actively assist clients with potentially declining incomes (e.g. due to retirement) to limit the risk of not being able to pay off their loans at maturity date. To this end, we provide insights into the status of their mortgage and its future affordability and flexibility. All clients with interest-only mortgages (including investment-based mortgages) are plotted on a matrix based on guidelines from the AFM. The matrix is based on the LTV combined with the remaining financial term, term to retirement, or end of tax deductibility. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, all clients in the high and medium risk categories (LTV over 50%) were approached and the results recorded. This project was completed in 2022 for clients in the low risk category (LTV below 50%). All clients can now make adjustments to their interest-only mortgages in the electronic portal. In this way, we increase awareness among clients and try to avoid potentially difficult situations.\n\n## Energy labels of homes with residential mortgages\n\nAt year-end 2022, 47.8% of homes with mortgages had an A, B or C energy label. Due to the nature of our client base, a substantial percentage of homes still have D, E, F or G energy labels. If no label is available, an estimate is derived from the year of construction of the property. Over the course of 2022, we were able to improve our data quality and reduce the number of missing energy labels.\n\n## Energy labels: number of homes per label\n\nMortgage loans: new production by type (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMortgage loan-to-value (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In the same category are commercial activities that fit into our Private Clients' relationship model, such as funding investments for family businesses, business professionals, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs. These kinds of loans are supplementary to our wealth management strategy and typically involve the client bringing in AuM. Our aim is to keep the size of this portfolio stable.\n\nStarting in 2021, we began reporting our corporate banking loan portfolio in this category as well. The winding down of this portfolio continued in 2022, and it now amounts to \u20ac79 million (2021: \u20ac132 million).\n\nOther loans: type of loan (100% = \u20ac2.4 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Real estate loans\n\nOur real estate loans, both those provided to private clients and corporate banking's legacy portfolio, amount to \u20ac180 million (2021: \u20ac381 million). These loans are provided primarily on the basis of a total quality assessment of the borrowers. We also take into account the quality and sustainability of the property, and the diversification and stability of the rental flows. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) is calculated so that we can determine the extent to which a client will be able to make interest and principal payments from the rental income generated by their commercial real estate. At year-end 2022, 91% of our real estate loans generated sufficient rental income to cover interest and principal payments - i.e. had a DSCR of over 1 (year-end 2021: 88%). Clients with a DSCR of less than 1 often have other income-generating assets they can use to service their loan obligations. Lastly, the LTV of real estate loans improved in the first half of the year as a result of increasing real estate prices, although this trend halted in the second half. Property markets are cooling down and average prices are expected to decrease further in 2023. However, there has been no deterioration in our credit quality so far, which is an indication of the low LTVs of our portfolio and the substantial liquidity buffers of our clients.\n\n## Other mortgage exposure\n\nWe provide mortgages through a network of intermediaries, branded as Hypotrust and with Quion as our service provider for our white-label mortgages. We have built up a white-label portfolio with good risk characteristics and with very few loan losses. Our white-label mortgages are subject to strict acceptance criteria, and the size of the portfolio amounted to \u20ac373 million by year-end 2022 (year-end 2021: \u20ac389 million). This portfolio has decreased and makes up 4% of the total loan portfolio.\n\nIn 2022, we invested in a Separate Account Mortgage Fund (SAMF) managed by a.s.r. Vermogensbeheer NV. The purpose of the fund is to make it possible for institutional parties to invest in Dutch mortgages. The investment amounted to \u20ac320 million at year-end 2022 and is a dedicated tranche for Van Lanschot Kempen, which consists primarily of Dutch mortgages with a Dutch national mortgage guarantee (NHG). The credit risks are limited due to the NHG guarantee. We only run a small amount of credit and operational risk if the NHG claim procedures are not completed fully by a.s.r. Vermogensbeheer NV.\n\n## Impaired loans\n\nImpaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) are defaulted loans in IFRS 9 credit quality Stage 3. The impact of the pandemic on our portfolio, combined with the effects of the war in Ukraine (i.e. considerable impact on energy and commodity prices) was closely monitored throughout the year. At year-end 2022, the impact on our portfolios was once again limited. This is mostly due to the composition of the portfolio, with mainly mortgages and very limited business loan exposure, coupled with most of our private clients having significant financial buffers.\n\nImpaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) totalled \u20ac106 million at yearend 2022, and decreased by 30% compared with 2021 (\u20ac153 million). Impaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) accounted for 1.1% of the loan portfolio at year-end 2022 (year-end 2021: 1.7%). In 2022, a provision equal to 25% of impaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) was taken (2021: 28%), resulting in specific provisions totalling \u20ac26.9 million.\n\n## Loan loss provision\n\nIn 2022, we released \u20ac7.7 million in provisions (in 2021, we released \u20ac11.7 million) driven by a few individual client files. At year-end, provisions amounted to \u20ac40.0 million. Over the course of 2022, we saw an increase in exposures in Stage 1 and 2 and a decrease in exposures in Stage 3. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine had a major impact on energy and commodity prices and drove up inflation. We therefore deemed it appropriate to move from sector-specific overlays (amounting to \u20ac1.6 million in 2021) to a more general overlay, which affects all clients. The overlay consists of three adjustments in the IFRS 9 models: an adjustment that affects the probability-of-default, an adjustment to better reflect recent arrears behaviour, and an adjustment to the weighing of the macroeconomic scenarios. This management overlay is more in line with the general trend of increased risk in the portfolio and amounts to \u20ac5.2 million, which means an addition of \u20ac3.7 million on the management overlay from 2021.\n\nFor more information about credit risk, see Section 3, 'Credit risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Market risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is exposed to market risk through client-facilitating transactions. Our Treasury department performs structured products transactions for clients. Our Investment Banking Clients team performs equity transactions for clients and provides market liquidity, which may result in trading positions. Both our Private Clients team and our Treasury department perform transactions in interest-related and foreign currency products. These activities may also result in trading positions. Temporary positions may arise from our efforts to facilitate our clients' requests. We invest in our own funds in order to align our interests with those of our clients and to support our investment management activities. We supported a newly launched fund (the Van Lanschot Kempen Private Real Estate Pool) and divested some funds. The Risk Management department monitors market risks on a daily basis.\n\nFinancial markets in 2022 were challenging and volatile due to the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and a regime change at central banks to battle rising inflation. As a result, equity valuations went down and rates went up significantly, resulting in negative performance in both equity and bond markets. All three activities exposed to market risk showed relatively stable returns despite volatile markets (structured products, equity brokerage, and interest and foreign exchange products for Private Clients).",

        "page_content": "As a result of extreme financial market volatility in 2020, we made significant losses on the structured products activities. This resulted in the strategic decision to reduce the risks on this activity significantly by moving from a macro-hedging strategy to an almost exclusively back-to-back hedging strategy, thereby decreasing most of the market risks in the portfolio. The structured products activities are being managed according to plan, with complex products now being almost exclusively hedged back-to-back. Structured products activities' trading limits have been decreasing in conjunction with the run-off of the macro-hedged portfolio, thereby reducing the market risks in the portfolio even further. The volatile financial markets in 2022 were a live test of the stability of the portfolio, which weathered the storm well with no major losses. The de-risking of the structured products portfolio was completed by year-end 2022.\n\nFor further information on market risk, see Section 4, 'Market risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nOver the course of 2022, interest rates increased rapidly due to rising inflation and inflation expectations, and corresponding central bank rate hikes. This major change in the interest rate environment confronted us with implications on client behaviour, pricing, hedging and positioning.\n\nWe noticed a declining appetite for interest rate maturities longer than ten years. Moreover, in line with market developments, we saw a general decline in the volume of mortgage applications in the second half of 2022. We pay close attention to embedded client options in mortgages, which expose us to option risk. This mainly involves the offer option (clients being entitled to a fixed rate, as offered, even if market rates rise substantially) and the right to take their current mortgage interest rates with them when moving house (under certain conditions). We also expect early redemptions (prepayments) on mortgages with \"old\" low interest rates to decline substantially.\n\nOn the liability side, we noticed an increasing appetite for fixed rate deposits, especially in the final quarter. Margins on term deposits (the bulk of client appetite is for tenors up to one year) are substantially smaller than on variable rates. For variable rate deposits, we stopped charging negative interest on large deposit balances in October 2022. Despite this, margins on variable rate deposits have increased substantially, as increases in client rates generally lag behind increases in the ECB deposit facility and market interest rates.\n\nIn 2022, our ALCO maintained a positive interest rate \"mismatch\" position. This can be represented by duration of equity, which was kept within a 2-5 year range. Although a positive duration of equity generally contributes positively to net interest income, it does come with opportunity costs (foregone opportunity to invest at more favourable rates) when interest rates increase. Although net interest income projections have increased substantially on the back of improved margins on variable rate deposits, in 2022 we incurred some loss in economic value due to opportunity losses. Despite high interest rate volatility, we remained well within all interest rate risk limits.\n\nFor more information on interest rate risk, see Section 8, 'Interest rate risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nOur wealth management business model naturally comes with a large client deposits base. These entrusted funds grew again from \u20ac11.7 billion to \u20ac12.7 billion in 2022. Our December 2022 loan-to-deposit ratio amounted to 73.6% (2021: 75.7%), which reflects the fact that our client deposit base well exceeds our client loan book volume.\n\n## Funding mix (100% = \u20ac17.0 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecause of this, our reliance on other funding sources is limited, and our liquidity risk profile is mostly driven by the potential occurrence of unanticipated deposit outflows. Although our deposit base has proven to be sticky over time, there is always a risk of unexpected outflows, particularly for balances not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS).\n\nAs our appetite for liquidity risk is low, we aim to hold solid liquidity buffers that would allow us to absorb severe unexpected liquidity stress situations. Outcomes of liquidity stress tests, which cover acute and persistent liquidity stress, are discussed by our ALCO on a monthly basis. Due to our strong liquidity buffer, stress test outcomes and other liquidity indicators such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) remained well within limits throughout the year. At year-end 2022, the LCR and NSFR stood at 178.3% and 158.1% respectively (2021: 172.0% and 163.0%).\n\nThe main funding and liquidity planning objective in recent years has been to reduce the impact of excess liquidity on net interest income, while maintaining a solid liquidity cushion and sufficient funding diversification. Due to improved margins on client deposits, we can currently maintain more leeway when it comes to clients preferring to maintain their balances in cash.\n\nAlthough our loan-to-deposit ratio is well below 100%, we aim to keep a degree of diversification in our funding mix in terms of funding type and maturity by supplementing the client deposit base with secured debt instruments that are issued under our covered bond programmes. Due to our structurally high liquidity buffer, we only issued a \u20ac500 million covered bond under the Soft Bullet Covered Bond programme, which was established in 2022 and will replace the Conditional Pass-through Covered Bond programme over time.",

We do not have any benchmark-size unsecured debt issuances placed with investors. The redemption profile of our capital markets debt and capital instruments is outlined below. In 2020, we participated in the targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO) programme for an amount of \u20ac400 million. We redeemed this amount in December 2022.\n\n## Funding and capital instruments redemption profile (\u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and investment portfolio composition\n\nOur liquidity buffer (excluding retained own debt instruments) totalled \u20ac6.2 billion at year-end 2022, down from \u20ac6.3 billion at year-end 2021. We maintained \u20ac3.0 billion at the ECB deposit facility, as this still offers a more favourable rate than other very low-risk investments such as Dutch or German sovereign bonds.\n\nOur investment portfolio (liquidity buffer minus central bank deposits) is maintained primarily for liquidity purposes, and consists mainly of liquid, low-risk instruments. The composition of the portfolio was relatively stable in 2022. There are strict limits on instrument types, counterparties, countries, ratings and credit spread risk. Despite lower yields and spreads, we maintained a liquid, low-risk investment portfolio in line with our investment policy.\n\nIn addition to day-to-day portfolio management, we review our investment portfolio annually to ensure it meets our ESG criteria.

Excess equity capital has been used for acquisitions and distributed to shareholders via equity capital returns. At our Capital Markets Day in May 2022, we announced a new common equity tier 1 (CET 1) ratio target of 15% plus a 2.5% M&A add-on. We also announced that we plan to return additional capital in excess of a 17.5% CET 1 ratio to shareholders. When the announcement was made, the additional capital amounted to \u20ac145 million, of which \u20ac61 million has already been distributed to shareholders. We plan to return \u20ac2.00 per share (approx. \u20ac85 million) in the second half of 2023, subject to regulatory approval. Furthermore, if the CET 1 ratio exceeds the 15% plus an M&A add-on of 2.5% by the end of 2023, our intention remains to return capital above our target to our shareholders going forward, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nOur enhanced CET 1 target ratio is well above the CET 1 requirement that stems from the supervisory review evaluation process (SREP). The latest SREP, which was concluded in August 2022, and overall capital requirements are outlined in the table below. Required CET 1 capital is 6.5% for Pillar 1 and 2 risks. In addition, we are expected to comply with 0.24% Pillar 2 guidance. Combined buffer requirements (countercyclical and capital conservation buffer) currently require 2.5% CET 1 capital. DNB has indicated that the countercyclical buffer will be at 2% by the end of 2024. Our year-end capital ratios well exceed overall capital requirements (including a 2% countercyclical buffer) and our own targets.\n\n| SREP and overall capital  requirements from August 2022  (%)   |   CET 1 |   Tier 1 |   Total  capital |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|\n| Pillar 1                                                       |     4.5 |      6   |              8   |\n| Pillar 2                                                       |     2   |      2.6 |              3.5 |\n| Total SREP capital requirement                                 |     6.5 |      8.6 |             11.5 |\n| Capital conservation buffer                                    |     2.5 |      2.5 |              2.5 |\n| Countercyclical capital buffer                                 |     0   |      0   |              0   |\n| Pillar 2 guidance                                              |     0.2 |      0.2 |              0.2 |\n| Overall capital requirement                                    |     9.2 |     11.3 |             14.2 |\n| Capital ratios at year-end 2022                                |    20.6 |     22.9 |             26.4 |",

        "page_content": "As DNB is concerned about systemic risk in the Dutch housing market, it implemented a risk weight floor for residential mortgages. This floor applies to mortgages that are capitalised based on the IRB approach, and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Due to our solid mortgage portfolio, which results in low IRB risk weights, the impact of this floor is relatively large (2.8 % points CET 1 as of 31 December 2022). DNB recently announced that the risk weight floor will apply until at least the end of 2024.\n\nStarting in January 2025, the EU legislation that covers Basel IV is expected to come into force. Basel IV affects three key aspects of measuring capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the revision of the standardised approach, which will increase standardised risk weights for certain loan categories. The second relates to the maximum capital benefit banks can obtain from IRB credit risk models. By imposing an overall risk weight floor equal to 72.5% of risk weights based on the standardised approach, the maximum benefits from using internal credit risk models are effectively limited. The risk weight floor comes into effect on 1 January 2025 at 50%, and will be phased in over a five-year period to 72.5%. The third aspect of Basel IV, which is particularly relevant for us, is a phased-in increase in risk weighting of equity exposures, of which we have a relatively large amount (including investments in private equity fund Bolster and Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management funds).\n\nThe main non-credit risk-related element of Basel IV is the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), which we implemented starting in June 2021. Compared with the current Basel III legislation, FRTB is a more risk-sensitive approach. It takes our hedging strategy better into account when calculating the net-market risk position, and we therefore observe a structurally lower capital requirement.\n\nWe expect our solvency to benefit from a simultaneous release of the DNB risk weight floor and phased-in implementation of Basel IV. As these solvency benefits will only be temporary, we apply a certain degree of conservatism regarding Basel IV in our capital planning. In our capital planning (including equity capital returns), we therefore assume Basel IV will come into effect on a fully loaded basis straight away, starting in January 2025.\n\n## Resolution regime not applicable; MREL requirements equivalent to SREP demands\n\nIn November 2022, DNB informed us that we will not be classified as a \"resolution institution\". DNB also announced that the loss absorption requirements (minimum required eligible liabilities (MREL) that have to be met from January 2024) will be set equal to prevailing SREP requirements (i.e. the January 2024 MREL requirements will be equal to the SREP requirements that will be set by DNB in 2023).",

Depositary receipts for Van Lanschot Kempen's Class A ordinary shares have been traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 29 June 1999 (ISIN Code: NL0000302636; ticker: VLK.AS).\n\nThe issued share capital of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2022 consisted of 41,361,668 Class A ordinary shares ('shares') each having a nominal value of \u20ac1. We held 644,350 treasury shares at year-end 2022. Van Lanschot Kempen is included in the Amsterdam Small Cap Index and in the MSCI World Small Cap index.\n\n## Shareholders and depositary receipt holders\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's shareholder base was stable during 2022. Pursuant to Chapter 5.3 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the disclosures below have been entered in the Register of Substantial Holdings as maintained by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The percentages reflect the number of shares or depositary receipts on the register on the disclosure dates and our current number of outstanding shares.\n\nDisclosure is required once a shareholder's interest reaches, exceeds or falls below a threshold value. The current interest of a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts may consequently differ from the interest reported on the disclosure date. On 31 December 2022, Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen held over 99.99% of Van Lanschot Kempen shares. For more information on Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen, see 'Corporate governance' on page 100.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's depositary receipt holders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement and employees jointly owned around 4.9% of our issued share capital at year-end 2022 (year-end 2021: 4.2%). A new employee share plan was introduced in the reporting year known as the Matching Share Plan: each Van Lanschot Kempen share that an employee buys - up to a maximum value of \u20ac2,500 - is matched by Van Lanschot Kempen one year later. A large number of employees made use of this share plan in 2022. In 2023, we will continue the\n\nshare plan, but employees will be able to buy shares up to a maximum value of \u20ac3,500, which will also be matched one year later. Employees will also be given the opportunity to buy shares at a discount of 18.5%, up to a value of \u20ac15,000. All shares purchased under the employee share plan are subject to a five-year lock-up period.\n\n## Share issuance\n\nIn December 2022, we announced the next step in our collaboration with Mercier Vanderlinden by accelerating the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake, subject to regulatory approval. This stake will be paid for in cash (53%) and newly issued shares (47%) under a lock-up provision until 2030. To this end, we will issue more than 1.5 million new shares in 2023, and Mercier Vanderlinden's partners will obtain a significant holding in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nOur creditworthiness is periodically assessed by Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Van Lanschot Kempen maintains its high creditworthiness by deploying its assets for the benefit of its clients and by taking on only such risks as can be understood and controlled. This ensures solid risk management processes as well as a strong capital and liquidity position. Our current credit ratings reflect our healthy capital and funding position along with our low risk profile. Van Lanschot Kempen currently has a BBB+ longterm credit rating from both S&P and Fitch.\n\n| Credit ratings                   | Standard & Poor's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|\n| Long-term credit rating          | BBB+                | BBB+            |\n| Long-term credit rating  outlook | Stable outlook      | Stable outlook  |\n| Short-term credit rating         | A-2                 | F2              |\n| Date of latest report            | 7 November 2022     | 4 July 2022     |\n| Date of latest press  release    | 24 June 2021        | 15 June 2022    |\n\n## Research coverage\n\nTwo sell-side analysts (from ABN AMRO - ODDO BHF and Kepler Cheuvreux respectively) actively track Van Lanschot Kempen and regularly publish equity research reports. For details, see vanlanschotkempen.com/share-information.\n\n## Dividend policy and dividend for 2022\n\nOur aim is to distribute between 50% and 70% of our underlying net result attributable to shareholders. The result actually available for distribution is the net result adjusted for minority interests, the share of holders of AT1 capital securities, and the net effect of selected special items. In 2022, the underlying net result available for distribution to shareholders amounted to \u20ac110.9 million, working out at underlying earnings per share of \u20ac2.72 1 .\n\nOur strong results and solid capital position enable us to propose a dividend distribution of \u20ac1.75 per share to our shareholders (2021: \u20ac2.00 per share). The shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM) to be held on 25 May 2023 will be invited to adopt the dividend proposal.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nThis report gives an overview of the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2022. For a description of the composition and operation of the Supervisory Board, see \"Corporate governance\" starting on page 98 .\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Management Board on performing its management tasks and setting the direction for Van Lanschot Kempen. In its activities, the Supervisory Board focuses on long-term, sustainable value creation for our clients, for our shareholders and for society. The members of the Supervisory Board are fully independent.\n\nThis report includes information about the achievement of corporate targets, the relationship with stakeholders and the relevant aspects of sustainability. It also covers the internal organisation, the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, and the annual evaluation of the performance of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members.\n\n## Supervision\n\n## Achievement of corporate targets\n\nThe reporting year 2022 was characterised by geopolitical tensions, market turmoil and high inflation. This also impacted Van Lanschot Kempen's clients, its employees and the company itself.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's wealth management strategy, focusing on organic and inorganic growth with a capital-light balance sheet, has proven to be effective amid market turmoil. This was evidenced by high net inflows in both the Private Clients segment and the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment. The volume of assets under management (AuM) decreased, driven by negative market performance.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden was announced. This transaction fits the ambition of the company to become a top-three player in the independent private banking sector in Belgium.\n\nAt the Capital Markets Day on 11 May 2022, enhanced medium-term financial targets were presented, as well as plans for additional capital returns to shareholders and growth ambitions for the various client segments.\n\nIn terms of financial targets, the efficiency ratio stood at 73.1% at year-end 2022, against a target of 70% - showing that this still requires attention. The company's capital position continued to be strong in 2022, which allowed for a capital return to shareholders of \u20ac1.50 per share (around \u20ac60 million in total) in December 2022.\n\nSustainability remains an important topic for stakeholders. The implementation of new sustainability regulations requires a substantial effort from the organisation. In addition, more ambitious targets were set to decrease carbon emissions.\n\nAnother focus point in the company's independent wealth management strategy is the participation of employees as shareholders in Van Lanschot Kempen. Since introducing a partnership plan for Van Lanschot Kempen's senior staff and a new share plan for all employees, more than 70% of employees are now shareholders in the company. The participation rate is expected to increase further as a result of the stake of more than 3% that will be owned by Mercier Vanderlinden's partners.\n\n## Structure and functioning of risk management\n\nOn 1 September 2022, the responsibility for compliance reporting moved from the former Audit and Compliance Committee to the new Risk and Compliance Committee. The names of these committees were changed to reflect the change in their scope. For more information about Supervisory Board committees, see pages 80-84.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's principal risks, as well as the structure and functioning of its risk management and control systems, are discussed by the Risk and Compliance Committee. In 2022, the committee's chair reported the main conclusions and recommendations to the Supervisory Board. Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite statement is subject to the Supervisory Board's annual approval. The risk appetite statement for 2023 was approved at the Supervisory Board's December meeting.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nFinancial reporting is discussed regularly at the Audit Committee's meetings, which are also attended by the external auditors. After each meeting, the chair of the committee reports on committee discussions to the full Supervisory Board. All members of the Supervisory Board attended the Audit Committee's meeting in 2022 at which the 2021 annual figures were discussed. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements for 2021 on 23 February 2022.\n\nFollowing a proposal by the Supervisory Board, PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) were reappointed as external auditors for the 2023 financial year at the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 25 May 2022. In January 2023, the Supervisory Board decided to propose the reappointment of PwC for the 2024 financial year to the AGM to be held on 25 May 2023. To comply with mandatory audit firm rotation obligations no later than 2026, Van Lanschot Kempen started a process to select and appoint a new external auditor. For more information about the selection and appointment process, see page 82.\n\n## Legal and regulatory compliance\n\nThe Supervisory Board is regularly provided with information on developments regarding the compliance framework; further development of the compliance programme; group-wide projects to strengthen policies and control arrangements, especially concerning anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing, sanctions and client due diligence processes; and the supervision of the regulatory authorities regarding compliance with regulations. The Supervisory Board was informed periodically about the ongoing implementation of new legislation and regulations, such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), preparation for the new",

        "page_content": "environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting requirements under the EU Taxonomy, the Gender Balance Act, the amended European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on internal governance, and the EBA and European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management board and key function holders. In addition, the Supervisory Board was informed about progress on the implementation of compliance policies as well as the implementation of the recommendations resulting from the off-site inspection by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) of the internal governance and risk management of the compliance function in 2021.\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly discussed Van Lanschot Kempen's relationship with its shareholders. At the Capital Markets Day, the following topics were discussed with shareholders: progress against the company's wealth management strategy, the revision of its medium-term financial targets, organic and inorganic growth opportunities, the company's strong capital base, and its sustainability profile and approach.\n\nThe Supervisory Board values its constructive relationship with the Works Council. Bernadette Langius and Karin Bergstein had meetings with the Works Council in February and May 2022. They also attended a meeting of the Works Council with a delegation of the Management Board, at which the general course of business at Van Lanschot Kempen was discussed.\n\nFrans Blom had several meetings with the Works Council Board to discuss the process for the selection of a new member of the Supervisory Board, to fill the vacancy that will arise as a result of the end of the second appointment term of Bernadette Langius in 2023. As the Works Council has an enhanced right of recommendation for this vacancy, Frans Blom met the Works Council Board to discuss the shortlist of candidates and the final selection of the preferred candidate.\n\n## Relevant aspects of sustainability\n\nIn June 2022, the Supervisory and Management Boards took part in an educational session on sustainability. The Supervisory Board discussed the company's 2022 sustainability ambitions, roadmap, progress on implementing various regulations and standards, and the management of climate and environmental risks. The regulations resulting from the EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan in particular have a significant impact. In addition, the Risk and Compliance Committee was informed about progress made on applying the company's responsible lending policy.\n\nThe Supervisory Board is pleased to see that Van Lanschot Kempen is putting significant work into integrating all relevant aspects of sustainability further into its client solutions and risk management processes. Given the continuous developments in this field, as well as evolution towards more purpose-driven and value-based leadership within companies, sustainability remains a topic where the bar will continue to rise. As such, it requires ongoing attention from Van Lanschot Kempen going forward.\n\n## Internal organisation\n\n## Composition of the Management Board\n\nOn 1 September 2022, Constant Korthout stepped down as member of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board is profoundly grateful to him for his great contribution to the success of Van Lanschot Kempen over the past 12 years, during which the company greatly benefited from his knowledge and experience. Together with the former Chair of the Management Board, Karl Guha, he led the efforts to build a company with a robust capital position, a low risk profile and excellent financial results. Constant Korthout had held the position of Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer (CFO/CRO) since 2010.\n\nThe Supervisory Board decided to split the combined role into two separate positions from 1 September 2022 onwards. This resulted in two vacancies on the Management Board, thus increasing the number of members from five to six. Jeroen Kroes was appointed as Chief Financial Officer and member of the Management Board, while Wendy Winkelhuijzen was appointed as Chief Risk Officer and member of the Management Board, both from 1 September 2022 until the AGM in 2027. Jeroen Kroes and Wendy Winkelhuijzen held various positions within Van Lanschot Kempen before being appointed as members of the Management Board. Jeroen Kroes most recently served as Managing Director of Finance, Reporting & Control, while Wendy Winkelhuijzen most recently served as Managing Director of Strategy & Corporate Development. The Supervisory Board is very pleased with their appointments.\n\nRichard Bruens and Arjan Huisman were reappointed as members of the Management Board for a period until the AGM in 2026.\n\nThe Management Board currently consists of Maarten Edixhoven (Chair), Jeroen Kroes, Wendy Winkelhuijzen, Arjan Huisman, Richard Bruens and Erik van Houwelingen.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nTo ensure an appropriate and balanced composition of the Supervisory Board, the Board regularly discusses its profile and composition. The composition of the Supervisory Board did not change in 2022. According to schedule, Maarten Muller's appointment term expired in May 2022. He was reappointed as a member of the Supervisory Board by the AGM on 25 May 2022 until the AGM in 2026.\n\nBernadette Langius's term of appointment as a member of the Supervisory Board will expire after the AGM in 2023, according to schedule. As this is her second term, she will not be available for reappointment. The recruitment process for a new member of the Supervisory Board has started, and the Supervisory Board expects to propose this new member to shareholders at the AGM in 2023.\n\nFor further information and background on the members of the Supervisory Board, see page 108.",

        "page_content": "## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held 12 meetings in 2022. The Management Board attends the formal meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed supporting information. Regular items on the agenda of these meetings include the company's strategy, developments within the various business activities, corporate governance, risk management, compliance, audit, IT, operations, financial results, the annual budget, capital strategy and HR topics.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board discussed:\n\n- -Revision of the financial targets;\n- -Preparation for the Capital Markets Day;\n- -Proposal for a capital return to shareholders;\n- -Client group action plans;\n- -M&A opportunities;\n- -Progress on the cooperation between Van Lanschot Belgium and Mercier Vanderlinden;\n- -IT roadmap of investment management activities;\n- -Progress on several compliance projects;\n- -Progress on the implementation of the recommendations resulting from the DNB off-site inspection of the internal governance and risk management of the compliance function;\n- -Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA) 2022;\n- -Succession planning;\n- -New inclusion and diversity policy and action plan to achieve the targets for diversity among the Management Board and senior staff;\n- -Introduction of a partnership plan for key senior employees;\n- -Climate strategy and action plan;\n- -Tax policy;\n- -Branding strategy of Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe Supervisory Board held ten additional meetings with Supervisory Board members only. These meetings give the Supervisory Board the opportunity to reflect on agenda items and discuss possible items that require attention in advance of the regular meetings, as well as to discuss matters such as the composition of the Management and Supervisory Boards and the evaluation of how both boards are working. The Chair of the Management Board was invited to attend some of these meetings, depending on the topics being discussed. At the meeting in February 2022, the Supervisory Board discussed the performance of the members of the Management Board in 2021.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received the information needed to perform its tasks from the Management Board. Information was also provided by the external auditors. Employees from within the organisation regularly attended meetings to provide additional information on specific topics within their respective fields. The agendas for Supervisory Board meetings were drawn up by the Company Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the Supervisory Board. Between meetings, Frans Blom regularly maintained contact with the Chair of the Management Board. Supervisory Board members also held meetings with members of the Management Board and employees, relating to their membership of specific Supervisory Board committees and particular topics.\n\nSupervisory Board members were rarely absent from the Supervisory Board meetings or meetings of its committees. The table below shows the composition of Supervisory Board committees, and the attendance rate of each member of the Supervisory Board at the Board and committee meetings.\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n## Composition of Supervisory Board committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members. Each committee advises the Supervisory Board and prepares decision-making by the Board in its designated area of interest. These committees meet separately throughout the year. The main considerations and conclusions of the committees are shared with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board remains fully responsible for all decisions.\n\nAs a result of the decision to split the CFO/CRO role into two separate positions from 1 September 2022 onwards, the discussion of compliance topics was also shifted from the Audit and Compliance Committee to the Risk Committee from that date. Consequently, the names of these committees were changed to the Audit Committee and Risk and Compliance Committee respectively.\n\n| Composition and  attendance rate   | Supervisory  Board   | Audit  Committee   | Risk and  Compliance  Committee   | Selection and  Appointment  Committee   | Remuneration  Committee   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Frans Blom                         | 100% (Chair)         | 100%               |                                   | 100%  (Chair)                           | 100%                      |\n| Manfred Schepers                   | 91%                  | 100%               | 100%                              |                                         |                           |\n| Karin Bergstein                    | 100%                 | 100%               |                                   |                                         | 83%                       |\n| Brigitte Boone                     | 82%                  |                    | 100%                              | 88%                                     |                           |\n| Bernadette Langius                 | 95%                  |                    | 100%                              |                                         | 100%                      |\n| Maarten Muller                     | 100%                 |                    | 100%                              | 100%                                    |                           |\n| Lex van Overmeire                  | 82%                  | 100%               | 100%                              |                                         |                           |",

The external auditors, Managing Director of Internal Audit and Managing Director of Finance, Reporting & Control were also present at the meetings to discuss financial performance and audit matters. The Managing Director of Compliance attended the meetings that took place before 1 September 2022. The Audit Committee also met with the internal and external auditors without the members of the Management Board being present, to discuss the course of affairs during the financial year.\n\nThe Audit Committee carried out a detailed assessment of the annual figures, half-year figures and information used for the trading updates. Particular attention was paid to significant financial items in relation to the company's (interim) financial statements and disclosures, which are shown in the table below.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee discussed the most relevant and sizeable financial claims against Van Lanschot Kempen for which no provision was taken because their chance of materialising was considered to be less than 50%, the internal duties and comprehensive responsibilities regarding ESG reporting in the annual accounts, and the external auditors' report of Van Lanschot Kempen's 2021 regulatory returns, which were submitted to DNB.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Audit Committee review and conclusion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors Impairments for individually identifiable loans are based on IFRS 9.

For credit-impaired loans, the Credit Risk and Credit  Restructuring & Recovery team provides input in determining the level  of credit loss allowances.

The annual plan and quarterly reports from the Internal Audit department were discussed as part of the committee's evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of Van Lanschot Kempen's governance, policy framework, risk management and internal control systems. The committee discussed the annual evaluation of the Audit Charter, progress against the annual plan and the quality of Internal Audit's operation.\n\nIn addition, Internal Audit reports presented the results of assessments of the risk & control framework and operation, the implementation and operation of IT systems, policy alignment and implementation for remote entities, fraud prevention, client due diligence and repatriation of funds in Belgium, fund management, large projects such as the integration of Mercier Vanderlinden, improvements for the Investment Strategies & Solutions department and the sustainability programme.\n\nBased on the reports by both internal and external auditors, the Audit Committee concludes that the internal control environment is adequate for external financial reporting purposes.\n\n## Risk and Compliance Committee\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee met three times in 2022. Its meetings were also attended by the Chair of the Management Board, CFO/CRO (from 1 September onwards the CRO and CFO), the Managing Director of Risk Management and the Managing Director of Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery. Since 1 September, the meetings have also been attended by the Managing Director of Compliance.

The quarterly compliance reports, execution of the compliance programme, compliance risks and progress on compliance projects were discussed in the meetings of the Audit and Compliance Committee until 1 September and in the meetings of the Risk and Compliance Committee from 1 September 2022 onwards. Quarterly reports from the Compliance department included the reports by the Data Protection Officer on personal data integrity and adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Risk and Compliance Committee also discussed developments in cybersecurity and the outcome of SIRA 2022. In addition, reports from Compliance provided information about contact and communication with regulators. Compliance's 2023 annual plan was discussed at the committee's December meeting.\n\nThe quarterly risk appetite reports were discussed by the Risk and Compliance Committee. In all meetings, specific attention was paid to reviewing whether Van Lanschot Kempen's risk profile was within the limits set by the company's risk appetite. At its meetings, the committee discussed credit risk, execution risk of specific change projects, data management risk, cybercrime and IT risk, business continuity risk and various non-financial risks, including ESG-related risks. Interest rate and market risk developments were discussed based on factors including duration analyses, the development of value at risk, and stress tests.",

The main risks for Van Lanschot Kempen  are a major decline in the economy coupled with falling house prices.                                                                                                                               | The Risk and Compliance Committee was informed about credit risk  developments in the loan portfolio based on several indicators (loans 30  days past due, amount of defaults, loan-to-value ratio, etc.). Based on  these indicators and the IFRS 9 and IRB models, the credit quality of the  loan portfolio improved in 2022, despite macroeconomic uncertainty.  The various scenarios under which we would expect a deterioration in  the quality of the loan portfolio were highlighted. |\n\n## Selection and Appointment Committee\n\nThe Selection and Appointment Committee met eight times in 2022. The committee discussed the recruitment of a new member of the Supervisory Board to succeed Bernadette Langius. An external executive search consultant supported the committee and the Supervisory Board in the selection process. The committee also discussed succession planning, the reappointment of Maarten Muller as member of the Supervisory Board, the reappointment of Constant Korthout\n\n(until 1 September 2022), Arjan Huisman and Richard Bruens as members of the Management Board, and the appointment of Jeroen Kroes and Wendy Winkelhuijzen as new members of the Management Board.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee held six meetings in 2022. Representatives from the HR department also attended the meetings. The Chair of the Management Board and CFO were invited to attend the Remuneration Committee meetings. At its February meeting, the committee discussed the Management Board's key performance indicators (KPIs) for 2022 and the 2021 remuneration report. At the committee's January meeting, the 2021 variable remuneration paid to Van Lanschot Kempen staff was discussed. The committee also discussed the new method for determining the size of the variable remuneration pool available. The total amount available for variable remuneration of Van Lanschot Kempen staff for 2022 was among the topics discussed at the December meeting.\n\n## Assuring governance quality\n\n## Evaluation of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board values the structural evaluation process to ensure continuous improvement in its way of working. Each year, the Supervisory Board evaluates the composition and functioning of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members. The evaluation is carried out under the guidance of an external adviser once every three years. In 2022, the evaluation process was carried out using a questionnaire completed by each Supervisory Board member. The evaluation includes the participation and contribution of each member of the Supervisory Board, the knowledge and experience of the Supervisory Board collectively, the interaction and dynamics within the Supervisory Board, the communication and provision of information, the decision-making process and quality of the information provided for Supervisory Board meetings, the independence of mind of the individual members, whether members are able to commit sufficient time to fulfil their role within the Supervisory Board, and the relationship with the Management Board. The outcomes of the evaluation were discussed by the Supervisory Board at a meeting in January 2023, and recommendations will be implemented as a result.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concluded that the Board and its committees are functioning well, and that its composition is in line with the required profile in terms of suitability, expertise and diversity, and also complies with Principle 2.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Supervisory Board also concluded that it is important to meet informally more often to exchange views on potentially important themes for the future, and to discuss the company's longterm strategy with the Management Board. The relationship with the Management Board is open and constructive, while remaining sufficiently critical. Suggestions to further improve the operation of the Supervisory Board include ensuring an appropriate balance between presentation and discussion during the Supervisory Board meetings. Conclusions and recommendations relevant to the Management Board will be shared with the Management Board.\n\n## Evaluation of the Management Board\n\nIn February 2023, the Supervisory Board evaluated the functioning of the Management Board as a whole and that of its individual members based on the KPIs for 2022. The Supervisory Board sets the KPIs for the Management Board every year. These KPIs consist of Van Lanschot Kempen's external financial and non-financial KPIs, with additional\n\nKPIs on financial and non-financial topics. The achievement of the KPIs by the Management Board is monitored during the year. Financial KPIs for 2022 include the return on CET 1, the CET 1 ratio and the efficiency ratio. Non-financial KPIs include the sustainability ambitions, reductions in carbon emissions, employee engagement, inclusion and diversity, and the Net Promoter Score for Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Evi van Lanschot. For further information on performance against these KPIs, see \"How we steer and monitor our business\" on pages 20-21.\n\nThe assessment of the KPIs is included as the basis for the collective assessment of the Management Board and the individual assessment of its members for 2022. In addition, a delegation of the Supervisory Board reviewed the 2022 performance and lessons learned with the individual members of the Management Board in January and February 2023. In the discussions with the two new members of the Management Board, specific attention was paid to their initial impressions from their first four months in the role, and to the main themes they will focus on in 2023. The outcomes from the meetings with the members of the Management Board were discussed by the members of the Supervisory Board in February, who concluded that the members of the Management Board performed well in 2022, both collectively and individually. These conclusions were shared with the members of the Management Board. The 2023 KPIs for the Management Board are in line with Van Lanschot Kempen's financial and non-financial KPIs for 2023 (see pages 20-21).\n\nThe Management Board evaluated its own operation and effectiveness on a regular basis during its off-sites. Board members gave each other feedback on their strengths and points to consider, and reflected on these. In 2022, the Management Board also discussed the way it functions under the guidance of an external adviser.\n\n## Tax integrity policy\n\nIn 2022, a policy on tax-related matters for members of the Supervisory and Management Boards was designed and implemented. On the basis of this policy, the personal investments of the members of the Supervisory and Management Boards were assessed. Based on the outcomes of this assessment, it was concluded that no actions were required.\n\n## On-boarding programme\n\nAll new members of the Management and Supervisory Boards complete a comprehensive on-boarding programme when appointed. The programme is tailor-made for each newly appointed Board member, as their knowledge and experience varies. The aim of the on-boarding programme is to ensure that new Board members have thorough knowledge of Van Lanschot Kempen, its strategy, business activities and key risks in order to fulfil their role within the Management and Supervisory Boards. Depending on the individual role and needs of the Board members, in-depth meetings with senior managers of relevant departments are incorporated into the on-boarding programme.\n\n## Education\n\nAs ongoing education is an important part of good governance, the members of the Supervisory and Management Boards take part in a continuous education programme. In 2022, three educational sessions were organised.",

All members of the Supervisory Board perform their duties independently and critically. The independence requirements described in best practice provisions 2.1.7 to 2.1.9 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code have been fulfilled. Currently, there are no dependent members on the Supervisory Board. In the event of a potential conflict of interest relating to a particular topic, the Supervisory Board member concerned is not allowed to participate in discussions or decision-making on that topic. Best practice provisions 2.7.3 to 2.7.4 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code were observed as far as applicable. In 2022, there were no conflicts of interest of material significance for members of the Supervisory or Management Boards.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Supervisory Board has reviewed and approved the annual report for 2022 and the 2022 financial statements. The 2022 financial statements have been audited by the external auditors, PwC. The independent auditors' report can be found on page 228. The external auditors have also issued an assurance report on the sustainability information in this annual report, which can be found on page 248 . We invite the AGM to adopt the 2022 financial statements as submitted, and to discharge the Management Board in respect of its conduct of Van Lanschot Kempen's affairs and the members of the Supervisory Board in respect of their supervision.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank all stakeholders for their continued trust and confidence in Van Lanschot Kempen and the Management Board.\n\nLastly, we would like to thank the Management Board and all employees for their ongoing, unwavering dedication and commitment to Van Lanschot Kempen and its clients over the past year.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 22 February 2023\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nFrans Blom, Chair\n\nManfred Schepers, Karin Bergstein Brigitte Boone Bernadette Langius Maarten Muller\n\nVice-Chair\n\nLex van Overmeire",

This report is guided by requirements originating from the EU Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD II).\n\nThis report includes both a summary of our Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies and our annual report on remuneration, which sets out how our policy was applied during 2022 and how it will be applied in 2023. On 28 May 2020, the annual general meeting (AGM) approved the remuneration policies for the Management Board with a majority of 93.7% of the votes cast, and for the Supervisory Board with 100% of the votes cast.\n\nThe 2021 remuneration report was approved by the AGM (advisory vote) with a majority of 99.95% of the votes cast. There was no specific follow-up given the outcome of this vote. We did not receive any substantive comments on the 2021 remuneration report. The 2022 remuneration report will be subject to an advisory vote at our AGM on 25 May 2023.\n\n## Alignment with our strategic framework\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a specialist, independent wealth manager with a banking licence. This leads to specific challenges from a remuneration perspective, especially within the Dutch regulatory context.\n\nComposition Chair\n\nBernadette Langius\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKarin Bergstein\n\nMembers Frans Blom\n\nWe are the second largest wealth manager in the Netherlands and we compete with large financial institutions in our sectors. We strongly believe that our future success requires a robust Management Board with a proven track record in wealth management and related investment banking activities, while experience in digitalisation and advanced analytics is also key. As a consequence, the remuneration of the Management Board members should be such that Van Lanschot Kempen is able to attract and retain the necessary talent, which includes future board members from highly specialist wealth management and technology firms. Moreover, the Management Board's remuneration package must be structured to fit properly within the Dutch context.\n\n## Remuneration principles remained unchanged in 2022\n\nWe believe in rewarding long-term sustainable performance to help achieve our long-term strategy. This is reflected in our Management Board remuneration policy. Since 2015, this consists of fixed remuneration only (no variable remuneration) and includes a large proportion in depositary receipts for shares (hereinafter: shares), with a five-year lock-up period, in combination with share ownership guidelines 2. This creates a strong focus on long-term value creation.\n\nThe remuneration structure for the Management and Supervisory Boards remained unchanged in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Total remuneration in 2022\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Management Board periodically, taking into account internal and external perspectives. When adopting the Management Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company and remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce. Moreover, the Remuneration Committee takes note of individual Management Board members' views regarding the amount and structure of their own remuneration.\n\nIn line with the Management Board remuneration policy approved by shareholders, the Supervisory Board indexed the fixed remuneration of the members of the Management Board. The indexation was applied on 1 January 2022 and amounted to 2%, in line with the wider workforce.\n\nFor more information about the Management Board's remuneration package and pay ratios, see 'Remuneration of the Management Board in 2022' on page 91.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses and challenges the performance of the Management Board based on a set of financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are strongly aligned with the KPIs for the rest of the organisation, and reflect both the interests of its stakeholders and its ambitions as a wealth manager. In assessing the performance of the Management Board, great value is attached to their performance as a team. This is the starting point of the performance assessment, given the company's integrated wealth management model. If the performance of a Management Board member is under par, the Supervisory Board may decide not to apply any indexation. If it is consistently under par, the Supervisory Board may dismiss the responsible Board member (after consulting the general meeting).\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe take stakeholders' views very seriously and welcome an open dialogue on all aspects of remuneration. In preparation for the 2020 AGM, a delegation from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board consulted with a large cross-section of the company's shareholder base, proxy advisers, the Works Council, various client groups and Dutch political parties. At these meetings, an explanation was given about SRD II; the Management and Supervisory Board remuneration policy; the Supervisory Board's view on rewarding long-term sustainable performance; and the Dutch context, such as the Dutch law on remuneration of financial undertakings, and the Dutch Corporate Governance and Banking Codes.\n\n## Looking ahead to 2023\n\nThe remuneration policy for the Management and Supervisory Boards will remain unchanged in 2023.\n\nThe 2023 indexation of the fixed remuneration of the Management Board was discussed by the Supervisory Board, in line with the remuneration policy. For the wider workforce - governed by collective employment conditions - an indexation will be applied, amounting to 4.4% on 1 January 2023 and 1% on 1 July 2023. These relatively high percentages are a result of the high inflation environment. The Supervisory Board believes it is appropriate to apply a lower indexation percentage to the Management Board, in line with senior staff who have individual employment conditions.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concluded that the performance of all Management Board members was (at least) on target, and that indexation can be justified by the company's financial performance. The decision was therefore made to index the fixed remuneration of the Management Board: 3.5% on 1 January 2023 and 0.5% on 1 July 2023.\n\nThe remuneration policies of the Management Board and Supervisory Board will be reviewed in 2023, in preparation for their inclusion on the agenda of the AGM in 2024. As part of this review, the peer groups that are used to benchmark remuneration will be reconsidered.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 22 February 2023\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nBernadette Langius , Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to remuneration: rewarding long-term sustainable performance\n\nOur purpose is to preserve and create wealth for our clients and for society in a sustainable way.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is the oldest independent financial institution in the Netherlands. Founded in 1737 in 's Hertogenbosch, Van Lanschot Kempen has brought several entities together over time. Our ability to continuously adapt to the changing needs of our clients is what allows us to succeed, now and in the future.\n\nWealth is not just about financial resources; it encompasses everything that is valuable in life. It's about safeguarding our clients' heritage for generations to come - or starting to build that heritage. It's about pursuing growth or handing over a business that has been built over the years. It's about seizing opportunities and creating peace of mind. In short: it's about security, dreams, ambitions, wishes and decisions - and all of these are specific to each individual.\n\nAt Van Lanschot Kempen, we're driven to understand the complete picture for our clients. We use our collective expertise and talents to present them with fitting solutions and products in support of their long-term goals.\n\nThis view is reflected in our approach to remuneration. The remuneration of the Management Board consists of fixed remuneration only, and includes a large proportion in Van Lanschot Kempen shares (with a five-year lock-up period), creating a strong focus on the long-term continuity of the company and subsequent strong client relations.\n\n## We believe in:\n\n## Focusing on the long term\n\nVariable remuneration is scrutinised in Dutch society, especially in the financial sector. The use of variable remuneration can lead to a focus on short-term performance. As we believe in rewarding longterm sustainable performance, we pay only fixed remuneration to the Management Board.\n\n## Rewarding sustainable performance\n\nWe pay out a substantial proportion of fixed remuneration in shares to ensure our Board members focus on long-term, sustainable performance. To maximise this effect, these shares are subject to a five-year lock-up period (during which the shares cannot be sold).\n\n## Creating a sense of ownership\n\nWe believe in aligning our interests with those of our shareholders through a high level of personal share ownership. Our share ownership guidelines stipulate that Management Board members must hold Van Lanschot Kempen shares with a value equal to or above the cash portion of two years of their gross salary (for as long as they remain in office). If the share price is not performing, the Board members must keep increasing their holdings.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board evaluates both the performance of the Management Board as a whole and that of the individual Management Board members on an annual basis. Performance discussions are held with the individual members. The Management Board also annually evaluates its own functioning as a whole and that of its individual members. If an individual Management Board member underperforms, they are held accountable.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has developed a set of KPIs focusing on longterm value creation. They are in line with the company's values and will be reassessed from time to time. The KPIs that are relevant from a strategy and stakeholder perspective are disclosed in the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 23-44. These KPIs are also applicable to the members of the Management Board. Van Lanschot Kempen aims for the KPIs and performance management applicable to the Management Board to be fully aligned with the rest of the organisation.",

The key features of our remuneration policy are as follows:\n\n|                                   | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed salary - cash               | To reflect the scale and complexity of our  company, enabling us to attract and retain  the highest calibre talent needed to  continue the company's growth                                                         | Fixed salary in cash, paid during the year in 12 instalments, taking into  account the following factors: - Scope of responsibilities;  - Business performance, scarcity of talent, economic climate and market  conditions;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Fixed salary - shares             | To reflect the scale and complexity of our  company, enabling us to attract and retain  the highest-calibre talent needed; to align  rewards with long-term sustainable  performance; and to align the interests of | Fixed salary in shares, paid in one instalment: - A lock-up period of five years applies to these shares.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Indexation                        | Pay for performance, labour market  developments and to compensate for  inflationary pressure                                                                                                                       | The remuneration of the Management Board can be increased annually at  the discretion of the Supervisory Board.

From this date, the role was split into two separate positions: Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Risk Officer (CRO). Jeroen Kroes was appointed by the AGM as the new CFO and Wendy Winkelhuijzen as the new CRO. Jeroen and Wendy both started their careers at Van Lanschot Kempen. Their compensation is fully in line with the Management Board remuneration policy.\n\nThe Supervisory Board indexed the fixed remuneration of the members of the Management Board. The indexation was applied on 1 January 2022 and amounted to 2%, in line with the wider workforce. It was granted fully in cash, in accordance with the Management Board remuneration policy. The remuneration paid to the Management Board in 2022 and 2021 is presented in the table on the following page.",

We have not made use of any discretion when applying the policy, except for using the indexation clause for the Management Board.\n\n## Total remuneration management\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Management Board periodically, taking into account internal and external considerations.\n\n## Internal pay ratios, fairness and wider workforce considerations\n\nWhen adopting the Management Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company attaching importance to the need for a sound pay ratio. The development of the pay ratio is discussed annually with the Works Council.\n\nA comparison of the CEO's remuneration package and the average remuneration 12 of an employee within Van Lanschot Kempen results in a pay ratio of 11:1, the same as in 2021 and in line with the industry benchmark.\n\nAs part of the review of Management Board remuneration, we take into account the remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce. This includes considering the structure of remuneration packages at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how these evolve across the different levels of the organisation. For more detailed information on Management Board remuneration versus remuneration for the wider workforce (as well as company performance), see 'Supplementary disclosure related to Management Board remuneration' on page 93.\n\n## External considerations\n\nWe periodically assess the remuneration levels of the Management Board versus external market levels. For this purpose, we use a well-balanced, focused group of companies, which reflects our talent market for Management Board positions. This serves as one of many checks in the determination of remuneration levels.",

        "page_content": "We are convinced that market capitalisation is not the deciding factor for attracting talent. Our talent market is much broader than that of our direct competitors. This is evidenced by four of our current Management Board members, who were hired from top-notch larger firms. The relevant market includes both financial services companies and non-financial industry companies, both Dutch and international, and companies that are similar to and larger in size than Van Lanschot Kempen. The relative size of the company versus our competitors drives the need to attract better people than the competition. Prompted by our business strategy, we are willing to pay for the best people in the market. Typically, this talent comes from companies that are larger than ours.\n\nOur external reference market consists of the following types of companies:\n\n- -Specialist wealth management companies : We are a (highly) specialist company and need to be able to attract specialists to further grow the business. As there are no other standalone specialist wealth management companies of comparable size in the Netherlands, we look at companies active in western Europe. We take into account standalone companies, broadly comparable in terms of number of employees and type of professional setting.\n- -Dutch banks : Although not all of the country's banks are directly comparable in terms of activities and size, these companies are subject to the same regulatory framework and are part of the same public debate.\n- -Other Dutch companies : Although other banks and specialist wealth management companies are important from a talent market perspective, our talent pool does not only consist of financial services companies. For example, in pursuing our wealth management strategy, professional qualifications are key - including the ability to adapt to technological changes. Because of this, our peer group also consists of other, non-financial Dutch companies - for example, in the technology sector. These companies are larger than ours, reflecting our experience that talent suitable for our Management Board is likely to be attracted from (and lost to) larger companies.\n\nThe peer group is in line with requirements as laid down in the Dutch Banking Code. This code prescribes that the peer group should be composed of comparable positions both inside and outside the financial industry, including the relevant international context. In preparation for the approval of our remuneration policy at the 2024 AGM, we will review our Management Board peer group. The composition of the peer group currently is set out in the following table.\n\n| Specialist wealth  management  companies   | Dutch banks   | Other Dutch  companies   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|\n| BIL                                        | ABN AMRO      | Aegon                    |\n| Degroof Petercam                           | ING Groep     | ASML                     |\n| Julius B\u00e4r                                 | NIBC Bank     | Boskalis  Westminster    |\n| Quintet                                    | Rabobank      | DSM                      |\n| Lombard Odier                              | Rabobank      | KPN                      |\n| Vontobel                                   | Rabobank      | NN Group Vopak           |\n\nAs for the Management Board's overall total remuneration level, the objective is to remain competitive and to occupy a position below the median of the peer group. When establishing more specific positioning against market data, we take into account that some of the companies are substantially larger than ours. As a result, the current remuneration packages of our Management Board members occupy a position far below the median of the peer group.\n\nFollowing feedback from stakeholders, in 2019 we asked Willis Towers Watson (WTW) to update the market assessment for the Management Board. No changes were made in the companies selected, but we asked WTW to benchmark one level deeper in the organisation for the larger firms in the peer group (at similar job levels). This means that our CEO was compared with positions that report to the CEO (CEO-1 level); for the other Management Board positions, divisional heads were included that report to CEO-1 level (i.e. CEO-2 level). As these positions do not have formal board responsibilities, a standard board premium (in line with market practice) was applied to the base salary levels. Based on this updated analysis, we found that the CEO and CFO are still placed below median market levels (in the 40 th percentile for the CEO and 44 th percentile for the CFO), while the other Management Board members are placed at median market levels.\n\n## Management Board performance\n\nAs indicated in our approach to remuneration, the performance of the Management Board is assessed based on financial and non-financial KPIs. For 2022, the following KPIs (selected from a strategic and stakeholder perspective) were included in the KPIs of the Management Board. For a comprehensive overview of the Management Board KPIs, see the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 25-44.",

The remuneration of the Supervisory Board is summarised in the tables below.\n\n| Remuneration of the  Supervisory Board   | Chair   | Vice-Chair   | Member   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|--------------|----------|\n| Supervisory Board                        | \u20ac90,000 | \u20ac70,000      | \u20ac60,000  |\n| Audit Committee                          | \u20ac15,000 |              | \u20ac10,000  |\n| Risk and Compliance  Committee           | \u20ac15,000 |              | \u20ac10,000  |\n| Remuneration  Committee                  | \u20ac10,000 |              | \u20ac7,000   |\n| Selection and  Appointment  Committee    | \u20ac10,000 |              | \u20ac6,000   |\n\n| Remuneration of the Supervisory  Board (\u20ac1,000)   | 2022   |   2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Frans Blom                                        | 117    |    111 |\n| Manfred Schepers                                  | 95     |     95 |\n| Bernadette Langius                                | 80     |     80 |\n| Maarten Muller                                    | 76     |     76 |\n| Lex van Overmeire                                 | 85     |     85 |\n| Karin Bergstein                                   | 77     |     77 |\n| Brigitte Boone  (from 22 September 2021)          | 76     |     19 |\n| Jeanine Helthuis (until 27 May 2021)              | -      |     35 |\n\nNo share-based remuneration, loans, advances or guarantees have been granted to the members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board peer group is composed of Dutch banks and Dutch listed companies that operate a two-tier board structure. As a specialist wealth manager in the financial sector, Van Lanschot Kempen wants to be able to appoint and retain high-quality Supervisory Board members. If we change our remuneration policy in the future, we will also review our Supervisory Board peer group.\n\n| Dutch banks   | Dutch companies with a two-tier board structure   | Dutch companies with a two-tier board structure   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| ABN AMRO      | Aegon                                             | KPN                                               |\n| ING Groep     | Ahold Delhaize                                    | NN Group                                          |\n| NIBC Bank     | Akzo Nobel                                        | Philips                                           |\n| Rabobank      | ASML Holding Boskalis Westminster                 | Randstad Holding SBM Offshore                     |\n| Rabobank      | DSM                                               | Vopak                                             |\n\n## Remuneration of other employees\n\nWe aim to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is competitive, performance-related and fair. Our remuneration policy for other employees is in line with our strategy and purpose, and contributes to long-term value creation.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nEmployees' fixed remuneration reflects their relevant work experience and organisational responsibilities. Our job and career framework consistently links the weight of each job to a pay line. The pay lines are based on external market data and are differentiated to ensure we pay competitive salaries across the organisation. The pay lines are fully transparent, promote better pay-for-performance focus, and have been set up with clear guidelines on pay-related decisions and governance.\n\n## Equal pay\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen operates a merit-based remuneration policy, seeking not to discriminate on the basis of gender, age, nationality, social status or cultural background. We periodically investigate this and, if necessary, make adjustments to equalise pay. For the second year, in 2022 we further analysed the gender pay gap at different levels in the organisation to determine whether there are any unexplained differences. As a result, we concluded that our unexplained (corrected) gender pay gap is 2.7%, which is a significant improvement on our 2021 score of 4%. Our target is to reduce this to less than 2%.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nOur variable remuneration policies cover all employees (excluding the members of the Management Board). Each individual grant is subject to meeting the criteria as described in this section.",

        "page_content": "Our variable remuneration policies comply with all relevant laws and regulations. The average variable remuneration of all Van Lanschot Kempen employees who work (largely) in the Netherlands may not and does not exceed 20% of their fixed remuneration. For a small number of employees who are not directly engaged in providing financial services to consumers, we may grant variable remuneration of up to 100% of fixed remuneration. These deviations require separate approval from the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Variable remuneration funding\n\nThe Management Board annually establishes a variable remuneration pool, from which individual variable remuneration awards are made. The size of the pool (or the pool funding) depends on achievement of financial and nonfinancial KPIs, and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Once the size of the variable remuneration pool has been established, the Management Board decides how the pool will be allocated.\n\n## Variable remuneration allocation\n\nThe individual allocation of variable remuneration depends on individual performance, market competitiveness and special factors.\n\nIndividual performance is measured by assessing the achievement of KPIs, as set at the beginning of the year. These indicators can be financial and non-financial, with some departments applying only non-financial criteria. For the departments that use both financial and non-financial indicators, at least 50% of the allocation of any variable remuneration is based on non-financial criteria, such as showing the desired professional behaviour, improving client satisfaction, developing new products or solutions for clients, and improving internal processes, policies or systems. The financial performance indicators include nothing that might encourage irresponsible risk-taking.\n\nVariable remuneration is only awarded if:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows;\n- -It is justified by Van Lanschot Kempen's performance, the relevant client segment and the individual employee;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen meets the prevailing buffer requirements under the EU's Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) and its implementing legislation;\n- -The risks taken have been reassessed and no material risks have occurred that were not expected or factored in;\n- -The employee has received a good performance assessment, has met compliance targets, has not been subject to disciplinary measures, and has not taken any risks that fall outside Van Lanschot Kempen's accepted risk appetite.\n\n## Variable remuneration pay-out\n\nVariable remuneration up to \u20ac50,000 gross is paid out in cash directly. Above this amount, 50% of any variable remuneration is paid out directly, whereas the other 50% is deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned above).\n\nThe Management Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, hold or claw back all or part of the pay-out if pay-outs have taken place on the basis of incorrect information, or have been made in conflict with the variable remuneration policy and/or applicable legislation and regulations:\n\n- -Deferred, conditional, variable remuneration previously awarded to an employee (or former employee), if payment of the variable remuneration would be considered unfair or unreasonable (hold back);\n- -Unconditional variable remuneration previously paid to an employee (or former employee). This might occur if, for instance, payment was based on incorrect information about performance or about the conditions on which the variable remuneration depended (claw back).\n\n## Remuneration in 2022\n\nVariable remuneration totalling \u20ac21.5 million was awarded to employees (including identified staff) over 2022 (2021: \u20ac23.0 million). Six people received total annual remuneration of over \u20ac1 million in 2022 (2021: five people).\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nOur 2011 long-term share plan allows us to award variable remuneration in the form of Van Lanschot Kempen shares to certain key employees (including identified staff). In this case, 60% of each award is unconditional, whereas 40% of each award is deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned above).\n\n## Matching Share Plan\n\nIn 2022, a new employee participation plan was introduced, known as the Matching Share Plan. The plan offers an attractive investment opportunity in Van Lanschot Kempen, as well as the chance to share in the company's successes. Employees are able to purchase Van Lanschot Kempen shares, up to a maximum amount of \u20ac15,000 (as of 2023). The shares are locked up for five years and can therefore be offered at an 18.5% discount. If the employee is still employed after one year, a matching amount is awarded in shares. In 2022, the maximum value of shares that would be matched by the company was \u20ac2,500; in 2023, this limit will be raised to \u20ac3,500. We are proud that more than 70% of our employees are now also shareholders in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Partnership for leadership\n\nIn summer 2022, the Van Lanschot Kempen Partnership was launched: a long-term participation plan for key senior employees. For more information, see \"Partnership for leadership\" on page 34.\n\n## Pensions\n\nSince 2020, all our employees have been participating in Van Lanschot Kempen's defined contribution pension plan. Management Board members do not participate in this plan as they receive an individual pension contribution. We monitor external developments regarding alignment between executive pensions and broader employee pension arrangements, and the possible impact that these may have in the Netherlands.\n\n## Remuneration policy for identified staff\n\nIdentified staff are employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the business. For these employees, performance measurement is the same as for other employees, but additional rules apply for the pay-out of variable remuneration in order to align the interests and risks of the employee with those of the company.",

        "page_content": "As a general rule, any pay-out to identified staff is made 50% in cash and 50% in Van Lanschot Kempen shares. As an exception 18 to this, the variable remuneration of identified staff working at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management is paid 50% in cash and 50% in a flexible mix of Van Lanschot Kempen shares and investments in funds managed.\n\nA lock-up period of one year applies to the shares that have become unconditional. In all cases, 60% of the award is paid out unconditionally (both the cash part and the non-cash part), whereas 40% is conditionally deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on a reassessment of the five conditions mentioned for any award of regular variable remuneration. If this reassessment leads to an adjustment of the deferred remuneration, the hold and/or claw-back system applies.\n\n## Remuneration policy governance\n\nThe Management Board sets the remuneration policy for employees, based on the advice of the Human Resource Management, Finance, Reporting & Control, Risk Management and Compliance departments. These, together with the Internal Audit department, have an important part to play in setting up, adjusting, implementing and reviewing our variable remuneration policy. They advise the Management and Supervisory Boards and report to them on their conclusions.\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for implementing the remuneration policy. The Supervisory Board approves the variable remuneration policy, including its general principles, and oversees its implementation. Approval by the Supervisory Board is also required for the variable remuneration pools, any significant 19 individual variable remuneration, and for individual variable remuneration proposed for employees designated as identified staff. The Supervisory Board's Remuneration Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's decision-making on remuneration and advises it in this area.\n\nMore information about the remuneration policy for identified staff can be found in our 2022 Pillar 3 disclosure, available on our website from 9 March 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV is a listed public limited company under Dutch law, governed by a two-tier board. The Management Board is responsible for managing the company, while the Supervisory Board oversees the policies pursued by the Management Board, and the general conduct of affairs at the company and its associated business. The Supervisory Board advises the Management Board on the performance of its duties.\n\n## Corporate governance structure\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a structuurvennootschap . Under Dutch corporate law this means that in addition to the tasks already mentioned, the Supervisory Board is responsible for appointing and dismissing the Management Board and for approving some of its decisions. Both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board report to Van Lanschot Kempen's general meeting.\n\nThe Articles of Association and various other regulations and documents relating to corporate governance can be found at vanlanschotkempen.com/en/governance and vanlanschotkempen.com/management-supervision.\n\n## Management Board\n\nThe Management Board of Van Lanschot Kempen is responsible for the continuity of the company. It focuses on long-term value creation for the company and takes into account stakeholders' interests that are relevant in this context. The Management Board is responsible for the management of the company, and its duties include drawing up and achieving Van Lanschot Kempen's purpose, its strategy and related risk profile, its goals and the pattern of its results, while also attending to the environmental and social aspects of doing business that are relevant to the company. In strategic decisions, the Management Board takes all material environmental and social factors into account. Periodically, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, it determines the financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) for Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe Supervisory Board notifies the general meeting of any proposed appointment of a member of the Management Board. Appointment of a member of the Management Board is subject to the approval of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). A member is appointed by the Supervisory Board. The maximum term for appointment or reappointment is four years. The Supervisory Board may dismiss a member of the Management Board at any time, but only after consulting the general meeting.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nIn performing its duties, the Supervisory Board focuses on the interests of the company and its associated business. The members of Van Lanschot Kempen's Supervisory Board are appointed by the general meeting, in accordance with the provisions set out in Article 23 of Van Lanschot Kempen's Articles of Association. Appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board is subject to the approval of DNB. Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a term of four years and may be reappointed for one further fouryear period. A member of the Supervisory Board may\n\nsubsequently be reappointed again for a period of two years, and this appointment may be extended by another two years. In the event of reappointment after eight years, the reasons for reappointment should be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nA member of the Supervisory Board may only be dismissed by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal with due observance of Article 161(2) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In addition, the general meeting may pass a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board as a whole, in accordance with Article 161(a) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Such a resolution results in the immediate dismissal of all members of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity policy\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has drawn up an inclusion and diversity policy, which is available on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/inclusion-and-diversity under \"Inclusion and Diversity Policy\".\n\nUnlocking the potential of diversity first and foremost requires the creation of an inclusive environment, where the distinctive qualities of each individual are welcomed and valued. We aim for diversity not only in terms of gender, nationality, age, educational background, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, ethnic background, disability or distance to the labour market, but also across personal experiences, characteristics, socio-economic backgrounds and the different skills that people bring. We recognise the true value of having diverse perspectives at the table, and also realise it takes time to learn and adapt to get there.\n\nWe intend to increase - on an annual basis - the number of people working with us with a disability or distance to the labour market, and also with an international background. We have set specific targets with respect to gender diversity based on the Act to achieve a more balanced male/female ratio on management and supervisory boards, which came into force on 1 January 2022. We aim for at least one-third women and one-third men in both our Management and Supervisory Boards, and for at least 30% women and 30% men in senior staff positions. For more information about gender diversity in senior staff positions, the action plan and the inclusion and diversity policy for employees, see \"Inclusion and diversity\" on page 31.\n\nWith regard to the composition of our Management and Supervisory Boards, we aim for a reasonable balance across multiple forms of diversity, but do not find it appropriate to set specific diversity targets across all dimensions. That said, we aim to ensure that the combined profiles of the respective Board members enables them to collectively execute their range of responsibilities and duties towards Van Lanschot Kempen to the best of their abilities, taking into account the nature of the business and its activities.\n\nIn implementing our inclusion and diversity policy for the Management and Supervisory Boards, the individual profiles drawn up for vacancies on these Boards take into account the Boards' profiles and the relevant inclusion and diversity criteria and objectives. These profiles form the basis for the recruitment and selection of new members of the Supervisory and Management Boards. These criteria and",

        "page_content": "objectives are also taken into account when evaluating the performance of the Supervisory and Management Boards.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets the objectives of our inclusion and diversity policy, with its diverse composition in terms of gender, age, nationality, characteristics, educational background, personal experiences and skills that each member brings. This composition enables the Supervisory Board as a group to carry out its responsibilities and duties effectively. The following areas of expertise are represented in the Supervisory Board: executive experience, strategy formulation and execution, banking and finance, clients and markets, audit, financial reporting, risk management, IT, digitalisation, transformation, sustainability (social and environmental), legal, compliance and remuneration. The Supervisory Board currently has seven members, three of whom are female. This means that 42.9% of the positions on the Supervisory Board are held by women and that the target for at least one-third of its members to be female/ male, as included in the inclusion and diversity policy, has been met.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded that the composition of the Management Board meets the objectives of our inclusion and diversity policy in most respects. The composition is complementary and there is a sufficient degree of diversity with regard to age, educational background, personal experiences and skills. The gender diversity of the Management Board improved in 2022, as it now has one female member (16.7% women). However, this also means that the target of one-third women has not yet been met.\n\nIn order to achieve the gender diversity targets for the Management Board, an action plan has been drawn up, the main elements of which are set out below.\n\n## Inflow - recruitment measures:\n\n- -The final shortlist for Management Board positions should be 50% male and 50% female.\n- -A clear view must be established on the potential external pipeline for talent that might be suitable for future appointment as a member of the Management Board. For this purpose, specialist headhunters, agencies and/or networks will be used.\n- -The requirements for profiles to be drawn up for vacancies in the Management Board will take into account \"diversity in all its forms,\" as defined in the inclusion and diversity policy.\n\n## Through-flow and retention - promotion and development measures:\n\n- -A thorough succession planning process has been set up in order to maintain a clear view of the potential internal pipeline of female talent.\n- -Initiatives will be further developed to strengthen the internal pipeline of potential female talent, including 360-degree assessments, individual coaching and business programmes.\n\nThe elements of the action plan for gender diversity in the Management Board will support us in our efforts to achieve our diversity target for the Management Board, while the timing will depend on the moment that changes in the composition of the Management Board occur. An important component in the process are the profile requirements for members of the Board, whereby \"diversity in all its forms\" will be taken into account.\n\n## Composition and performance of the Management Board\n\nThe Management Board must consist of at least three members, with the actual number set by the Supervisory Board. The composition of the Management Board changed in 2022. On 1 September 2022, Constant Korthout stepped down as member of the Management Board and Chief Financial Officer/Chief Risk Officer (CFO/CRO). These roles were split into two separate positions from 1 September 2022 onwards. As a result of this decision, the Management Board has comprised six members since 1 September 2022. On that date, Jeroen Kroes was appointed as member of the Management Board and CFO, and Wendy Winkelhuijzen was appointed as member of the Management Board and CRO. The Management Board currently comprises Maarten Edixhoven (Chair), Jeroen Kroes (CFO), Wendy Winkelhuijzen (CRO), Arjan Huisman (COO), Richard Bruens (responsible for Client Management & Origination) and Erik van Houwelingen (responsible for Investment Strategies & Solutions).\n\nThe Management Board evaluates its functioning as a whole and that of individual Board members at least once a year. The Supervisory Board discusses, at least once a year, the performance of the Management Board as a whole and members' performance individually. For more information about the evaluation of the Management Board's performance by the Supervisory Board, see \"Report of the Supervisory Board\" on page 78.\n\n## Composition and performance of the Supervisory Board and its committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has a minimum of three members and a maximum of nine. Currently, the Supervisory Board comprises Frans Blom (Chair), Manfred Schepers (ViceChair), Karin Bergstein, Brigitte Boone, Bernadette Langius, Maarten Muller and Lex van Overmeire. At the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 25 May 2022, Maarten Muller was reappointed as a member of the Supervisory Board until the day that the AGM is held in 2026.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members to prepare the Board's decision-making: the Audit Committee, the Risk and Compliance Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Selection and Appointment Committee. These committees advise the Supervisory Board on matters relating to their respective areas of interest. For more information about the committees and their composition, see \"Report of the Supervisory Board\" on page 78.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile 1 for its size and composition, taking into account the nature and activities of the business associated with Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries, and the required expertise and",

The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance, that of its committees and that of individual Supervisory Board members, at least once a year without members of the Management Board being present. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance with independent support once every three years. One of the conclusions of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment is that the composition of the Board complies with the requirements set out in the Board's profile. For more information about the conclusions of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment of their performance in 2022, see \"Report of the Supervisory Board\" on page 78.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2016 2 (the Code) came into force starting in the 2017 financial year, and contains principles and best practice provisions that regulate relations between management board, supervisory board and shareholders (including the general meeting). The Code aims to define responsibilities for long-term value creation, risk control, effective management and supervision, remuneration, and relationships with shareholders and other stakeholders. We fully complied with the Code in the 2022 reporting year. On 20 December 2022, the new Corporate Governance Code was published. In 2023, we will explore and take any necessary action to comply with this new Code by the end of 2023.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code 3 contains principles on sound and ethical business operations, governance, risk policy, audit and remuneration policy. The Banking Code applies to activities performed in, and aimed at, the Netherlands by banks with registered offices in the Netherlands and which hold a banking licence issued by DNB. It therefore applies to Van Lanschot Kempen because we hold a banking licence in the Netherlands.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen complied with the Banking Code in 2022. An explanation (in Dutch) of how Van Lanschot Kempen applied the Banking Code during the reporting year is provided on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en/ governance.\n\n## Capital structure and shares\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's authorised share capital consists of 150 million shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1 each, divided into 75 million Class A ordinary shares and 75 million Class C preference shares. Our outstanding capital consisted entirely of Class A ordinary shares on 31 December 2022; a total of 41,361,668 Class A ordinary shares had been issued. There were no outstanding Class C preference shares in 2022.\n\nOn 22 December 2022, Van Lanschot Kempen announced its intention to acquire the remaining 30% of the shares in Mercier Vanderlinden. This stake will be paid for in cash (53%) and newly issued shares (47%) under a lock-up provision until 2030. As a result, Van Lanschot Kempen will issue more than 1.5 million new Class A ordinary shares in 2023. Following the transaction, Mercier Vanderlinden's partners will jointly own more than 3% of the shares in\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen, with a lock-up period until 2030. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023.\n\n## Depositary receipts for shares\n\nOver 99.99% of Class A ordinary shares in issue are held by Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting Administratiekantoor'), which has issued depositary receipts for these shares.\n\nThe receipts have been listed on the official market of the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 1999. A depositary receipt can be converted into its underlying share without any restrictions, although administrative costs may be charged. Stichting Administratiekantoor fully complies with Principle 4.4 of the Code, which specifies that 'Depositary receipts for shares can be a means of preventing a majority (including a chance majority) of shareholders from controlling the decision-making process as a result of absenteeism at a general meeting. Depositary receipts for shares should not be issued as an anti-takeover protective measure.'\n\nStichting Administratiekantoor grants proxies so that holders of depositary receipts can always exercise their voting rights. In the case of shares for which Stichting Administratiekantoor has not granted proxies to the holders of depositary receipts and for which no voting instructions have been received, Stichting Administratiekantoor's Board decides how the votes are to be cast. Stichting Administratiekantoor exercises the voting rights in the interest of the holders of depositary receipts for shares, taking into account the interest of Van Lanschot Kempen, the enterprise associated therewith and all parties concerned. Its Board has three members and is independent of Van Lanschot Kempen. It appoints its own members, without requiring the approval of Van Lanschot Kempen. Before appointing a member, the Board allows the holders of depositary receipts for shares the opportunity to recommend candidates for appointment as members of the Board. A meeting of holders of depositary receipts takes place at least once every two years. At this meeting, the Board reports on its activities, vacancies in the Board, and candidates the Board intends to appoint as members of the Board. Once every two years, the Board requests the holders of depositary receipts at this meeting to confirm their confidence in the Board. At the meeting that was held on 16 November 2022, holders of depositary receipts confirmed this. The Board reports on its activities annually. This report can be found on page 253.\n\n## Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nA call option contract has been agreed between Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting preferente aandelen') and Van Lanschot Kempen, under which Stichting preferente aandelen was granted the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. A general meeting, at which a proposal to redeem the preference shares will be placed on the agenda, is to be convened within 12 months.",

        "page_content": "The following circumstances may lead to the issuance of Class C preference shares:\n\n- -A concentration of shares or depositary receipts for shares in Van Lanschot Kempen as a result of purchases on the stock market or the purchase of blocks of shares, other than as a pure investment;\n- -Merger talks that do not lead to an agreement;\n- -The announcement of a public bid, whether or not in combination with the above circumstances;\n- -A proposal by a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts for shares to place an item on the agenda that represents a potential threat to Van Lanschot Kempen's continuity, identity and/or independence.\n\n## Interests in Van Lanschot Kempen notifiable under Chapter 5.3 of the Financial Supervision Act\n\nPursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, shareholders and holders of depositary receipts of Van Lanschot Kempen are required to provide information on their holdings once they cross threshold levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. As of the publication date of this report, Van Lanschot Kempen is not aware of any shareholders or holders of depositary receipts with an interest of 3% or more in Van Lanschot Kempen other than Stichting Administratiekantoor, Romij BV, LDDM Holding BV, Janus Henderson Group plc, FMR LLC and J.B. Meulman. For more information on Van Lanschot Kempen's shareholders, see \"Van Lanschot Kempen shares\" on page 74. Stichting preferente aandelen has reported a potential interest of 100% in Van Lanschot Kempen under the call option agreement between Stichting preferente aandelen and Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nIn 2022, no transactions took place between Van Lanschot Kempen and any natural person or legal entity holding at least 10% of the shares in Van Lanschot Kempen, and which would be material to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or the person/entity involved.\n\n## Rights of shareholders\n\nSince there are exclusively Class A ordinary shares in issue at present, this section only describes the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares and depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe portion of the profit remaining after addition to the reserves is at the disposal of the general meeting. In the event that a loss is incurred over a year, which cannot be covered by a reserve or by some other means, no profit distribution will occur in subsequent years until such time as this loss has been absorbed. A dividend on ordinary shares can only be paid out when the dividend proposal has been approved by the general meeting. Van Lanschot Kempen checks whether the proposed dividend satisfies the European Central Bank's recommendation on dividend payment policies. For more information on our dividend policy, see \"Van Lanschot Kempen shares\" on page 74.\n\n## Pre-emption rights\n\nWhen ordinary shares are issued, each existing holder of ordinary shares has a pre-emption right proportionate to the aggregate nominal amount of the existing holding of ordinary shares. Class A ordinary shares are issued to holders of Class A ordinary shares. The same applies to the\n\ngrant of rights to acquire ordinary shares. Pre-emption rights can be limited or excluded by resolution of the Management Board, any such resolution being subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The relevant authority of the Management Board ends as soon as its authority to issue shares expires (see 'Share issues').\n\nShareholders do not have any pre-emption rights on shares issued in exchange for a non-cash contribution. Nor do shareholders have any pre-emption rights on shares or depositary receipts for those shares issued to employees of Van Lanschot Kempen or another group company.\n\n## Special rights of shareholders\n\nThere are no special statutory control rights attached to shares in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen signed a shareholder agreement with LDDM Holding BV in 2011. In it, LDDM Holding affirms that it will respect Van Lanschot Kempen's independence. LDDM Holding will not cooperate with the acquisition by a third party of a shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen exceeding 25% of the issued share capital without the approval of the Management and Supervisory Boards. In the event of any future share issues, Van Lanschot Kempen will give LDDM Holding the opportunity, subject to certain conditions, to keep its relative shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen at the same level. As long as LDDM Holding retains an interest of at least 7.5% in Van Lanschot Kempen, it has the right to recommend one person for appointment as a member of the Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen. Maarten Muller currently serves on the Supervisory Board on LDDM Holding's recommendation.\n\n## Restrictions on voting rights and deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has not imposed any restrictions on the exercise of voting rights. In principle, voting rights are exercised at the general meeting by the shareholder or the person authorised by the shareholder to that end. A shareholder is entitled to vote at the general meeting if the shares in question are registered in the shareholder's name on the registration date (see 'General meeting'). Holders of depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares who register on time to attend the general meeting are granted a proxy by Stichting Administratiekantoor. They can use this proxy at the general meeting to exercise the voting rights on the shares held by Stichting Administratiekantoor, and in exchange for which depositary receipts were issued. Proxies will be provided when the depositary receipt holders sign the attendance list prior to the start of the meeting or, in the case of a hybrid meeting, at the moment they log in to the designated platform to attend the virtual meeting. If the depositary receipt holder's right to attend the meeting is to be exercised by a representative authorised in writing, Stichting Administratiekantoor will grant a proxy to the representative. Shareholders and holders of depositary receipts for shares are also offered the opportunity to issue a voting instruction to an independent third party prior to the general meeting. The notice convening the relevant general meeting will state to whom this voting instruction should be sent and what the deadline is for submission.",

        "page_content": "## Share issues\n\nThe extent of the Management Board's authority to decide on a share issue (subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board) is determined by a resolution of the general meeting. The duration and granting of this authority are also determined by resolution of the general meeting and may not exceed five years. The Management Board's authority to issue ordinary shares, including the granting of rights to acquire these shares, was extended at the AGM held on 25 May 2022 for a period of 18 months from the date of that meeting. The authority to issue these shares is limited to 10% of the issued capital.\n\n## Repurchase of shares\n\nRepurchases of paid-up shares in the company or depositary receipts for such shares, other than for no consideration, may take place if the general meeting has authorised the Management Board to this effect. This authorisation applies for up to a maximum of 18 months. Repurchase occurs pursuant to a decision by the Management Board, subject to Supervisory Board and DNB approval.\n\nThe Management Board was authorised at the AGM held on 25 May 2022 to repurchase paid-up ordinary shares in the company or depositary receipts for these shares, by buying such shares on the stock market or otherwise, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued capital at the date of authorisation, subject to Supervisory Board approval. This authority has been granted for a period of 18 months from the date of the meeting.\n\n## Transfer of shares and depositary receipts\n\nThe Articles of Association and the conditions of administration do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of Class A ordinary shares or depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nA resolution to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen may only be adopted based on a proposal by the Management Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board. If a proposal to amend the Articles of Association is presented to the general meeting, a copy of the proposal will be made available to the shareholders and holders of depositary receipts prior to the meeting.\n\n## General meeting\n\nEach voting shareholder and depositary receipt holder is authorised, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing, to attend the general meeting, to address the meeting and to exercise their voting rights. A registration date applies to each general meeting, which is the 28 th day prior to that meeting. The registration date determines who qualifies as a voting shareholder or depositary receipt holder for the relevant general meeting. The notice convening the meeting states the registration date, the way in which shareholders and depositary receipt holders can register and how they can exercise their rights, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing.\n\nShareholders and depositary receipt holders or their representatives are only admitted to the meeting if they have informed Van Lanschot Kempen in writing of their intention to attend, and if this has been done in the manner described in the notice convening the meeting. Access to the meeting is only possible if the relevant shares or depositary\n\nreceipts are registered in the name of the shareholder or the depositary receipt holder on the registration date. Representatives must also present a written proxy. A written proxy may be sent electronically. Each share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the general meeting.\n\nThe powers of the general meeting include the following:\n\n- -Approving decisions of the Management Board to make important changes to the identity or nature of the company or the business;\n- -Appointing members of the Supervisory Board on the Supervisory Board's recommendation;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board;\n- -Passing a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Management Board;\n- -Approving schemes in the form of shares and/or rights to acquire shares for the Management Board;\n- -Adopting the financial statements;\n- -Disposing of the profit remaining after dividend has been distributed to any outstanding Class C preference shares, and after the decision has been made to add all or part of the profit to the reserves;\n- -Discharging the Management Board;\n- -Discharging the Supervisory Board;\n- -Granting the Management Board the authority to issue shares and to limit or exclude pre-emption rights on the issue of shares;\n- -Granting the Management Board the authority to repurchase the company's own shares;\n- -Resolving to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen, to dissolve Van Lanschot Kempen, or to effect a legal merger or demerger of Van Lanschot Kempen, following a proposal to that effect by the Management Board which has been approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, the general meeting has an advisory vote with regard to the remuneration report.\n\n## Main features of Van Lanschot Kempen's management and control system\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks. This includes the management of financial reporting risks, to ensure reliable financial reporting and financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and which comply with the prevailing legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen applies the three lines of defence model for the management of risk. The first line of defence is operational management, responsible for day-to-day risk management. The second line of defence is provided by departments such as Risk Management and Compliance, which oversee the first line. The Internal Audit department acts as the third line of defence, providing an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the internal risk management and control systems. The three lines of defence model provides the Management Board with a reasonable degree of certainty as to how the internal risk management and control system is functioning, including the efficacy of both the first and second lines.",

        "page_content": "The Internal Audit department is responsible for carrying out operational and IT audits. All of its reports are submitted to (members of) the Management Board. Internal Audit, Compliance and Risk Management ensure adequate followup and prioritisation of actions to improve the internal risk management and control system. If necessary, supplementary control measures are defined to mitigate risk sufficiently.\n\nThe risk & control framework's effectiveness is evaluated by the Risk Management and Compliance departments, while the Internal Audit department also assesses its quality and effectiveness through audit engagements. The results of these evaluations feature in these departments' quarterly reports.\n\nFor more detailed information on risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen, see \"Risk and capital management\" on page 59. The financial statements also include a more detailed explanation of risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen: see 'Risk management', beginning on page 131.\n\n## Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for the design and operation of an adequate system of internal control for Van Lanschot Kempen's financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting. The financial statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and must comply with the prevailing legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has processes and tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -The Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles regarding financial accounting;\n- -A risk & control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -Evaluation of the functioning of the internal risk management and control system by the Internal Audit department. The main findings are discussed with the Management Board, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Management Board, and discussion of the annual report by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn-control statements are provided by the management of the relevant departments. These are based on the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the results of testing procedures for the risk & control framework, the follow-up of the test results and reported risks, and the incidents reported. Risk Management and Compliance evaluated the 2022 in-control statements.\n\nIn 2022, the main findings of the Internal Audit department's quarterly reports were discussed with the Management Board and the Audit Committee. The conclusions of the Audit Committee were subsequently shared with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed about the Management Board's internal control of the organisation, and how it safeguards the integrity of financial information. The subjects considered by the Supervisory Board when assessing the financial statements include the board report and the audit report prepared by the external auditors.\n\nThe key audit findings and other observations cited in the independent external auditors' report were discussed with the Management Board and the Audit Committee, and formed part of the organisation's risk management and control. Non-financial information is subject to internal controls and reviews, whereas the sustainability reporting is drawn up in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and  Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requirements, and is subject to a limited assurance engagement performed by the independent external auditors.\n\n## Statement by the Management Board\n\nIn accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Management Board states that:\n\n- -The management report provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems;\n- -The aforementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies;\n- -Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a 'going concern' basis;\n- -The management report states those material risks and uncertainties that are relevant to expectation of the company's continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report;\n- -Based on the analysis of in-control statements and the quarterly reports from Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit, it is justified to state that the financial statements are free of any material misstatements caused by fraud.\n\n## External auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) were reappointed as Van Lanschot Kempen's external auditors for the 2023 financial year at the AGM held on 25 May 2022. PwC's audit plan for 2022, of which the audit risk assessment is an integral part, was discussed in June 2022 at meetings of the Management Board and the Audit Committee.\n\nPwC issued a board report for 2022 in February 2023. The subjects set out in this board report are in line with the notes included in this annual report with respect to risk management, insofar as these relate to financial reporting risks. The external auditors may be questioned at the AGM in relation to their audit, and will be attending the meeting for this reason. The Management Board and the Audit Committee evaluated the functioning of PwC in January 2023.",

Share plans in 2022 include investment incentives for this partnership.\n\nIn 2021, we acquired a 70% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. The transfer of the remaining shares held with the 30% minority shareholders of Mercier Vanderlinden, i.e. the managing partners, was initially planned for 2025 and 2026.\n\nAt year-end 2022, we agreed to accelerate the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden by Van Lanschot Kempen, subject to regulatory approval. Van Lanschot Kempen will pay 47% in shares for the remaining 30% stake. To this end, it will issue new shares. This is reflected in line item Shares to be issued.

        "page_content": "## Summary of significant accounting principles\n\n## General\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV is an independent specialist wealth manager. Our purpose is to preserve and create wealth for our clients and for society in a sustainable way. Van Lanschot Kempen NV (\"Van Lanschot Kempen\") has its registered office at Hooge Steenweg 29, 5211 JN 'sHertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Van Lanschot Kempen is a public limited company incorporated under Dutch law and registered under number 16038212 at the Chamber of Commerce. Depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares are publicly traded on the Euronext markets.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2022 were prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board on 22 February 2023, and will be submitted to the annual general meeting of shareholders for adoption on 25 May 2023.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Unless stated otherwise, assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost.\n\n## Continuity\n\nThe Management Board has examined the ability of Van Lanschot Kempen to continue its operations and concluded that Van Lanschot Kempen is able to do so for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Management Board is not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on our - i.e. Van Lanschot Kempen's - ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis.\n\n## Economic context\n\nSince the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the war in Ukraine in 2022, there has been a risk of an economic recession. Although the outlook for the economic recovery from the pandemic is positive, the war in Ukraine and subsequent increased inflation, higher interest rates and volatility in the equity markets have heightened uncertainty about the future economic climate. A lot is still unknown about the impact of these developments on the private clients, entrepreneurs and family businesses we - as Van Lanschot Kempen - finance. That said, the impact of current economic circumstances is considered to be limited for Van Lanschot Kempen. During the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, we have not experienced major disquiet among our clients, either existing or new.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has a solid capital and liquidity position. Our capital and liquidity are above our targets and our net result in 2022 amounted to \u20ac84.3 million (2021: \u20ac143.8 million).\n\nIn 2022, the impact on our credit portfolio of the uncertain economic circumstances caused, among other factors, by the war in Ukraine and the Covid pandemic was minor. Even after incorporating a management overlay for these uncertain economic circumstances, the net impact on our credit portfolio has been relatively limited. This is reflected in a decrease in expected credit loss (ECL). The management overlay takes into account uncertainties in the economic outlook/macroeconomic climate which are not (yet) considered to be reflected in the model parameters. For more information, see \"Risk management\", under 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit losses (including sensitivity analyses we have performed).\n\nTo summarise, Van Lanschot Kempen is well able to cope with the uncertain economic circumstances, thanks to its solid capital and liquidity position, and solid financial performance. Considering the above, we can affirm that there are no indications that cast significant doubt over Van Lanschot Kempen's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Functional and reporting currency\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, Van Lanschot Kempen's functional and reporting currency. Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are presented in thousands of euros. The totals may not always match the sum of the individual values due to rounding.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 remain unchanged, except for the adoption of hedge accounting for micro fair value hedges based on IFRS 9, new standards and interpretations effective from 1 January 2022 and the adoption of the amendments to IAS 1 on the disclosure of accounting policies.\n\n## Changes in published IFRS standards and interpretations\n\nThe IFRS standards listed below became effective from 1 January 2022 and have been applied to our financial statements for 2022. Unless stated otherwise, application of these standards had no material impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's equity or result. Application of the amended standards generally entails amendment or expansion of notes.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Reference to the Conceptual Framework\n\nThe amendments are intended to update a reference to the Conceptual Framework without significantly changing the requirements of IFRS 3. The amendments add an exception to the recognition principle of IFRS 3 that requires entities to apply the criteria in IAS 37 or IFRIC 21, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date. At the same time, the amendments add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date. The amendments must be applied prospectively.",

        "page_content": "## Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use - Amendments to IAS 16\n\nThe amendments prohibit entities from deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Instead, an entity recognises the proceeds from selling such items, and the costs of producing those items, in profit or loss.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract Amendments to IAS 37\n\nThe amendments specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. General and administrative costs do not relate directly to a contract and are excluded unless they are explicitly chargeable to the counterparty under the contract.\n\n## Published IFRS standards and interpretations not yet effective\n\nIn addition to the IFRS standards and interpretations referred to above, a number of IFRS standards and interpretations are new or have been amended, and apply to financial statements for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. We have not applied the standards outlined below in the 2022 financial statements. Unless stated otherwise, standards will be applied as soon as they become effective and have been endorsed by the EU.\n\n## Definition of Accounting estimates - Amendments to IAS 8\n\nThe amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. Also, they clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments should provide  guidance for entities in determining whether changes are to be treated as changes in estimates, changes in policies, or errors. The amendments apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of the effective date. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the results or equity of the company.\n\n## Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2\n\nThe amendments provide guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments intend for entities to disclose more useful accounting policy disclosures by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their \"significant\" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their \"material\" accounting policies. In addition, guidance is provided on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.\n\nWe decided to early adopt the amendments to IAS 1 and revisited our accounting policy information to ensure consistency with the amended standard.\n\n## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to IAS 2\n\nThe amendments clarify that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability.\n\nUnder the amendments, the initial recognition exception does not apply to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. It only applies if the recognition of a lease asset and lease liability (or decommissioning a liability or decommissioning an asset component) give rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences that are not equal.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible that the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are not equal (e.g. if the entity is unable to benefit from the tax deductions or if different tax rates apply to the taxable and deductible temporary differences). In such cases, an entity would need to account for the difference between the deferred tax asset and liability in profit or loss.\n\nAn entity should apply the amendments to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, it should also recognise a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the results or equity of the company.\n\n## Significant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWe have identified those accounting policies which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. In the process of applying these accounting policies, we use estimates, assumptions and judgements which can have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on the most recent information available and include the impact of the uncertain economic circumstances caused by developments around the war in Ukraine among other factors. The actual amounts may differ in the future. Where applicable, the impact of the uncertain economic circumstances on assumptions used are explained further in the consolidated financial statements. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the determination of significant influence, fair value of financial instruments, acquisitions, impairments of financial assets, carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.",

        "page_content": "## Determination of significant influence\n\nWe have applied critical judgement to determine significant influence in companies in which we hold minority interests smaller than 20%. Our influence on the financial and operating policy decisions at some minority interests is more in line with that in an associate, e.g. veto rights in decisions on the issuance of new shares and decisions on amendments to the Articles of Association. For that reason, we classify these as minority interests and apply equity accounting instead of IFRS 9 fair value accounting. For further information, see the disclosure on Investments in associates using the equity method.\n\n## Determination of fair value\n\nThe determination of the fair value of financial instruments, in so far as available and provided there is an active market, is based on quoted prices in active markets at the reporting date. For financial assets, the bid price is used; for financial liabilities, the offer price.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market is determined on the basis of cash flow, option and other valuation models. These models are based on the market circumstances prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates mainly relate to future cash flows and discount rates. For the fair value level classification and more details, see 'Risk management', under 14, Fair value.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn the case of acquisitions, it is necessary to determine the fair value of the acquired assets (including any intangible assets and goodwill acquired), as well as of liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position. Estimates are used for this, particularly for those items not traded on an active market. Management consideration is also needed to determine the moment of the change of control and thus the moment of consolidation of an acquired entity.\n\n## Impairments of financial assets\n\nWe recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there has been no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime expected credit loss (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised. The impairments of financial assets are determined as a critical estimate. For more information on deterioration in credit risk, see 'Risk management', under 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss.\n\n## Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nTo measure the recoverable amounts, we calculate the value in use for each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs. This calculation reflects an estimate of future cash flows, base-case scenario analysis and discount rates. Future cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and different types of investigation into possible trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on these estimates include market expectations, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in client relationships, cost structure, trends in interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to\n\nthe industry and sector. In addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life. For more information on the discount rates used, see Note 10, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Other accounting estimates\n\n## Impairments of non-financial assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and its value in use. This fair value less costs to sell is the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the valuation date. To determine whether assets are impaired, the individual assets are allocated to the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified (cashgenerating units). Non-financial assets that have been subject to impairment, other than goodwill paid, are reviewed annually to determine whether the impairment can be reversed. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill paid, are tested for impairment annually by assessing whether there are any indications that these assets are impaired.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset. Estimates are used when determining future taxable profits, since these are inherently subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions of provisions\n\nPension liabilities are determined using actuarial calculations. These calculations use assumptions regarding elements such as the discount rate, future trends in salaries and returns on investments. These assumptions are subject to estimation uncertainty. See Note 17, Provisions.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are determined on the basis of the most recent estimates of the expected costs. The timing of the cash outflow related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and time required to conclude these claims. In determining these provisions, where applicable, we take into consideration the opinion of legal experts.",

        "page_content": "## Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen comprise the financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries. These have been prepared at 31 December 2022 using accounting policies consistent with those used in the previous year, and their financial year is concurrent with the calendar year.\n\nSubsidiaries (including the consolidated structured entities) are associates in which Van Lanschot Kempen exercises decisive control. Van Lanschot Kempen has decisive control over an entity when it has power over that entity and is exposed to or has rights to variable income from its involvement in the entity and is able to use its power over the entity to influence the entity's income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the entity. Factors taken into account include existing and potential voting rights. A right is a material right if its holder is able to exercise that right in practice.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has power over an entity if its existing and potential voting rights amount to more than 50%. If these rights amount to less than 50%, Van Lanschot Kempen determines whether it has power over the entity pursuant to contractual agreements. In making this assessment, a distinction is made between substantive and protective rights. Substantive rights are rights which enable the decision-making power of an enterprise to be influenced directly and which give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. Examples include the right to appoint and dismiss members of the Management Board, and to set the level of their remuneration. Protective rights are rights which protect the interests of an entity in another entity, but which do not directly confer decision-making powers. Protective rights do not give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. When acquiring non-controlling interests, Van Lanschot Kempen in principle includes only protective rights in the contractual agreement. These are rights of approval which enable Van Lanschot Kempen to protect its minority position without acquiring decisionmaking power. Examples of protective rights are rights of approval in respect of the issue of shares and  effecting significant acquisitions.\n\nIntra-group transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of incorporation or acquisition, being the date on which Van Lanschot Kempen acquires control, and are consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nWe consolidate interests in investment funds if we have power over the investment fund and are exposed to or have rights to variable income stemming from our involvement and are able to use our power over the investment fund to influence the variable income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the investment fund. Van Lanschot Kempen takes into account its interest for its own account and its own role, or that of one of its group companies, as fund manager.\n\nIn the case of subsidiaries not fully controlled by Van Lanschot Kempen, the non-controlling interest in equity is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position as a component of total equity. The profit or loss for the reporting period that can be attributed to the non-controlling interest is disclosed separately.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nAcquisitions are recognised using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets (inclusive of any intangible assets not previously recognised in the statement of financial position), liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position.\n\nGoodwill, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition (including assumed debts) and our interest in the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position at the acquisition date, is capitalised as an intangible asset. If this difference is negative (negative goodwill), it is taken directly to the statement of income. Goodwill is not amortised. For more information on its valuation, see Note 10, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nA non-controlling interest in the company acquired is recognised at the fair value prevailing on the acquisition date or at the proportionate share in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired. Results of companies acquired are disclosed in the statement of income from the date at which control is obtained.\n\nAdjustments to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition date which are identified within 12 months of the acquisition may lead to adjustment of goodwill. Adjustments identified after expiry of one year are disclosed in the statement of income.\n\nOn disposal of group companies, the difference between the sale proceeds and the acquisition cost (including goodwill) is included in the statement of income together with any unrealised gain or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional currency\n\nItems in the statement of financial position pertaining to each group company are stated in the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates (i.e. the functional currency).\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of group companies that use a functional currency other than the reporting currency are translated as follows:\n\n- -Assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;\n- -Income and expenses are translated using the rate prevailing on the transaction date;\n- -Remaining exchange-related gains or losses are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nUpon consolidation, exchange-related gains or losses arising from monetary items forming part of a net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity. Exchangerelated gains or losses on borrowings and other items designated as hedging instruments for such investments are also recognised in equity.\n\n## Transactions and line items\n\nOn initial recognition, transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Translation differences arising on the settlement of such transactions or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of income, except where they are recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nIn general, translation differences in the statement of income are included in the result on financial transactions. Translation differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are translated into the reporting currency at the same time as the determination of their fair value. By translation on the reporting date, currency translation differences on nonmonetary items measured at fair value through equity are included in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nNon-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the original transaction date.\n\n## Recognition of financial assets in the statement of financial position\n\nPurchases of financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss whose value is subject to change, or financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, or other financial assets at amortised costs, which are settled according to standard market conventions, are recognised on the transaction date, i.e. the date on which we undertake to purchase or sell the asset concerned. Loans and advances are recognised on the settlement date, i.e. the date on which we receive the asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when:\n\n- -Our rights to the cash flows from the asset expire;\n- -We have retained the right to receive the cash flows from an asset, but have an obligation to pay these in full to a third party under a special agreement;\n- -We have transferred our rights to the cash flows from the asset and have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards;\n- -We have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards but have transferred control over the asset.\n\nIf we have transferred our rights to the cash flows from an asset, but have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset and have not transferred control, the asset is recognised as long as we have continued involvement in the asset.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised as soon as the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Special purpose entities\n\nWe have placed parts of our loan portfolio in special purpose entities (SPEs), which comprise only covered bond companies. If we have effective control over an SPE, it is consolidated. We have control over an entity when we have power over that entity and are exposed to or have rights to variable income from our involvement in the entity and are able to use our power over the entity to influence the entity's income.\n\nThe accounting principles followed by Van Lanschot Kempen are applied when consolidating SPEs.\n\n## Transfers of financial assets\n\nAll or a part of a financial asset is transferred if:\n\n- -The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from that financial asset are transferred; or\n- -The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from that financial asset are retained, but a contractual obligation is assumed to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients under an arrangement.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the effective date of the contract. After initial recognition, the derivative is subsequently remeasured at fair value and changes in value are taken to the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. Fair values are based on stock exchange prices, cash flow models, or option and other valuation models.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge our exposure to risks. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities which are hedged through fair value hedging and which would otherwise be recognised at cost is adjusted for changes in the fair value that can be attributed to the hedged risks. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives not relating to the hedged risks are taken directly to the statement of income.",

        "page_content": "At the inception of a hedge transaction, we formally designate and document the hedge relationship and the financial risk management objective when entering into the hedge transaction. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to risks.\n\nHedges that qualify for hedge accounting are recognised as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability arising as a result of interest rate changes. Changes in the value of the hedging instrument are taken to the statement of income.\n\nAny change in the fair value of the hedged item is also recognised in the statement of income, in so far as the hedging instrument has been effective in the preceding period.\n\nA hedge relationship ends if the hedging instrument is sold, expires or is exercised, or if the hedging transaction no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, with the remaining value adjustment of the hedged item amortised through profit or loss until the end of its term.\n\nWe apply micro fair value hedge accounting and macro fair value hedge accounting.\n\n## Micro fair value hedges\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 onwards, we have applied hedge accounting for micro fair value hedges based on IFRS 9. A fair value hedge is classified as a micro fair value hedge when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively identifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments. Debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income and issued debt securities are hedged for interest rate risk in a micro fair value hedge. Effectiveness is assessed and documented on a monthly basis in order to determine that the hedge has been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it was intended. If necessary, adjustments are made to the hedge relationship.\n\n## Macro fair value hedges\n\nWe apply macro fair value hedges for fixed rate mortgages. A portfolio of mortgages is identified comprising homogeneous loans based on their contractual interest rates, maturity and other risk characteristics. Mortgages within the identified portfolio are allocated into repricing term buckets based on expected repricing dates rather than contractual repricing dates. The hedging instruments are designated appropriately to those repricing term buckets.\n\nSuch hedges are considered to be effective if we may expect, both upon inception and during the term of the hedge, that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, in so far as they relate to the hedged risk, and the actual outcome is within a range of 80-125%. Effectiveness is assessed and documented on a monthly basis in order to determine that the hedge has been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it was intended. We apply the EU carve-out on portfolio fair value hedges.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to fluctuations in the cash flow of an asset, liability or future transaction arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity until the hedged item affects the statement of income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or if it can no longer be designated as a hedge, accumulated gains and losses remain in equity until the expected future transaction is taken to the statement of income. If the expected future transaction is no longer likely to take place, the accumulated result is transferred directly from equity to the statement of income.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nIf the hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset, the embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and treated as separate derivatives when:\n\n- -The economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- -A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative;\n- -The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Day 1 profit\n\nDiscrepancies between the transaction price and the fair value may arise if valuation techniques are applied at the time of the transaction. Such a discrepancy is referred to as a Day 1 profit. Any resulting profit or loss is recognised directly in the statement of income if the valuation method is based on observable inputs in an active market. In the event of unobservable inputs, the gain or loss is amortised over the term of the transaction.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are netted and presented in the consolidated financial statements at the net amount when we have a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. See 3.7, Risk management.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks\n\nCash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks comprise, at nominal value, cash in hand and deposits with a term of less than three months, investments readily convertible into a known amount of cash with an insignificant risk of value changes, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks in respect of which the risk of value changes is insignificant. The amount due from De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) arising from the minimum reserve requirement is also included in this item.",

        "page_content": "## Due from banks\n\nAmounts due from banks are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are carried at fair value. The positive and negative values of derivatives are shown separately on the face of the statement of financial position on the assets side and the liabilities side, respectively. The values of derivatives with a positive and negative value, concluded with the same counterparty, are only netted if the cash flows are settled on a net basis and this is permitted under law. Changes in the value of derivatives are taken directly to the line item Result on financial transactions. If the hedge is completely effective, the net impact on the statement of income is nil. The difference, in so far as this remains within the ranges set, reflects ineffectiveness and is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Derivatives include:\n\n- -The fair value of derivatives held for trading Derivatives held for trading include transactions for own account whereby the aim is to actively sell them in the short term. Client option positions whereby offsetting market transactions are conducted for all option positions held by our clients on a one-on-one basis are also included in this item;\n- Economic hedges are derivatives used to manage risks\n- -Economic hedges without applying hedge accounting;\n- -Structured product derivatives Structured product derivatives are instruments to hedge structured products sold to clients, without application of hedge accounting;\n- -Derivatives with application of hedge accounting These are derivatives used as hedging instruments in the application of hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Additionally, any instrument for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at FVPL. No restrictions are set for sales within the fair value through profit or loss portfolio. Interest earned on these assets is recognised as interest income under Other interest income. All other realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring debt instruments at fair value are recognised under Result on financial transactions. All realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring equity instruments at fair value are recognised under Income from securities and associates.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets from trading activities. These are transactions for our own account whereby the aim is to actively sell these instruments in the short term. Financial assets from trading activities consist of the trading portfolio of both equity instruments and debt instruments. The financial assets from trading activities are recognised at fair value with effect from the trade date and value adjustments are taken to the statement of income under the line item Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect and sell business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at fair value, with fair value adjustments recognised in Other comprehensive income unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Sales as a result of managing everyday liquidity needs, maintaining a particular interest yield profile on the secondary market, or to match the duration and sales required by regulators, are consistent with the objective of the hold to collect and sell portfolio.\n\nUnder FVOCI, a financial asset is measured at its fair value and movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortised cost which are recognised in the income statement. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the income statement and recognised in Result on financial transactions. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest method.\n\n## Loans and advances to the public and private sectors\n\nLoans and advances to the public and private sectors are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and are subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method less any allowance for impairment. The loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised in the statement of income.\n\n## Other financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at amortised cost unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Under this measurement category, the financial asset is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and subsequently recognised at amortised cost less the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and adjusted for any impairment allowance. The impairment is recognised in the statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Investments in associates using the equity method\n\nThese investments have been designated by management as transactions held indefinitely, and as a result of the acquired control can be classified as investments in associates using the equity method. These are investments in entities where we have significant influence but not control. If there is a change in the equity of the associate, we recognise our share in this change and include it in Other comprehensive income. This also applies to results of associates recognised in our statement of income.\n\nIn the first year of investment, investments classified as investments in associates using the equity method are recognised at cost, and where applicable are adjusted for any changes in the value of the associate's individual receivables and payables occurring after the acquisition, measured using the policies applied by Van Lanschot Kempen.",

        "page_content": "The recoverable amount of the investments in associates using the equity method is determined each quarter. The valuation methods applied to assess the carrying value are the capitalisation method (peer group analysis), the discounted cash flow method and the disclosed net asset value method. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nThe capitalisation method determines the value of a business by multiplying the operating profit (EBIT) and the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by a multiplier factor derived from similar listed companies (the peer group), if applicable also taking account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholding. EBIT and EBITDA are adjusted for one-off items where applicable.\n\nThe discounted cash flow method calculates the enterprise value by discounting the forecast operational cash flows at a discount rate for the planning period and a final value based on the extrapolation of the operating profit.\n\nThe discount rate is determined on the basis of the discount rate of listed companies with a high degree of similarity and on the specific characteristics of the company. If applicable, the discounted cash flow method takes account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholdings.\n\nThe company's net debt is then deducted from the value resulting from the capitalisation method and/or discounted cash flow method and multiplied by the share in the capital structure in order to derive the shareholder value from the enterprise value.\n\nThe disclosed net asset value method determines the value of a company based on the statement of financial position.\n\nIf our share in the associate's losses is equal to or exceeds our interest in the associate, no further losses are recognised unless we have assumed obligations or made payments for these associates.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment comprise buildings in own use, right-of-use assets, operation system software and information technology, communication and safety equipment, alterations and furniture and fixtures. Property and equipment are initially carried at cost and subsequently measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairments. The carrying value includes the costs for replacement of part of the existing property as soon as these costs are incurred, but excludes day-to-day servicing costs. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset.\n\nLease contracts which we entered into as a lessee are classified as right-of-use assets. Right-of-use assets are presented as part of Property and equipment in the statement of financial position and are measured at cost, comprising the following:\n\n- -The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n- -Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- -Any initial direct costs;\n- -Restoration costs.\n\nDepreciation is applied using the same method as for whollyowned tangible assets.\n\nThe recoverable amount of individual property items within the different CGUs or group of CGUs is determined every year, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, and more often if market conditions so dictate. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is determined by an independent surveyor. If the fair value less costs to sell is below the carrying amount, the value in use is determined. This value is calculated using the value-in-use method. If the value in use is also below the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised for the difference between the carrying amount and the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.\n\n| Estimated useful life of property and equipment (years)   | Estimated useful life of property and equipment (years)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                                 | 40                                                        |\n| Right-of-use assets                                       | 1-10                                                      |\n| Operating system software and IT                          | 3-5                                                       |\n| Communication equipment                                   | 5                                                         |\n| Safety equipment                                          | 15                                                        |\n| Alterations                                               | 10-15                                                     |\n| Furniture and fixtures                                    | 5-10                                                      |\n\nOperating system software expenses are capitalised if they are identifiable, if there is a likelihood that future economic benefits will flow to Van Lanschot Kempen and if costs can be measured reliably.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the acquired assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities, and the purchase price paid (excluding acquisition costs). Goodwill paid is included in the financial statements at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill paid is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. An impairment is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.\n\nOwing to the absence of a market for separate CGUs, we are unable to calculate a reliable fair value less costs for which each CGU or group of CGUs may be sold. The recoverable amount is therefore deemed to be equal to the value in use. The value in use is determined by discounting the future equity cash flows generated by each CGU or group of CGUs to their net present value using a cost of equity for each CGU or group of CGUs. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The impairment is first applied in full to the goodwill and then pro rata to the individual assets.\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, such as client relationships, brand names and application software, are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives.",

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same tax authority, concern the same type of tax, if it is permitted under law to offset these deferrals and if the deferrals are expected to be settled simultaneously.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised on the face of the statement of financial position if the valuation of an asset or liability temporarily differs from the valuation for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates prevailing on the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are assessed at every reporting date and derecognised to the extent necessary. This derecognition will be reversed if it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n\nChanges in the value of investments at fair value through other comprehensive income and movements in the value of derivatives forming part of a cash flow hedge are recognised in equity net of deferred tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities cease to be recognised when these movements in value are realised. Current tax is taken to the statement of income on realisation of the movement in value.\n\n## Other assets\n\nOther assets comprise interest, commission and other receivables, and are carried at the lower of cost or the recoverable amount. This recoverable amount is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the relevant variable costs to sell. The recoverable amount less the relevant variable costs to sell is based on the appraisal value as determined by an independent surveyor. Other assets are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Due to banks\n\nAmounts due to banks are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Public and private sector liabilities\n\nPublic and private sector liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise financial instruments which management believes should be recognised at fair value through profit or loss based on one of the following reasons:\n\n- -Designation eliminates or significantly reduces inconsistencies in measurement and recognition which would otherwise arise as a result of liabilities being valued or income and expenses being recognised under different accounting policies; or\n- -The contract in which the financial instrument is included contains one or more embedded derivatives and the entire contract is recognised at fair value through profit or loss. This is only permitted if the embedded derivative has significant influence on the contractually agreed cash flows.\n\nThe valuation takes account of our own credit risk. Own credit risk is recognised in equity under the line item Other reserves. See also Note 21, Equity. The remaining amount of change in the fair value is recognised in Result on financial transactions.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities from trading activities. These are transactions for own account whereby the aim is to repurchase these instruments in the short term. These instruments are stated at fair value, with movements in value recognised in the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. This line item comprises short positions on the trading portfolio in both equity instruments and debt instruments. Recognition is from the date on which the contract is concluded.\n\n## Issued debt securities\n\nIssued debt securities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, issued debt securities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Repurchase of our own debt securities is offset in the consolidated financial statements against the liability; the difference between the cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is included in the statement of financial position if we have an obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are discounted if the time value of money for the liability has a material effect. The most material types of provisions are the provision for pensions, provisions for long-service benefits and restructuring provisions.\n\n## Provision for pensions\n\nWe operate defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Under defined contribution plans, contributions to pension providers are taken to the statement of income as staff costs. We have no further payment obligations with respect to defined contribution plans once the contributions have been paid.\n\nA defined benefit plan is a pension plan which defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. Factors such as age, years of service and salary are taken into account when determining the amounts to be paid. The provision for defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets.",

        "page_content": "Differences between the expected and actual return on plan assets, actuarial gains and losses and changes in the effect of the asset ceiling are recognised directly in equity; net interest is recognised under Other interest expense in the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions for long-service benefits\n\nEmployees receive a bonus to mark a long-service anniversary of 25 and 40 years. The obligation is calculated on an actuarial basis.\n\n## Restructuring provision\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised only if the recognition criteria are met. We have a constructive obligation if we have a detailed formal restructuring plan identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, the principal locations affected, the number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the expenditure to be undertaken and a suitable timeframe. Employees are also notified of the main features of the plan.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nLease liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as part of Other liabilities. Interest payments and amortisation in the year are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and disclosed within the statement of income.\n\nLease liabilities consist of interest and amortisation payments and are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Subordinated loans\n\nSubordinated loans are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost. Purchases of our own subordinated loans are offset against the liability in the consolidated financial statements; the difference between cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Equity\n\nDirect costs of new share issues are deducted from equity, taking account of taxes.\n\nIf we purchase treasury shares, the purchase price, including direct transaction costs after tax, is deducted from equity. Treasury shares that we purchase do not qualify for profit or dividend and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position\n\nThis includes obligations that represent a potential credit risk and where it is either not probable that it will lead to an outflow of resources or that a reliable estimate can be made. For the other obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position, see 'Commitments' in the supplementary notes.\n\n## Contingent assets and liabilities and irrevocable commitments\n\nContingent liabilities are carried at the contract value and relate in particular to guarantees and irrevocable letters of credit. This item consists of unused overdraft facilities, sale and repurchase commitments, irrevocable payment commitments for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and all other obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could give rise to loans.\n\n## Statement of income\n\n## General\n\nRevenue is recognised when it is likely that the economic benefits will flow to Van Lanschot Kempen and the revenue can be measured reliably. Costs are allocated as far as possible to the period in which the services were rendered or to the relevant proceeds.\n\n## Net interest income\n\nThis item consists of income earned on lending and costs of borrowing, derivatives, related commission, and other income/expense similar to interest. The amortisation of remaining value adjustments on mortgage portfolios of fair value hedges which expired in the past is presented under Interest income.\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recognised in the statement of income on an accrual basis, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash flows over the life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period when appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, we take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example early repayment) but not future losses due to uncollectible amounts.\n\nNegative interest paid is recognised under Interest income, and negative interest received is recognised under Interest expense.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\nAll dividends received from investments in equity instruments are recognised directly in the statement of income under Other income from securities and associates when they are made payable.\n\nOur share in the results of equity-valued associates is recognised under Income from securities and associates using the equity method. Dividends received are deducted from the carrying amount of the equity-valued associate. Due to the fact that these investments in associates using the equity method are part of our investment strategy, we present income from these as part of our operating activities.\n\n## Net commission income\n\nThis item comprises the income, other than income similar to interest, earned on wealth management services provided to third parties. It also includes fees charged to managed investment funds. Commission paid to third parties is accounted for as commission expense.",

        "page_content": "We receive commission for the wide range of services we provide to clients. This can be divided into commission on a transaction basis and periodic commission charged to the client during the year.\n\n## Commission on a transaction basis\n\nCommission income on a transaction basis is recognised in the periods in which we provide the services. Transaction commission for which we only provide a service on the transaction date (e.g. commission on buying and selling shares) is taken directly to the statement of income. Transaction commission for which we have to provide a service in the future (e.g. commission on structured products) forms part of the amortised cost and is recognised in the statement of income over the expected term of the instrument.\n\n## Periodic commission\n\nPeriodic commission (e.g. management fees) is recognised in the statement of income in the period in which the services are provided.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\nResult on securities trading includes realised and unrealised value differences on gains and losses on financial instruments relating to the securities trading portfolio. Exchange and price gains and losses on trading in other financial instruments are recognised under Result on foreign currency trading. Gains and losses due to ineffectiveness in hedge accounting are recognised under Unrealised gains/ losses on derivatives under hedge accounting. When financial assets at fair value through OCI are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified to Realised gains or losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Result on economic hedges includes realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivatives that are not included in a hedge accounting model. Result on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss comprises unrealised value differences and interest expenses on financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income comprises income from categories not listed above, for example income resulting from the consolidation of non-banking subsidiaries.\n\n## Staff costs\n\nStaff costs comprise wages and salaries, pension and early retirement costs, other social security costs and other staff costs such as remuneration in the form of share-based employee benefits.\n\n## Partnership plan\n\nThe partnership is a participation plan that will allow key senior staff to contribute to and participate in the success of Van Lanschot Kempen. Its purpose is to anchor leadership more broadly in our organisation, to further encourage ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, and to create more long-term alignment with our shareholders and clients. Partners' contributions remain in the partnership (FGR) during their full tenure as a partner. Partners receive a share-based discount of 18.5% and are subject to a lock-up period of five years.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nEmployees may be eligible to receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which the equity instruments are granted. The fair value is determined based on the share price on the grant date, taking into account the discounted value of expected dividends over the vesting period. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, in the period in which the employee's performance criteria are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award (the vesting date).\n\n## Partnership investment incentive\n\nThe purpose of the partnership investment incentive is to enhance the return perspective of the contributions with respect to which it is awarded. If awarded, a partnership investment incentive will apply with respect to the contributions made in the relevant contribution round for five financial years and will be calculated at the end of each of those five financial years in accordance with the partnership investment incentive formula.\n\nThe partnership investment incentive will be paid to the partners in two components: 70% in Van Lanschot Kempen shares and 30% in cash.\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses comprise IT expenses, costs of marketing and communication, accommodation expenses, office expenses and other administrative expenses.\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nDepreciation and amortisation costs are determined on the basis of estimated useful life and charged to the statement of income.\n\n## Impairments\n\nThis item comprises the balance of the required impairments and reversals of such impairments, including those on financial instruments, on investments in associates using the equity method, on goodwill and intangible assets, and on property and equipment.\n\n## Income tax\n\nTax on operating profit is recognised in the statement of income in accordance with applicable tax law in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax effects of any losses incurred in certain jurisdictions are recognised as assets when it is probable that sufficient future profits will be available in the relevant jurisdiction against which these losses can be offset.\n\n## Earnings per ordinary share\n\nEarnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for possible dilution as a result of, for example, outstanding option rights.",

It distinguishes between cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities include net changes in loans and advances, deposits from/with banks, and public and private sector liabilities. Investing activities include acquisition, redemption and sales of debt instruments, equity investments, associates using the equity method, property and equipment, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Financing activities include issues and repayments of share plans, debt instruments and issued debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents comprise, at face value, all cash in hand, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks. Investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents are excluded from the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Segment information\n\nThe different operating segments form the basis for our primary segmentation. An operating segment is a business unit that can earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by management or the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Additional information is reported geographically based on where the business activities are located. Intra-segment transactions are conducted on commercial terms and market conditions (at arm's length).",

Risk management supports the front office, clients and other stakeholders in ensuring that the risks taken by Van Lanschot Kempen are controlled and comply with our risk appetite and legal requirements. This section describes our risk appetite, the organisational and governance arrangements that are in place regarding risk management, and the three lines of defence principle. After describing these general arrangements, the section continues with credit risk, market risk, operational risk, settlement risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, securitisation risk, climate change risk, financial reporting risk and assets at fair value. An overview of compliance risks is also provided.\n\n## 1.1  Risk appetite\n\nSolid capital and liquidity ratios are essential prerequisites for a successful proposition to our clients and the financial stability of Van Lanschot Kempen in general. This is reflected in our risk appetite statement. We aim to have a simple and transparent balance sheet.\n\nWe have a robust risk appetite framework in place. Every year, the Management Board assesses and updates the risk appetite statement, which translates our risk appetite into strategic limits. The risk appetite statement is then submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. Quarterly risk appetite reports serve as important discussion documents for the continuous review of our risk profile.\n\n## 1.2  Organisation of risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe purpose of our risk management framework is to identify and analyse risks at an early stage, as well as to mitigate and monitor those risks. Adequate internal control procedures and reporting systems, including the application of standards and limits, are key elements of our risk management framework.\n\nThe organisation of our risk management framework is based on the three lines of defence principle. Day-to-day responsibility for risk control lies with the front office and/or operational departments (the first line of defence), including internal control activities and Finance, Reporting & Control.\n\nCompliance and Risk Management form the second line of defence for financial and non-financial risks. These departments are responsible for initiating risk policies and the supervision of risk controls within Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nInternal Audit forms the third line of defence and is responsible for performing independent audits on the risk management framework and activities of the first and second line. The department reports to the Chair of the Management Board. This set-up creates a clear, balanced and appropriate division of tasks, powers and responsibilities, and ensures independent and effective operation of the risk management function.\n\nRisk Management and Asset & Liability Management (ALM) stand at the core of capital management. We actively manage our capital base to cover risks inherent to our business and meet the capital adequacy requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). The adequacy of our capital is monitored by using the rules and ratios established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as transposed into EU law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). This legal framework also forms the basis for supervision by DNB through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Over the reporting period, we fully complied with all externally imposed capital requirements. Both external and internal capital adequacy targets are taken into account, and the central focus is on safeguarding our financial solidity and stability. Each year, a capital and funding plan is prepared for capital management purposes.\n\n## Table 1.2 Risk, capital management and compliance framework\n\nSupervision\n\n\u00a7 1.2.1\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n- - Risk and Compliance Committee\n- - Audit Committee\n\n## Risk and capital management\n\n\u00a7 1.2.2\n\n## Management Board\n\n- - Group Risk Committee\n- - Credit Risk Committee\n- - Market Risk Committee\n- - Asset & Liability Committee\n- - Sustainability Board\n- - Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n- - Credit Committee\n- - Product Approval & Review Committee\n\n## Implementation and review\n\n\u00a7 1.2.3\n\nRisk\n\nManagement and\n\nAsset & Liability\n\nManagement\n\nFinance, Reporting & Control\n\nCompliance\n\nInternal Audit\n\n## Execution\n\n\u00a7 1.2.4\n\nClient\n\nManagement & Origination\n\nInvestment Strategies &\n\nSolutions\n\nTreasury\n\nCredit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.1 Supervision\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees the risks and capital requirements in relation to the group's operations and portfolio composition. It has set up two committees specifically for this purpose. In the first half of 2022, compliance topics were discussed in the Audit Committee. After the change from a Chief Financial Officer/Chief Risk Officer (CFRO) to a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) from 1 September 2022, compliance topics were discussed in the Risk and Compliance Committee.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee focuses on all identified risks in the group's business activities, as well as the risk management framework. Compliance risks and matters regarding duty of care are also discussed in this committee. The Committee also prepares decision-making by the Supervisory Board on risk matters.\n\nThe Audit Committee is tasked with advising the Supervisory Board on financial reporting, internal and external audits.\n\n## 1.2.2 Risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for developing and executing Van Lanschot Kempen's strategy. This includes our capital and funding plan, which is based on a number of risk, capital management and compliance policies.\n\nThe primary objective of our capital management is to ensure that we comply with external and internal capital requirements in order to support our businesses and to create value for our stakeholders. We manage our capital structure by taking into account changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our activities. To maintain and/or manage our capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. These adjustments are under constant review by the Management Board. Lastly, requests or demands by our supervisors DNB and/or ECB can also influence capital management.\n\nThe Management Board also bears responsibility for ensuring the proper operation of the processes that safeguard the group's liquidity and capital position. In addition, it is required to provide information to the Supervisory Board, which in turn assesses the risk appetite of the group. To ensure the various risk types are managed properly, the Management Board has set up the following risk and compliance committees:\n\n## Group Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Risk Committee, which includes all members of the Management Board and the heads of Risk Management and Compliance, discusses group-wide risk management themes. Chaired by the CRO, this committee brings together, discusses and monitors the various risk types on an integrated level. The committee is involved in setting the annual risk appetite statement and discusses the risk appetite report and emerging trends in the risk profile. Other areas covered include recovery and resolution planning.\n\n## Credit Risk Committee\n\nThe Credit Risk Committee sets and adjusts the group's overall credit risk policy and translates this into acceptance and portfolio management policies. In executing its tasks, the committee bears in mind our strategic objectives and the guiding principles informing the risk appetite statement.\n\nThe CRO chairs this committee; other members represent Risk Management, Private Clients, and Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery.\n\n## Market Risk Committee\n\nThis committee focuses on all market risks within Van Lanschot Kempen and is chaired by the CRO. Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates (excluding interest rate risk in the banking book), exchange rates and equity prices. It also considers variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility and correlations, which also influence the value of certain financial instruments. Market risks at Investment Banking Clients arise from securities trading to facilitate our clients (mainly equities and equity derivatives). Van Lanschot Kempen is exposed to a certain amount of market risk (mainly foreign exchange and structured products activities) through its treasury activities. Our foreign exchange risk is limited, as the majority of transactions and positions in the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Van Lanschot Kempen is also exposed to market risk as a result of management book investments.\n\n## Asset & Liability Committee\n\nThe Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing risks that result from mismatches between assets and liabilities (interest rate and liquidity risks), as well as the capital position of the bank. ALCO's main tasks are:\n\n- -Overseeing the asset and liability management process;\n- -Setting policies on interest rate risk in the banking book 1 , liquidity and funding risk, funds transfer pricing and capitalisation; 1\n- -Monitoring the development of the balance sheet and balance-sheet projections.\n\nALCO convenes once a month and is chaired by the CFO. ALCO's members also comprise:\n\n- -The Chair of the Management Board;\n- -The CRO;\n- -The Management Board member responsible for Client Management & Origination;\n- -ALM, Treasury, Risk Management and Finance, Reporting & Control directors.\n\n## Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n\nThe Compliance & Operational Risk Committee is responsible for the implementation and execution of our compliance and operational risk management policies. The committee assesses compliance and operational risks, and ensures remedial actions are taken where required. The committee also challenges and approves the annual plans of the NonFinancial Risk Management and Compliance departments. It is chaired by the CRO. Among other matters, the root causes of major operational risk incidents are discussed in this committee.\n\nRisk Management takes the lead in the committees described above, with the exception of the Compliance & Operational Risk Committee, where both Compliance and Risk Management are in charge, and ALCO, where Asset & Liability Management is in charge. We also have a number of committees that form part of the first line of defence and that cover specific risk-related topics, such as the Credit Committee and Client Management & Origination's Product Approval & Review  Committee.",

In addition, Compliance carries out the implementation, monitoring and/or review of compliance policies.\n\n## Risk Management is responsible for:\n\n- -Second-line monitoring and management of all risks relating to the statement of financial position at group level, including modelling, measuring, managing and reporting on our credit, market, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks;\n- -Business continuity management;\n- -Information security;\n- -The risk appetite process;\n- -Preparing, developing and maintaining policy documents;\n- -Issuing daily market risk reports;\n- -Proactively and reactively providing advice on managing risks;\n- -Raising risk awareness among staff in order to improve their ability to strike a sound balance between risk and return.\n\nRisk Management and ALM are responsible for:\n\n- -Preparing ICAAP and ILAAP documentation as well as the recovery plan.\n\nFinance, Reporting & Control is responsible for the financial accounting and business control function. Through its various reports, Finance, Reporting & Control fulfils an important role in challenging the businesses. These reports include monthly management reports and cost control reports, and are used to monitor the progress of business plans.\n\nCompliance has both an advisory and a monitoring role with respect to compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for Van Lanschot Kempen. As compliance risks are part of Van Lanschot Kempen's overall risk governance, Compliance as an independent function is involved in and supports the management of compliance risks by identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting on such risks.\n\nCompliance risks include risks such as personal data integrity, financial crime, business conduct and client protection risks.\n\nInternal Audit periodically reviews the design and effectiveness of the risk organisation and the execution of our risk, capital management and compliance policies in accordance with their annual audit plan. The applicable policies form the starting point for the independent review by Internal Audit. Processes, infrastructure, organisation and systems are audited based on these policies in order to determine whether the organisation adequately executes its risk, capital management and compliance policies.\n\n## 1.2.4  Execution of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nCMO and Investment Strategies & Solutions (ISS) prepare their own business plans. On the basis of these plans, current and future risks are assessed, including expected capital and liquidity requirements. These assessments serve as input for the various risk committees.\n\n## 1.3 Capital requirements\n\nThe standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and translated into law (CRR and CRD, Wft), apply to all Dutch banks. The Basel framework consists of three pillars:\n\n- -Pillar 1 stipulates capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk.\n- -Pillar 2 requires banks to have internal processes for risk management and to calculate the capital requirements needed to address all risks that are not included in Pillar 1. The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) is also part of Pillar 2.\n- -Pillar 3 sets out requirements for disclosure of information about the institution's risk profile to external stakeholders.\n\nOur website provides Pillar 3 disclosures (unaudited) and a detailed breakdown of our portfolio of loans to companies and institutions (unaudited). Meanwhile our remuneration policy is explained both in a remuneration section and a Pillar 3 disclosure (unaudited), both also on our website.\n\n## 1.4 Individual risks\n\nThe following sections detail the individual risk types to which we are exposed. They therefore cover a combination of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements. The risk types covered are:\n\n- -Strategic risk (Section 2);\n- -Credit risk (Section 3);\n- -Market risk (Section 4);\n- -Operational risk (Section 5);\n- -Settlement risk (Section 6);\n- -CVA risk (Section 7);\n- -Interest rate risk (Section 8);\n- -Liquidity risk (Section 9);\n- -Securitisation risk (Section 10);\n- -Climate change and sustainability risks (Section 11);\n- -Compliance risk (Section 12);\n- -Financial reporting risk (Section 13).\n\n## 2. Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk can be defined as the threat to our results or equity arising from a failure to respond (adequately) to changes in external factors or from incorrect strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities. Strategic risk is not inherently undesirable, since there can also be an upside to taking these risks. We take a forwardlooking approach to strategic risk, keep a close eye on external developments and set our strategic priorities accordingly. Our strategy puts a strong focus on advanced data analytics among other areas. Existing risk management practices and measures are assessed regularly to ensure that possible new risks that may arise from changes in strategic direction or in the business environment are addressed adequately.\n\n## 3. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty or client is no longer able to fulfil its obligations. Our credit risk policies focus on the counterparty risks associated with lending to private clients and SMEs. Strict selection criteria for new clients and active credit management for existing clients are applied to safeguard the quality of the loan portfolio. Our lending activities are required to be in line with stated objectives, and individual assessments are used to ascertain this.",

        "page_content": "As well as from lending activities, credit risk also arises from:\n\n- -Investment activities;\n- -International payment transactions and cash management;\n- -FX and hedging activities;\n- -Settlement risk.\n\nOur investment activities relate to the management of our liquidity buffer and equity investments. For the liquidity buffer, a limit framework is in place to manage and monitor associated credit risks.\n\nCounterparty credit risk with respect to financial institutions arises from international payment transactions, cash management, FX and hedging activities. Some of these activities also involve settlement risk. For derivatives transactions, counterparty credit risk is mitigated by daily margining.\n\nWe apply a strict policy when determining and monitoring country and counterparty (financial institutions) limits. The country limits serve as a cross limit for financial institutions, meaning that the counterparty risks in respect of financial institutions in one country are limited by the relevant country limit, as the country limit is usually lower than the aggregate of the individual counterparty limits.\n\n## 3.1 Loans and advances\n\n## 3.1.1  Credit acceptance\n\nOur loan approval policy focuses on maintaining a highquality loan portfolio. The authority to approve loans and loan reviews is delegated to a limited number of teams, mainly our Credit Approval team.\n\nThe authority to approve large loans rests with the Credit Committee, which comprises representatives of the relevant divisions as well as members of the Management Board.\n\nThe mid- and back-office for nearly all residential mortgage loans is carried out by a third party. A service level agreement (SLA) is in place to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk.\n\nThe acceptance process is not outsourced, with the exception of our white label loans - residential mortgages offered by a third party. The acceptance and management of credit risks has been outsourced to this third party, within our strict guidelines and in accordance with prevailing legal requirements.\n\nThese activities are closely monitored using detailed data from the mortgage portfolio. This makes it possible, for example, to recognise any arrears. We also review random samples of mortgage loans. An SLA is in place to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk.\n\nLimits on financial institutions and countries are determined using a number of hard criteria such as the external rating, BIS ratios, capital ratios, country of origin and gross domestic product (for countries). Limits can also be adjusted and withdrawn on a daily basis.\n\nNew loan requests are assessed to determine if they are in line with our strategy and we adopt a conservative approach to granting them.\n\nThe credit risk concentration mainly lies within our Private Clients segment in the Netherlands, as our office network in the Netherlands is bigger than in the other countries in which we are active in extending credit.\n\n## 3.1.2  Credit management - policy and processes\n\nTo achieve and attain a high-quality loan portfolio, strict credit management is required. Credit management is carried out at both individual loan and portfolio level. At the individual loan level, explicit attention is devoted to the management of unauthorised overdrafts and accounts past due. Loans with an elevated risk profile are subjected to a risk check. In addition, a portion of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and the credit risk of individual clients is scrutinised as part of this review. The frequency of reviews varies according to the individual borrower's risk profile, but they take place at least annually. In addition to financial analyses, reviews take account of future developments in a client's situation (partly in the light of relevant macroeconomic trends).\n\nA deterioration in a client's risk profile may lead to closer supervision, an adjusted rating, corrective measures (such as requiring additional collateral or increasing the frequency of financial reporting), involvement of the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department or a combination of these measures. It may also lead to a stage transfer under IFRS 9  - see Section 3.8.\n\nAt portfolio level, credit risks are monitored on a monthly basis. In addition, several early warning indicators are used to draw up a watch list, which is discussed bi-monthly. A detailed credit risk report and any relevant developments or expected developments are discussed in the Credit Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. Any negative trend identified in the risk profile of a particular client segment, sector or loan type, can lead to the adjustment of the relevant lending policy. Trends in sectors where there is a concentration risk are monitored particularly closely.\n\nIf the review, risk check, payment arrears or external signals point to an increased risk of discontinuity, the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department is involved in the credit management process. An estimate is made of the probability of continuity. Depending on the seriousness and magnitude of the problem, either monitoring or intensive supervision is applied. If there are objective indicators of impairment the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department draws up an impairment proposal. The Impairment Committee determines the impairment for the whole credit portfolio on a quarterly basis.\n\nActive management of past due loans enables potential problem loans to be identified at an early stage. If an individual assessment identifies an increased risk, the Credit Risk, Credit Restructuring & Recovery department will supervise the client. Increased credit risk occurs in situations including the following:\n\n- -If clients fail to meet their payment obligations;\n- -If clients report difficulties in meeting future payments, e.g. because of a divorce, unemployment etc.;\n- -In the event of a default (see Section 3.1.3);\n- -For business clients, in the event of a significant decrease in turnover, breach of one or more covenants, a debt service coverage ratio < 1, etc.",

        "page_content": "The primary goal of the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department is to migrate clients back to accounts with regular status (i.e. not under the supervision of Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery) by reducing their credit risk. The aim is to do this in accordance with the loan agreements made with these clients, but forbearance measures are applied if necessary. For more information on forborne exposures, see Section 3.2.\n\n## 3.1.3  Credit risk measurement\n\nWe have developed internal models for measuring and monitoring credit risk for the majority of the loan portfolio. Some of these internal models are also used to determine the required capital that has to be set aside for absorbing unexpected credit losses. For this reason, the models, the use of these models and the model governance have to adhere to strict requirements set out in the CRR.\n\nThe CRR distinguishes three approaches for determining the required capital for credit risk: the standardised approach (SA), the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach. We use SA and A-IRB for our loan portfolios.\n\nThe standardised approach prescribes a set of rules for determining the required capital based on various characteristics such as client type, loan type, collateral type, and external rating. Under A-IRB, banks are allowed to use own estimates for PD, EAD and LGD. The PD is defined as the likelihood that a client will default within one year, the EAD is defined as the bank's expected exposure at the time a client defaults, and the LGD is the expected loss percentage in the event that a client defaults. As a result, A-IRB is more risksensitive than SA.\n\nWe have approval from DNB to determine and report the required regulatory capital for our residential mortgage exposures portfolio using the A-IRB approach. For these models, we have a model governance framework in place. As part of this, the performance of the models is periodically monitored, and these models are also periodically validated against independent models.\n\nThe PD model is mostly based on behavioural aspects of the client and the LGD models on the underlying collateral. For the capital calculations a so-called downturn LGD is applied, i.e. the expected loss at default during an economic downturn. Estimation of the EAD is based on the limit and credit utilisation.\n\nThe SA method has been used for capital calculations in all our other retail and non-retail portfolios.\n\n## IRB equity portfolio\n\nThe IRB equity portfolio includes our positions in equities in the investment portfolio, subordinated receivables, noncontrolling interests and shareholdings which appear on Van Lanschot Kempen's company statement of financial position. We use the simple risk-weighted method to calculate the risk-weighted assets for positions in shares.\n\nIn this method, a specific risk weighting (190%, 290% or 370%) is assigned to each position, based on a number of characteristics. A risk weighting of 250% is applied for significant investments in financial institutions that are not deducted from equity because they fall below the regulatory threshold. Positions taken in shares and subordinated loans\n\nof wholly owned subsidiaries are excluded from IRB. These are reported using the SA method.\n\n## Other loans and advances\n\nThe risk-weighted assets of other portfolios, such as the debt securities in our investment portfolio managed by the Treasury department (i.e. excluding retail, non-retail and equity), are calculated on the basis of the SA method.\n\n## Definition of default and credit-impaired assets\n\nOur definition of default is informed by EBA guidelines. Most notably, the materiality threshold complies with the uniform European standard. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows:\n\n- -A breach of contract such as a more than 90 days past due event with a materiality of more than \u20ac100 and more than 1% of total credit obligation (retail exposures) or more than \u20ac500 and more than 1% of total credit obligation for non-retail exposures;\n- -Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower and an inability to meet future payments;\n- -Concession(s) granted to the borrower that the lender would not otherwise consider, relating to the borrower's financial difficulties (forbearance);\n- -A growing likelihood that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial restructuring;\n- -The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial market difficulties;\n- -The purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit loss.\n\nIt may not always be possible to identify a single discrete event; instead the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become impaired. All impaired assets are also classified as defaulted by Van Lanschot Kempen under CRR rules. Van Lanschot Kempen has implemented one definition that serves for all its different purposes.\n\n## 3.2 Forborne exposures\n\nA loan is considered forborne if the borrower is unable to meet their contractual obligations towards the bank and the bank decides to make a concession to the client by modifying the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. The objective of this modification is to enable the borrower to meet the renewed obligations, and it would not have been offered if those circumstances had not arisen. Forbearance actions may include one or more of the following measures:\n\n- -Amendment of the original terms and conditions of the loan agreement that the client cannot meet due to financial difficulties, with a view to restoring the client's payment capacity;\n- -Full or partial refinancing of a forborne exposure.\n\nThe purpose of the measures taken in forbearance situations is to maximise the chance of restoring the borrower's payment capacity and to minimise the risk of losses due to having to write off all or part of the loan. Measures must offer the client an appropriate and sustainable solution, enabling them to comply with the original obligations arising from the credit agreement in due course.\n\nApplying forbearance measures is exclusively reserved for the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department, which pursues a policy based on general principles and translates this to the specific situation of the individual client. Given the nature of these loans, the Credit",

        "page_content": "Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department carries out intensive credit management. Before any new arrangements are agreed, a detailed analysis is made of the client, their financial situation and the likelihood of income recovery. The outcome of this analysis may have consequences for the client's review frequency and the size of any loan loss provision to be made. If the client qualifies for appropriate forbearance measures, a proposal will be drawn up and submitted to the competent assessor(s) for approval. If a forbearance measure is granted, the client is classified as a non-performing exposure.\n\nIn practice, forbearance measures do not always have the desired effect - i.e. the recovery of the client's payment capacity or an end to the process of declining payment capacity. This may, for example, be the result of a further deterioration in the client's financial circumstances or the failure of those circumstances to improve as expected. Such cases are reanalysed and a strategy is redefined. However, the principle is explicitly maintained that the forbearance measure must be appropriate, sustainable and effective. Any new arrangements agreed with the borrower must also meet these strict criteria.\n\nA forbearance situation ends when the non-performing status has no longer been applied to the loan for a probation period of two years. The non-performing status must last a minimum of one year starting from the last forbearance\n\nmeasure. Moreover, the client must have made significant and regular payments of interest and/or principal during at least half of the probation period. During the two-year probation period, no payments by the borrower may be in arrears for more than 30 days. If this condition is not met, the probation period will start again from the date the client is no longer in arrears for more than 30 days.\n\nThe recording and monitoring of loans which are subject to forbearance is carried out by the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department. Each quarter, and where appropriate more frequently for specific loans, an individual assessment is carried out of forborne exposures which are in default, in relation to any provision made. In addition to this quarterly assessment (as part of the provisioning process), these loans are subject to extensive credit risk management, the intensity and frequency of which will as far as possible match the specific circumstances of the loan.\n\nTables 3.2.A through 3.2.C show the total volume of forborne exposures. We apply several types of forbearance measures (see Table 3.2.A).\n\nFollowing the decision to apply such a measure, a loan remains under the supervision of the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department until the forbearance situation has ended.\n\nTables 3.2.B and 3.2.C provide an insight into the underlying collateral of forborne loans. This breakdown is based on the collateral used under Basel regulations, with the exception of commercial real estate, for which collateral is based on\n\n| Table 3.2.A Types of forborne exposure (\u20ac1,000)   | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total                                             | 27,667       | 34,877       |\n| Capitalisation of arrears/interest                | 430          | -            |\n| Refinancing or new loan                           | 2,954        | 7,299        |\n| Interest payment only                             | 488          | -            |\n| Reduction of repayments                           | 9,320        | 23,717       |\n| Deferred payment of financing costs               | 417          | -            |\n| Extension of loan term                            | 11,593       | 1,265        |\n| Reduction in interest rate                        | 2,466        | 2,596        |\n\nmarket values.

Mortgage loans also include Kempen Dutch Inflation Fund, a fund that invests in leasehold contracts primarily in connection with Dutch residential real estate to create an investment in long-term inflation-linked cash flows.\n\n| Table 3.3 Breakdown of loan portfolio by entity excluding impairments (\u20ac1,000)   | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                  | Limit        | Utilisation  | Limit        | Utilisation  |\n| Total                                                                            | 9,788,935    | 9,403,957    | 9,382,558    | 8,925,054    |\n| Van Lanschot Kempen                                                              | 9,261,440    | 8,973,764    | 8,832,356    | 8,490,584    |\n| Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management                                        | 163,062      | 163,062      | 164,431      | 164,431      |\n| Other                                                                            | 364,433      | 267,131      | 385,771      | 270,039      |\n\n## 3.4 Collateral\n\nIn general, collateral can be used for all current and future amounts owed by a debtor.

The total amount of unsecured loans is small.\n\nThe loan-to-value (LTV) of our mortgage loans is based on indexed foreclosure values, in line with generally accepted standards for LTV determination. The average LTV at yearend 2022 was 63% (2021: 62%).\n\n## 3.5  Concentration within the loan portfolio\n\nAbout 83% (2021: 85%) of our loan portfolio consists of loans to private clients. For the credit risk in this portfolio, see Section 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit loss. We aim for a diversified loan portfolio, reflecting our risk appetite. We have set limits for concentrations in individual sectors.\n\n## 3.5.1  Individual loan concentrations\n\nThe ten largest loans to individual clients other than financial institutions totalled \u20ac227 million at year-end 2022, compared with a total loan portfolio of \u20ac8.1 billion (2021: \u20ac183 million; total loan portfolio \u20ac7.7 billion). In this calculation, Lombard loans secured by non-single stock are excluded. 3\n\n## 3.5.2 Geographical concentrations\n\nIn line with our strategy, the majority of lending takes place in the Netherlands and Belgium. The geographical breakdown is based on client locations.\n\n|             | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   |\n|-------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total       | 9,363,958    | 8,875,601    |\n| Netherlands | 8,654,618    | 8,276,319    |\n| Belgium     | 472,882      | 340,186      |\n| Other       | 236,459      | 259,096      |\n\n## 3.6 Encumbered and unencumbered assets\n\nCertain items in the statement of financial position are classified as encumbered. Tables 3.6.A and 3.6.B provide insight into the financial assets treated as encumbered. These tables have been drawn up on the basis of carrying value.\n\n## Encumbered assets\n\n## Pledged as collateral:\n\n- -Cash pledged to a counterparty bank or central clearing party as security for obligations stemming from derivatives (CSA contracts);\n- -Investments in debt instruments pledged to DNB or counterparty banks in the context of repo transactions or for securities and derivatives clearing purposes;\n\n## Other:\n\n- -Statutory reserve deposits with central banks;\n- -Reserve accounts of the covered bond entities to which we have no access.\n\n## Unencumbered assets\n\n## Eligible as collateral:\n\n- -Investments in debt instruments which appear on the ECB eligible list of marketable assets but are not classified as encumbered at the reporting date;\n- -Mortgage loans and advances on underlying debt instruments which are held by us and which appear on the ECB eligible list of marketable assets but are not classified as encumbered at the reporting date.\n- -Mortgage loans and receivables that act as a guarantee for debt instruments which have been been placed with institutional investors in the form of covered bonds or have been pledged as collateral to DNB, e.g. for transaction settlements.",

Loss allowance for expected credit loss\n\nUnder the IFRS 9 standard, we recognise a loss allowance for ECL on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there is no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit loss (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has\n\noccurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime ECL (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\n## 3.8.1. Expected loss measurement\n\nWe measure expected credit losses by using a sophisticated approach and an alternative approach. For the sophisticated approach we use models to calculate the ECL, governed by a model governance framework. Under this framework, the performance of the models is periodically monitored, and",

        "page_content": "these models are also periodically validated. The IFRS 9 models were externally validated in 2021 and are also subject to quarterly performance monitoring. If models are performing outside the agreed threshold, recalibration or ultimately redevelopment will follow. In recent years, several recalibrations have been carried out; no redevelopment has yet been necessary.\n\nIn both approaches, ECL reflects an unbiased probabilityweighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and verifiable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Both approaches calculate a 12-month and a lifetime ECL for the exposures of all three stages.\n\nAfter the risk stage determination in the stage calculation, the relevant ECL is assigned:\n\n- -12-month ECL for Stage 1;\n- -Lifetime ECL for Stage 2 and Stage 3.\n\nThe key elements of the ECL calculation are the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), cure rate (CR), and loss given non-cure (LGN). LGN is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default without cure occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would\n\n## Model\n\n## Macroeconomic variables\n\nPD calibration\n\n- - Gross domestic product (GDP)\n\nCure rate\n\n- - Total investments (TI)\n\nLGN\n\n- - Gross domestic product (GDP)\n- - Residential real estate price (RREP)\n\n## 3.8.2. Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nTo determine the deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument since initial recognition, we compare the risk of default at the reporting date with the risk of default on initial recognition.\n\nTo calculate the lifetime probability of default (LPD) at origination and the LPD at reporting date, we use four PD models: private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporates, and commercial real estate. If the increase in LPD exceeds the designated threshold, the exposure is transferred to Stage 2 and the lifetime ECL is calculated.\n\nexpect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral.\n\nIn addition to these four key elements, we incorporate forward-looking information for the sophisticated approach.\n\nWe identify macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL:\n\n- -A base-case scenario;\n- -An upside scenario;\n- -A downside scenario.\n\nThese scenarios are associated with different PDs, EADs and LGNs. In the process of building the PD, cure rate and LGN models for IFRS, we included several macroeconomic risk drivers in the long list of risk drivers. Those determined as best-performing during modelling were selected to be part of the model. The macroeconomic scenarios are generated based on inputs from CPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, DNB, ECB and Van Lanschot Kempen's economic experts. The reported ECL (12-month or lifetime, depending on the stage) is a weighted average of ECLs per macroeconomic scenario. The table below shows the macroeconomic variables used for the sophisticated approach. However, we believe our models do not fully incorporate the unique current economic environment. To address the uncertain economic environment, we have applied a management overlay (see Section 3.8.7).\n\nWe use the following thresholds for the different PD models:\n\n- - Private investments\n\n0.8\n\n- - Small and medium-sized enterprises\n\n0.9\n\n- - Corporates\n\n1.3\n\n- - Commercial real estate 0.9\n\nA backstop is applied and financial instruments that are materially overdrawn and more than 30 days past due are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2. If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, it is transferred to Stage 3.\n\n## Threshold\n\nAn exposure will be regarded as \"significantly deteriorated\" if the result of the following formula exceeds the limit:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Private consumption (PC)\n- - Residential real estate price (RREP)\n- - Government consumption (GC)\n- - Volume of exports (EXP)",

Financial instruments following the sophisticated approach\n\nFor the majority of financial instruments included in the line item Loans and advances to the public and private sectors, including mortgage loans, loans, current accounts, subordinated loans and financial guarantees and loan commitments, we apply a sophisticated approach to calculate expected credit loss (ECL). This approach uses an umbrella model that combines the following sub-models:\n\n- -Various models that provide the expected flow of exposures to the default state;\n- -A PD calibration model giving the flow from performing to default;\n- -A full prepayment model and amortisation model giving the outflow from the portfolio of an entire exposure due to prepayment or contract expiration;\n- -A migration model providing flows from performing rating classes to other performing rating classes;\n- -A cure rate model giving the flow from default to performing classes and the non-cure state;\n\n-\n\nVarious product-level models that give the expected\n\nexposure at the moment a client goes into default;\n\n- -An amortisation model showing the contractual payments during the lifetime of a product and the part of the exposure flowing out of the portfolio due to partial prepayments;\n- -An EAD model giving the exposure as a function of the limit or outstanding amount just before default;\n- -A product-level model evaluating the part of EAD that may be lost - the loss given loss (LGL) model;\n- -A discount factor to discount the loss from the moment of default to the moment of reporting.\n\n## 3.8.4. Financial instruments following the alternative approach\n\nWe apply an alternative approach for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, and loans and security-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG. The alternative approach comprises an investments model and a foreign loan model.\n\n## 3.8.5. Investments model\n\nThe investments model is applied to calculate the ECL for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, and debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial instruments all have a low risk profile. All such exposures are assigned to Stage 1 as long as their external rating is investment grade. We use a simplified model to calculate 12-month ECL, using publicly available data for PD and LGD based on external ratings. If financial assets are downgraded below investment grade, these assets will be sold.\n\n## 3.8.6. Foreign loans model\n\nFor the loans and securities-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG, we have developed a foreign loans model. These two portfolios fall outside the scope of the A-IRB models and no requirements on historical data have been set. The foreign loans model calculates ECL as the sum of future exposure discounted at the effective interest rate at recognition for non-revolving products and the current effective interest rate for revolving products.\n\n## 3.8.7. Management overlay\n\nAt the start of the Covid pandemic, it was unclear what the effects were going to be on our portfolio's credit risk. It was decided to introduce a management overlay to take into account the expected  effects of the pandemic on the creditworthiness of borrowers belonging to specific sectors most hit by the pandemic, i.e. clients in leisure and hospitality, and clients active in commercial real estate (excluding residential real estate). The overlay consisted of two adjustments applied to a selection of borrowers. The first adjustment was a downgrade in the PD bucket (reflecting the increased PD) of these sectors. The second adjustment was to transfer specific clients from Stage 1 to Stage 2.\n\nAs a result of the war in Ukraine that started in February 2022, we decided to introduce an add-on to the level of provisioning as of the first quarter of 2022 due to the direct and indirect impacts of this crisis on the economy. The overlay consisted of three adjustments applied to a selection of borrowers: a downgrade in PD bucket and subsequent shift to Stage 2 of clients in specific sectors (construction, manufacturing, transportation and farming) and a shift in the probability-weighted scenarios that are part of the IFRS 9 framework.\n\nHowever, three years after the outbreak of the pandemic that has affected some sectors more heavily, the economy and the financial sector have absorbed most of its consequences. Meanwhile, the war in Ukraine has had a major impact on energy and commodity prices and has driven up inflation. We have therefore decided that it is appropriate to move from sector-specific overlays to a more general overlay which applies to all loan portfolios and exposures included in the scope of our sophisticated approach IFRS 9 framework. We have focused on PD-specific adjustments, since we believe a more general overlay will materialise mostly in the probability of client default. The approach consists of three adjustments. First, probability-weighted scenarios have been adjusted from 25%-50%-25% for adverse, neutral and positive scenarios to 40%-50%-10%. Second, one of the PD model risk drivers, the amount of arrears, has changed from 12-month moving average to point-in-time to reflect recent arrears behaviour. And thirdly, it is reasonable to assume that discretionary income could be impacted and result in increased arrears. Also, borrowers subject to an interest rate reset could face significantly higher financing costs. Based on expert judgement, we shocked the PD to reflect this risk.\n\nThe total management overlay applied for individual clients and economic sectors resulted in a provision of \u20ac5.2 million (2021: \u20ac1.6 million).\n\nEven after incorporating this management overlay, the net impact on our credit portfolio was relatively limited. This is reflected in the relatively small increase in ECL.\n\n## 3.8.8. Loss allowances\n\nThe table below shows the ECL loss allowances and the corresponding book values, categorised by balance sheet line item and ECL by stage, as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022.",

Higher exposures in Stage 1 due to originated and purchased loans were offset by net transfers to Stages 2 and 3. Provisions in Stage 1  increased by \u20ac2.5 million. This was mainly caused by three effects. First, we applied a \u20ac1.0 million management overlay in Stage 1. Second, the macroeconomic outlook deteriorated, which also affected Stage 1 exposure. And third, newly originated residential mortgages have higher LTVs on average, resulting in somewhat higher ECLs. The coverage ratio increased from a very low level to 0.1%.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nStage 2 provisions rose from \u20ac3.5 million to \u20ac7.0 million in 2022, with the Stage 2 exposure adding \u20ac520 million. The increase in provisions was mainly caused  by the \u20ac4.0 million management overlay in Stage 2, an increase on 2021. This management overlay partly comprised a shock to all PDs, resulting in additional migration from Stage 1 to Stage 2.\n\nMost of these exposures concern mortgages. The coverage ratio slightly widened compared with 2021.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nThe baseline for Stage 3 provisions is determined by our Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department, with limited IFRS 9 model adjustments. In 2022, Stage 3 exposures and provisions fell significantly, to \u20ac26.9 million. This was due to a release of provisions on the resolution of some specific impaired exposures, fewer impaired exposures and limited new defaults. The total impaired exposure was down \u20ac47 million, while the coverage ratio slightly decreased compared with 2021.",

Credit quality\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen allocates each exposure to a credit risk grade based on a variety of data that are determined to be predictive of the risk of default. Credit risk grades are defined using qualitative (applying experienced credit judgement) and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.\n\nWe use internally developed rating pools for the line items Loans and advances to the public and private sectors and Financial guarantees and loan commitments.",

Macroeconomic variables\n\nWe incorporate forward-looking information for the sophisticated approach. We use macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL: a base-case scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. The weightings of the scenarios were 25% for both the positive and negative scenarios and 50% for the basecase scenario as at 31 December 2021.\n\nIn 2022, we adjusted the weightings to 10% for the positive scenario, 40% for the negative scenario and 50% for the base-case scenario, given growing uncertainty about the economic recovery due to the war in Ukraine and subsequent higher inflation. The table below shows the macroeconomic variables used for the sophisticated approach as at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2022.\n\n| Table 3.8.P Macroeconomic variables   | As at 31 December 2022

In addition to residential mortgage collateral and guarantees provided by governments and credit institutions, commercial real estate, financial collateral, receivables, stocks and inventories may serve as collateral. The majority of collateral is not directly linked to a specific financing arrangement.\n\nFor credit-impaired financial instruments, the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department determines the liquidation or recovery value of the available collateral, based on the most recent valuation reports and applying the applicable haircuts.\n\nThe table below shows the collateral for financial instruments considered credit-impaired.\n\n| Table 3.8.R Collateral for credit-impaired instruments as at  31 December 2022 (\u20ac1,000)   | Gross exposure   | Impairment   | Carrying amount Value of collateral   |         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Loans and advances to public and private sectors                                          | 109,221          | 26,925       | 82,305                                | 165,512 |\n| Financial guarantees and loan commitments                                                 | 3,258            | 10           | 3,248                                 | 6,033   |\n\nNo impairment is recognised for credit-impaired financial instruments if the collateral is sufficient to cover the outstanding obligation. The total carrying amount of creditimpaired financial instruments for which there is no impairment recognised is \u20ac41.1 million (2021: \u20ac50.4 million).\n\n## 4. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates, exchange rates and share prices. Other variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility, long-term dividend expectations and correlations, can also influence the value of financial instruments. The market risk to which we are exposed can be divided into three components. The market risk to which Van Lanschot Kempen Treasury (part of the Other activities operating segment) is exposed in respect of its necessary market maintenance, its structured products activities and services to clients; secondly, market risk stemming from trading activities in institutional securities, which is concentrated at the Investment Banking Clients operating segment. Lastly, exposure to market risks is also generated by investments in Van Lanschot Kempen's management book of \u20ac118.8 million (2021: \u20ac198.4 million). These investments provide seed capital for newly launched Van Lanschot Kempen funds and allow us to co-invest with our clients.\n\n## 4.1  Trading activities in securities\n\nOur trading activities in securities mainly comprise equities and equity derivatives. Equities are concentrated at the Investment Banking Clients operating segment (equity brokerage) while equity derivatives are concentrated at Van Lanschot Kempen Treasury (structured products activities). A governance structure has been created to facilitate effective risk management. The risks are managed using value at risk (VaR) limits as well as gross and net limits. Daily stress tests provide information about changes in portfolio values in extreme market conditions and complement the VaR calculation. The VaR for the trading portfolios is computed daily, based on a one-day time horizon with a 97.5% confidence level on one year of historical data.\n\nThe continued validity of the assumptions underlying the VaR computation is regularly tested using back-testing. Other risks relating to derivatives, which are mainly embedded in our structured notes, are expressed in 'the Greeks' (e.g. Delta, Vega, Rho) and are separately monitored on a daily basis or more frequently if necessary.\n\nSeparate limits are in place for all risk drivers. VaR and other relevant risk parameters are reported to senior management (including two Management Board members) on a daily basis. The embedded derivatives sold to our clients are hedged by Van Lanschot Kempen. Most of the complex market risks (exotic risks) are hedged on a back-to-back basis. The nonexotic risks and limited exotic risks due to secondary market trading are hedged via the macro-hedging strategy. This means that the complex derivatives sold to clients are broken down into individual risk drivers (i.e. delta exposure on S&P500 or Euro Stoxx 50). The total macro exposure per risk driver is calculated and this is hedged by using relatively simple (mostly listed) options. All risk drivers have individual limits and we monitor them daily and/or intra-day, although some basis risks remain.",

The Treasury department is part of the Other activities operating segment. The majority of transactions and positions\n\nin the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Exchange rate risk is managed within the required limits and an authorisation structure applies. Foreign exchange positions are shown in Table 4.2.B and include all cash, forward and option positions of the entities in scope of consolidation.\n\n| Table 4.2.A Exchange rate risk of treasury trading activities (total gross nominal foreign exchange position translated to (\u20ac1,000))   | 2022   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| At 31 December                                                                                                                         | -294   |    442 |\n| Highest position                                                                                                                       | 798    |    449 |\n| Lowest position                                                                                                                        | -3,118 |   -246 |\n| Average position                                                                                                                       | 367    |    185 |\n\n| Table 4.2.B Foreign exchange positions (\u20ac1,000)   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total                                             |    502 |    976 |\n| Hong Kong dollar                                  |    305 |    303 |\n| Canadian dollar                                   |    204 |   -258 |\n| Swiss franc                                       |    155 |   -181 |\n| Danish  krone                                     |    146 |     40 |\n| Australian dollar                                 |    144 |    154 |\n| Singapore dollar                                  |     87 |     38 |\n| New Zealand dollar                                |     22 |     18 |\n| US dollar                                         |    -94 |    396 |\n| Pound sterling                                    |   -687 |    350 |\n| Other                                             |    220 |    116 |\n\nThe capital requirement for exchange rate risk was \u20ac0.1 million at year-end 2022 (2021: \u20ac0.1 million). This amounts to 5% of the net open positions in each currency (2021: 6%). Under the Basel IV rule set, which will take effect as of 2025, our capital requirements for exchange rate risk amounted to \u20ac0.3 million at year-end 2022 (2021: \u20ac0.7 million).\n\nCredit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) is the risk of volatility in earnings and/or equity, caused by spread movements of the yield on banking book instruments that are classified at fair value, versus the swap curve.\n\nFor Van Lanschot Kempen, CSRBB is mainly concentrated in the investment and liquidity portfolios. CSRBB limits have been imposed on these portfolios, which are monitored by ALCO on a monthly basis.\n\n## 4.3 Market risk: interest rate and share-related instruments\n\nWe use the maturity method to calculate the capital adequacy requirement in respect of the general risk on debt instruments in the trading portfolio. Share-related instruments are share instruments included under Financial assets from trading activities (see Table 4.3).\n\n| Table 4.3 Market risk (\u20ac1,000)   | 31/12/2022     | 31/12/2022                    | 31/12/2021     | 31/12/2021                    |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                  | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement |\n| Total                            | 203,308        | 16,265                        | 271,904        | 22,502                        |\n| Interest-related instruments     | 155,210        | 12,417                        | 149,660        | 11,973                        |\n| Share-related instruments        | 46,756         | 3,741                         | 120,675        | 10,095                        |\n| Currency-related instruments     | 1,342          | 107                           | 1,569          | 434                           |",

The market risk of interest rate derivatives is included under Interest rate-related instruments; the market risk of share-related derivatives is included under Share-related instruments; and the market risk of currency derivatives is included under Currency-related instruments.\n\n## 5. Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. Within Van Lanschot Kempen, operational losses are classified using operational loss event types as set out in the Basel framework.\n\nWe have created a range of instruments for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing operational risks to support the bank's management in their roles as risk owners.\n\n- -Operational risk appetite: This appetite defines the level of - quantitative and qualitative - operational risk we are willing to accept. Exceeding this appetite requires the attention of the Management Board and will lead to additional mitigation measures as necessary.\n- -Risk identification and assessment via risk and control self-assessments and scenario analysis:\n- -Risk and control self-assessment is a tool that allows line managers to systematically identify and assess risks so that steps can be taken to manage any risks outside the risk appetite. Risk and control selfassessments are carried out, at tactical (department) level, on the most important value chains of the organisation and on our most important programmes and projects. These assessments are re-performed periodically in order to reassess and update the existing operational risk level.\n- -Scenario analyses are used to assess low frequency but high-impact risks. The results of these analyses are used to provide insight into the adequacy of the Pillar 1 capital requirement vis-\u00e0-vis the operational risk profile.\n- -Risk response: Management is responsible for deciding how to treat risk, and whether to mitigate, accept or transfer (insure) it:\n- -Action tracking: Action tracking is used to track progress made in the delivery of actions to mitigate identified risks, arising from risk and control selfassessments, failing controls, analysis of incidents or complaints, findings by Internal Audit and external regulators, and other relevant events.\n- -Control effectiveness monitoring: To ensure that the most important risks (key risks) are mitigated sufficiently, key controls have been defined; these are assessed on a regular basis to determine their effectiveness.\n- -Risk insurance: To protect the organisation against major operational risk-related losses, we have taken out insurance policies that cover claims and losses resulting from the services offered. Broadly speaking, these policies are a combination of fraud and professional liability insurance, directors' liability insurance and various other liability and accident insurance policies.\n- -Risk acceptance: If a risk is assessed to be outside of the risk appetite and it is not possible or economically viable to lower the risk, the risk can be accepted at Management Board level.\n\n## -Risk monitoring:\n\n- -Incident management: Risks that materialise through an incident are registered in our incidents database via the incident management process. For severe incidents, root cause analyses are carried out. The incidents database allows the systematic recording and analysis of losses resulting from operational risks. It contains information about losses incurred as a result of operational risks in prior years and the current year and forms the foundation of Van Lanschot Kempen's operational risk management measurement system. A total of 88 incidents (2021: 99 incidents) entailing a loss of more than \u20ac1,000 were logged in the database in 2022, resulting in a total loss of \u20ac1.2 million (2021: \u20ac1.2 million).\n- -Risk measurement: This is based on key risk indicators (early warnings), which highlight trends and/or provide prospective information about operational risks.\n- -Risk meetings: Periodic meetings with risk owners are held to monitor the development of the risk profile in relation to the risk appetite.\n\n## Information risk\n\nInformation risk assesses and monitors the protection of client and corporate information. Both automated and manual information processing are carried out. Taking the right measures on the basis of targeted risk analyses of business and IT processes ensures that both our client data and our corporate data are adequately protected and access to this data is ensured.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nThe main mitigants for fraud risk are strong processes with checks and balances (i.e. the four eyes principle) and access control. Incidents such as internal fraud cases are dealt with in accordance with the incident management procedure, which requires a root cause analysis to be conducted, and adequate follow-up to prevent reoccurrence. In 2022, no internal fraud event was identified nor any attempt to commit internal fraud. No investigation of any person regarding internal fraud therefore needed to be conducted.\n\n## Business continuity management\n\nBusiness continuity analyses are carried out as part of our business continuity management process in order to gain insight into critical processes and the resources needed to ensure continuity of service and address potential threats. Embedding business continuity management in the organisation is essential to give the bank sufficient resilience against the impact of an incident or disaster. Business continuity thus has universal scope within the bank; it comprises policies, standards and procedures aimed at safeguarding critical processes or enabling a restart within a specified timeframe in the event of a disaster. The objective is to keep any financial, reputational and/or other material damage to a minimum, both for us and for our clients. Procedures are tested on a regular basis, with tests of fallback procedures and crisis governance carried out every year. Furthermore, crisis management teams and crisis support teams are trained regularly in crisis management techniques and practice using case studies.",

        "page_content": "## Personal data integrity and privacy\n\nThe privacy of our clients is important to us; we therefore handle their personal data responsibly and with care. It's important for every Van Lanschot Kempen employee to understand that discretion and adhering to the core principles of our privacy statement are of the utmost importance. To manage the risks related to personal data integrity, and to manage Van Lanschot Kempen's operations within GDPR laws and regulations, a personal data integrity framework has been set up.\n\nThe Data Protection Officer manages this framework to support the organisation in its obligations; not only to foster awareness, but also to establish the necessary policies, advise on data privacy-related matters, monitor compliance with data privacy laws and report on a regular basis to the Privacy Committee, and to the Management and Supervisory Boards.\n\n## 6. Settlement risk\n\nWe are required to hold capital for financial transactions that are not settled within five days of the agreed deadline, if the difference between the agreed settlement price and the price at the reporting date could lead to a loss. Settlement risk is monitored and managed on a daily basis.\n\nAt year-end 2022, financial transactions totalling \u20ac11.0 million (2021: \u20ac14.5 million) had to be reported in the context of settlement risk.\n\n## 7. CVA risk\n\nUnder the CRR, account must also be taken of the riskweighted assets in relation to CVA, which must be adequate to cover the risk of a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the counterparty in a derivatives transaction (bilateral or centrally cleared). This CVA capital adequacy requirement is additional to requirements applying to the risk-weighted assets in relation to the 'regular' default risk of a counterparty. We use the standardised method to calculate the capital requirement for CVA.\n\n## 8. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the exposure to adverse market interest rate movements, arising from banking book activities. Adverse interest rate movements may impact a bank's current and/or future earnings, capital and market value. Responsibility for IRRBB management has been delegated by the Management Board to ALCO. Interest rate risks in non-banking book items are managed as part of market risk.\n\nOur main source of interest rate risk is the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. In general, assets have longer interest rate maturities than liabilities, contractually as well as behaviourally. We model client behaviour with respect to the prepayment patterns of mortgages and loans and the interest rate risk profiles of savings and current accounts. Client behaviour risk is another important source of interest rate risk, as actually observed client behaviour may deviate from assumptions. Differences between assumed and actually observed client behaviour could have a material adverse impact on future results.\n\nWe pursue a prudent interest rate risk policy that aims to mitigate the effect of prospective interest rate movements which could affect future net interest income, while balancing the costs of hedging activities on current earnings.\n\nWe manage interest rate risk from both a long- and a shortterm perspective. The short-term interest rate risk is addressed mainly from a net interest income perspective (delta net interest income, or \u0394 NII). This involves an analysis of the interest income under a number of market interest rate scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario in which interest rates are expected to develop based on forward rates.\n\nIn 2022, all \u0394 NII scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2022, the most adverse scenario was a scenario in which short term interest rates come down again. The \u0394 NII for this scenario was -4.5%  at the end of 2022 (end of 2021: -6.4%, in a scenario in which interest rates would flatten). Table 8.A shows the interest rate risk metrics.\n\n| Table 8.A Interest rate risk metrics    | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Delta net interest income ( \u0394 NII)      | -4.5 %       | -6.4 %       |\n| Delta economic value of equity ( \u0394 EVE) | -8.4 %       | -7.4 %       |\n\nWe address long-term interest rate risk by means of the economic value approach, which looks at how movements in interest rates impact the value of the bank's assets and liabilities. The rule-of-thumb metric for economic value analysis is duration of equity, which indicates the net impact of parallel interest rate changes on economic value, assuming a linear relationship between these parameters.\n\nAlthough we use duration of equity as a rule-of-thumb for economic value sensitivity, we also calculate economic value changes under various scenarios. In doing so, all interest rate cash flows are replotted and revalued at shocked interest rate curves and we use coupon rates that are stripped from margins. In 2022, all delta economic value of equity ( \u0394 EVE) scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2022, the most adverse scenario was an instant upwards shock of 200 basis points. The \u0394 EVE for this scenario was -8.4% at the end of 2022 (end of 2021: -7.4%).\n\nWe aim to neutralise the impact of differences in accounting classifications on interest rate steering. Hence, we mostly hedge the interest rate risk in fair value items in the banking book on a back-to-back basis, by means of interest rate swaps. By doing so, we make sure that Result on financial transactions - to the extent that it arises from banking book items - is only impacted by market changes in credit spreads over the swap curve and that there is no net impact from changes in the swap curve itself. For this reason, the \u0394 NII scenarios we use to assess our interest rate risk profile do not affect the Result on financial transactions. We use hedge accounting to offset changes in the market value of derivatives that are used for hedging portfolios classified at amortised cost.",

Liquidity risk\n\nThe main objective of our liquidity risk management is to ensure that we are able to maintain or generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations in full as they come due, on acceptable terms. One of the key elements of our approach towards liquidity risk management is to maintain stakeholder confidence in the bank's solidity at all times.\n\nThe main source of liquidity risk that we are exposed to relates to the share of client deposits in our funding base. Although client deposits have proven to be relatively priceinelastic and sticky over time, the withdrawable nature of such deposits poses potential outflow risks, especially for those deposits not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS).\n\nThe roll-over risk with respect to maturing capital market funding is less substantial for us, since our client deposit base comfortably funds our entire loan book. To still obtain a certain degree of diversification in our funding mix, we have covered bond programmes in place.\n\nTo manage liquidity risks, we use a forward-looking liquidity risk management framework that enables the comprehensive measurement, evaluation and calibration of indicators related to liquidity risk. The framework consists of the risk appetite statement, the liquidity buffer, monitoring and reporting, forecasting, funding planning and contingency planning.\n\nLimits for liquidity risk are revised on an annual basis as part of the risk appetite limit structure. Limits set include, but are not limited to, levels of the liquidity coverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio and stress test survival periods, which are reported on a monthly basis to ALCO. The liquidity buffer is the main defensive element against liquidity risk, and the quality and size of the buffer are monitored frequently, along with inflows and outflows in the client deposit base.\n\nFinally, each year we outline our capital and funding planning for a three-year horizon, both under regular circumstances in the capital and funding plan, and under potential future stress or emergency situations in the liquidity contingency plan, complemented by the recovery plan.\n\nPart of our liquidity and funding planning is scenario analysis, of which stress testing is a key element. By means of stress testing, we assess our resilience to a variety of adverse liquidity events - Van Lanschot Kempen-specific events, system-wide events, and a combination of these two.",

Securitisation risk\n\nWe treat securitisation as an asset class in our investment portfolio.

We invest only in the most senior and AAA tranches of RMBS transactions. If they comply with the simple, transparent and standardised (STS) requirements, these securitisations qualify as high-quality liquid assets. All tranches are ECB eligible, meaning that they have at least two ratings from an external credit assessment institution (ECAI).\n\nAs the investments are part of the liquidity buffer, they can be used as collateral, in repo transactions, or sold if necessary. The RMBS portfolio represents a small share of the total investment portfolio.\n\n## Risk exposures within the investment portfolio\n\nThe credit risks of the investments are not hedged. Our investment portfolio as a whole is monitored by the Treasury department and the Credit Risk Approval team on a daily basis. The portfolio is monitored on nominal limits as well as on credit risk limits.\n\n## Management\n\nInterest rate risk is limited, as RMBS are typically floatingrate notes. Interest rate risk is monitored at balance sheet level and includes the investment portfolio. We use the SECERBA methodology to calculate the total risk exposure of RMBS investments.",

As these are relatively new types of risk, we are still developing policies, frameworks, and are collecting data to manage them. At this point in time, the most measurable ESG risks are climate-related, which are discussed in more detail in the remainder of this section. Climate change risk reflects the physical and/or transitional impacts of a change in the climate on Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position and/or reputation. Based on the factors as discussed below, we conclude that no impairments as a result\n\nof  sustainability risks are necessary. Our approach to managing climate-related risks includes aligning our organisation with the ECB's expectations as set out in its guidance on climate-related and environmental risks. The risk to our activities posed by climate change is periodically assessed.\n\nClimate change risks are addressed and managed via the sustainability risk policy. This policy assures risks are assessed from a integrated/holistic perspective, taking all risk drivers and activities into account.

We believe that the sustainability risks of our central bank exposures are limited. Our main exposure is via DNB. DNB has exposure to national commercial banks via their investments in relatively safe assets and is backed by a sovereign entity. The risks run by DNB and the Eurosystem at large are mitigated by the fact that the Eurosystem can correct unacceptable risks by changing supervisory rules. Moreover, DNB, as a monetary authority, is able to accept temporarily negative equity positions, so even large losses arising from a sustainability risk event can be absorbed.\n- 2. Our sovereign and semi-sovereign debt holdings are mainly in the European Union, Canada and Belgium. This debt has a minimum rating of BBB, with 92% of these government and government-guaranteed bonds and SSAs having ratings of AA- and higher, making them capable of withstanding major costs as a result of physical or transitional risks. Also, by signing the Paris Climate Agreement, these countries have committed to build resilience against the consequences of climate change - e.g. rising sea levels - thereby reducing local physical climate risks.\n- 3. Our covered bonds and RMBS holdings are all rated AAA. The majority of the financial assets backed by mortgages are located in the Netherlands, France and Canada. Currently, no loan level data is available to calculate the specific ESG risks on these positions. For our RMBS instruments - where we have direct exposure to the underlying pool of mortgages - some general analytics can be done. The geographical distribution of the mortgage pools does not materially differ from the total issuers mortgage pool, thereby reducing the physical risks. Moreover, there is a substantial credit enhancement present in the RMBS transactions, which ranges from 5.95% to 28.76%, and the average LTVs range from 45.4% to 74.4%. The RMBS instruments in the lower range of the credit enhancement also are in the lower range of LTVs. Covered bonds give additional protection through dual recourse, as the underlying mortgage pool will only be resorted to if the\n\nissuing bank defaults. What's more, the mortgage pool is continuously monitored and if needed adapted, to meet the criteria of the asset cover test. Physical concentration is also taken into account. In our opinion the mortgage-backed financial assets we have invested in are thus capable of withstanding costs arising from physical or transitional risks.\n\n- 4. Private Clients mortgages represent our most concentrated  position in terms of (potential) sustainability risks. Given the geographical characteristics of the Netherlands, we are mainly exposed to physical risks related to fluvial and pluvial flooding. Using highly detailed data on flooding risk in the Netherlands (probability of flood and, if a flood event takes place, the distribution of potential water levels) and specific characteristics of the collateral (house/ apartment), we quantify the potential impact on collateral valuations. Based on internally defined flooding scenarios we determine our exposure to flooding risk. The limited average LTV increase as result of flood damage, given the low probability of such an event, means that actual projected losses are expected to be manageable, In addition, our residential mortgage portfolio is prone to transitional risks which could impact the value of the collateral in future due to rising energy prices and/or renovation costs to meet future legislation on energy efficiency/emissions. Using the characteristics of the collateral (building year, size, current energy label, etc.) we determined the renovation costs needed to improve the energy efficiency of the collateral. Next, the cost of renovation is deducted from the current market value of the collateral to derive a stressed market value as a result of transition risk (we assume non-renovated collateral will be worth less in the future). Given the limited renovation costs, our low average LTV and the on average significant assets of our clients, the transition risks are limited and non-material. In addition, the IFRS provision for defaulted mortgages (IFRS 9, Stage 3) is determined per individual credit file by the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department. If there are significant climate risks relating to defaulted loans, those risks are taken into consideration when the IFRS 9 provision is determined.",

        "page_content": "- 5. Other loans comprise loans to health care specialists and to business professionals such as main audit and law firm partners. These business professionals have limited direct exposure to climate and environmental risks. We also have loans to family businesses and entrepreneurs, with only very limited exposure to sectors which are directly exposed to sustainability risks (energy, travel, agriculture). Based on the limited exposures and non-impacted sectors, the sustainability risks are limited and non-material. If loans are in default the IFRS provision for Stage 3 is determined per individual credit file by the Credit Risk and Credit Restructuring & Recovery department. If there are significant climate risks relating to our Stage 3 loans, those risks are taken into consideration when the IFRS 9 provision is determined.\n- 6. Derivatives and due from banks comprise mostly positions with financial institutions. We annually assess financial institutions with which Van Lanschot Kempen has a banking relationship, testing whether they have at least committed to over 50% of nine well-known international sustainability initiatives. If they have not, we will engage them on this issue. Out of our current 44 financial institution counterparties, all currently comply and there was no need to engage with any financial institutions in our portfolio in 2022. The fact that all have committed to sustainability initiatives and are all regulated by established regulators that also pay attention to sustainability risks mitigates any sustainability risks; hence there were no impairments.\n- 7. Goodwill comprises goodwill attributable to the acquisition of entities such as Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management and Mercier Vanderlinden. These parts of the company are integrated in our sustainability policy, thus managing the various sustainability risks.\n- 8. Other items comprise various relatively small items, with no large concentrations. For example, we have \u20ac118.9 million exposure on our own management book, which we invest in accordance with the Van Lanschot Kempen ESG policy. For the positions in our management book we quantify our climate-related risks based on the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) article classification. As most of the positions are Article 8, we assess our climate-related risks as limited. At the same time, we assess sustainability risks via three defined stress scenarios. Losses resulting from this stress test are limited and well within our current trading limits. As a result of our client facilitation trades at securities trading, we have temporary positions in equities. Within our trading books we assess transition risks via four stress scenarios as defined by our regulator DNB. Based on these outcomes we conclude that our transition risk exposure is limited and well within our current trading limits.\n\n## Off-balance sheet activities\n\nIn our investment management process, the physical and transitional impacts of climate change are taken into account when investments are made or external asset managers are selected. On both a quantitative and qualitative basis, Risk Management measures and analyses the sustainability risks to our investment management activities. All major assets under management (AuM) decisions are made by the Sustainability Investment Council.\n\n## Other\n\nFor our own organisation, climate-related risks are defined as the risk of flooding, earthquakes, drought and other natural hazards that could put the regular execution of our operations at risk. This risk is included in our business continuity stress-testing methodology as one of several scenarios that could lead to a prolonged disruption of facility usage.\n\nIn addition to climate change-related risks, Risk Management is in the process of setting up systems and tooling for assessment of broadly defined sustainability risks, such as biodiversity, human rights, and diversity and inclusion. The adverse impact of  these sustainability risks is measured by principal adverse impact (PAI) indicators. Sustainability risks could very well lead to a combination of financial, reputational and legal problems in the long term if not addressed proactively. Risk Management closely monitors developments in these areas, as we recognise the increased awareness and importance of these.\n\n## 12. Compliance risk\n\nWhen operating in financial markets, it is crucially important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, shareholders, employees and supervisory authorities, but also that we follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our values and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures and industry standards relevant to Van Lanschot Kempen. This increases the longterm sustainability of our business activities and helps us to fulfil our purpose.\n\nWe maintain a permanent, independent and effective compliance function to identify, assess, monitor and report on compliance risk, i.e. the risk of failure by Van Lanschot Kempen to comply with regulations as applicable to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or of undertaking or failing to undertake those activities prohibited or mandated under applicable regulations. Additionally, we have put in place policies and procedures, systems and controls necessary to manage compliance risk.\n\nThe Compliance department is headed by the Chief Compliance Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Risk Officer of the Management Board. The Compliance department fulfils its responsibilities by providing advice and assistance to Van Lanschot Kempen committees and staff, and by continuously monitoring adherence to regulations within Van Lanschot Kempen's day-to-day operations.\n\nFor compliance risk, 2022 again brought changes that impact our regulatory landscape. Implementing and adapting to new sustainability rules and regulations remained one of the focus areas.\n\nWe are proactively responding to these regulatory developments through dedicated implementation working groups in which Van Lanschot Kempen's Compliance department takes part, as well as through other control functions within the company. Special efforts have been made on the implementation of various sustainability-related rules and regulations. As a result, we have been working extensively to adapt policies, procedures and controls to the new regulatory requirements as well as to the demands and expectations of clients and investors.",

        "page_content": "In addition to these regulatory developments, we have devoted, and continue to devote, substantial resources to the strengthening of our compliance framework and our Compliance department across the organisation, including subsidiaries and branches.\n\nThe Compliance department has continued to enhance the compliance framework through dedicated efforts to strengthen our policies and procedures across business lines as well as through the compliance risk management programme and the use of data-driven monitoring to enhance our compliance reporting. We have also continued to develop and deliver a dedicated compliance training and awareness programme for staff. The Compliance department was expanded and enhanced in 2022 by the hiring of additional compliance experts and a new Chief Compliance Officer. Further optimising Compliance is integral to our strategic direction.\n\n## 13. Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for designing and implementing an adequate system of internal control for our financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.\n\nWe have the following tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -A risk and control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -The findings from the review of the operational effectiveness of the internal control system by Internal Audit, which are discussed with the Management Board, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -The Van Lanschot Kempen Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles we pursue with respect to financial accounting;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Management Board and discussion of this by the Audit Committee and by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe management teams of the relevant divisions have provided the Management Board with in-control statements on the extent of internal control, based on the results of testing procedures for the risk and control framework, the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the follow-up of these risks, and the incidents reported. Risk Management and Compliance have evaluated these statements and verified that the business is in control.\n\n## 14. Fair value\n\n## 14.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA portion of the financial instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Tables 14.1.A and 14.1.B provide a breakdown of these instruments into three levels. The fair value is based either on quoted prices in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, or inputs based on data not observable in the market.\n\nWe have developed a policy on the criteria for allocating financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value to each of the three levels. A review is carried out at the end of each reporting period to determine whether any changes have taken place in the hierarchy between the levels.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. Using estimates, we make assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\nThe estimated present value of future cash flows is used to determine the fair value of the other financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The discount rate is the same as the market interest rate at the reporting date for a similar instrument subject to the same conditions, taking into account collateral furnished under credit support annexes (CSAs).\n\nThe fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to forward exchange rates at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates and judgements made are based on past experience as well as other factors, including expectations with respect to future events that could reasonably occur given current circumstances. Estimates and judgements are assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial instruments in this category are assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on the best estimate of management by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, seasonality and credit spreads. A valuation technique is used in which at least one input that has a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. Valuation techniques used include:\n\n- -The net asset value method;\n- -Discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows;\n- -The option model.\n\nA significant effect on the instrument's valuation is considered to be present when the unobservable input accounts for at least 10% of the total instrument's fair value and exceeds a threshold of \u20ac50,000. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.",

This divides the variables used into observable and unobservable market inputs. If the unobservable input variables are significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. An unobservable input variable is significant if the change in the fair value due to the application of the variable is greater than the threshold values. Our policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn 2022, our valuation technique remained unchanged, with non-observable input variables being assessed on significance. As a result of this assessment, some financial instruments included in Derivatives (liabilities) and in Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss have been transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 and vice versa. The Derivatives receivables and payables and Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were transferred to Level 2 as a result of the input variables' correlation and seasonality; the shorter remaining term to maturity of these financial instruments meant that these input variables qualified as non-significant, justifying a transfer to Level 2. In the case of Derivatives (assets), this entailed a transfer of \u20ac0.0 million from Level 2 to Level 3 and a transfer of \u20ac0.0 million from Level 3 to Level 2. In the case of Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, it involved a transfer of \u20ac1.0 million from Level 2 to Level 3. The transfer of Derivatives (liabilities) includes a \u20ac0.9 million shift from Level 3 to Level 2.\n\n## Breakdown of movements in financial assets and liabilities classified under Level 3",

The purpose of the fund is to make it possible for institutional participants to invest in primarily Dutch mortgages with a Dutch national mortgage guarantee (NHG). The fund is set up to facilitate unitholders to hold the investment to the end of the term of the underlying mortgages and provide them with the cash flows (contractual repayment of principal amount and interest cash flows) resulting from the underlying investments. The investment amounted to \u20ac320 million at year-end 2022 and is accounted for as a financial debt instrument under IFRS 9\n\n(at amortised cost) and recognised under line item Loans. The construction depots are recognised in Note 14, Public and private sector liabilities, under line item Other client assets. The impact on the income statement is reflected in Note 23, Net interest income, under line item Interest income on public and private sectors.\n\nThe decrease in Value adjustments fair value hedge accounting is mainly due to rising interest rates and is offset by the increased value of interest rate swaps.\n\n| Loss allowance for expected credit losses (\u20ac1,000)   | 2022    | 2021    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total                                                | -39,999 | -49,452 |\n| Mortgage loans                                       | -4,646  | -2,440  |\n| Current accounts                                     | -15,598 | -25,814 |\n| Other loans and advances                             | -19,754 | -21,199 |\n\nLoss allowance for expected credit losses on Loans and advances to the public and private sectors amounted to \u20ac40.0 million at year-end 2022 (2021: \u20ac49.5 million).

        "page_content": "We have defined six CGUs, namely Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients, Investment Banking Clients, Mercier Vanderlinden, Non-strategic investments, and Other. These correspond to our operating segments (see section on segment information) except for CGU Nonstrategic investments and CGU Mercier Vanderlinden. Segment Other is split between the CGUs Other and Nonstrategic investments. CGU Mercier Vanderlinden is part of the Private Clients segment.\n\nThe impact of the current market circumstances on the performance of the CGUs with allocated goodwill has been limited during 2022, thanks to our solid market position and specific client groups. Although the Private Clients and Wholesale & Institutional Clients segments were impacted by negative market performance, their performance was solid with net AuM inflows, and the projected financial results do not indicate a trigger for impairment. Despite the difficult market conditions, corporate finance results at Investment Banking Clients were good.\n\n| Allocation of goodwill to CGUs (based on segments) (\u20ac1,000)   | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total                                                         | 176,761 | 176,761 |\n| Private Clients                                               | 119,437 | 119,437 |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients                             | 16,031  | 16,031  |\n| Investment Banking Clients                                    | 41,293  | 41,293  |\n\nWe carried out our annual impairment test on goodwill arising from acquisitions in prior years. To determine whether an impairment is necessary, the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is calculated on the basis of value in use. This calculation uses equity cash flow projections for each CGU or group of CGUs for a fiveyear period. These projections are based on the current year and on the financial estimates for the years 2023 until 2026 used by management in its strategic forecast at the end of 2022. For the period after the explicit projections per CGU or group of CGUs, the growth rate is set at the long-term market growth rate of 1.0%. This growth rate applies to all CGUs, as in the long term all CGUs will be impacted by the same economic market developments. The rate is based on our own projections and on wealth management market projections by market experts.\n\nManagement has compared the main assumptions against market forecasts and expectations. Cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and on potential future trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on the estimates include stock and bond market developments, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in client relationships, cost structure, trends in inflation, interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. Equity cash flows are discounted using a cost of equity for each CGU or group of CGUs that reflects the risk-free interest rate, supplemented with a surcharge for the market risk exposure of the CGU or group of CGUs, and a small-firm premium.\n\n| CGU                               |   Discount rate before tax % |   Discount rate before tax % |   Discount rate after tax % |   Discount rate after tax % |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                   |                       2022   |                       2021   |                      2022   |                      2021   |\n| Private Clients                   |                         13.2 |                         11.4 |                         9.7 |                         8.6 |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients |                         16.3 |                         13.6 |                        12.1 |                        10.2 |\n| Investment Banking Clients        |                         15.6 |                         12.6 |                        11.5 |                         9.5 |\n\nThe impairment test performed in 2022 did not result in goodwill impairments. The model uses one base-case scenario. For the CGUs with allocated goodwill, a sensitivity analysis was also carried out on the base-case scenario with particular attention on changes in long-term growth, the discount rate and the long-term EBIT margin. This analysis is captured in the sensitivity table below and supports our conclusion that no impairment is needed.\n\nIn addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life. The acquired  brand names are still active and no objective indication for impairment was apparent at year-end 2022. For the line item Client relationships, changes in the AuM volume are assessed. The useful life tests carried out in 2022 provided no indication of a need for further examination. Consequently, no impairment is recognised for other intangible assets.\n\n| Sensitivity analysis              | Change required in each key assumption for headroom to  equal zero, in percentage points   | Change required in each key assumption for headroom to  equal zero, in percentage points   | Change required in each key assumption for headroom to  equal zero, in percentage points   | Headroom with  terminal growth rate at  0% (\u20ac1,000)   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   | Headroom  (\u20ac1,000)                                                                         | Net profit margin                                                                          | Cost of equity                                                                             | Headroom with  terminal growth rate at  0% (\u20ac1,000)   |\n| Private Clients                   | 432,027                                                                                    | -13.3 %                                                                                    | 5.3 %                                                                                      | 388,051                                               |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients | 87,281                                                                                     | -14.5 %                                                                                    | 14.4 %                                                                                     | 82,785                                                |\n| Investment Banking Clients        | 28,621                                                                                     | -8.2 %                                                                                     | 4.3 %                                                                                      | 26,074                                                |",

Tax losses incurred can be offset against taxable profits in future years. Based on the most recent forecast, it is likely that sufficient future taxable profits will be available to offset the existing tax losses.\n\nThe non-current portion of deferred tax assets that is expected to be recovered or settled after more than 12 months amounted to \u20ac26.1 million (2021: \u20ac32.2 million). See Note 32, Income tax, for more information.\n\n|   Tax losses to be offset (\u20ac1,000) Financial year | Amount   | Final year for offsetting   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|\n|                                              2017 | 543      | indefinitely                |\n|                                              2018 | -        | indefinitely                |\n|                                              2019 | -        | indefinitely                |\n|                                              2020 | -        | indefinitely                |\n|                                              2021 | 4,071    | indefinitely                |\n|                                              2022 | -        | indefinitely                |\n\nThe total amount of tax losses is recognised as a deferred tax asset based on the prevailing tax rate. In 2022, the permanent establishment in Belgium offset all remaining losses to an amount of \u20ac7.6 million against the current year result.\n\nLosses in 2021 arose from VLK Investment Management (UK) Ltd. As the UK does not apply a time limit for offsetting losses, these can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\n| Unrecognised losses (\u20ac1,000)   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total unrecognised losses      | 9,649  | 7,038  |\n\nUnrecognised losses are losses for which it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nThe increase in unrecognised losses is due to the 2022 loss at VLK Investment Management (UK) Ltd.",

Management believes that valuation at fair value through profit or loss applies, as this largely eliminates or reduces inconsistencies in valuation and disclosure, and performance is assessed on the basis of fair value.\n\nThe cumulative change in the fair value of Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss which can be allocated to the changes in own credit risk amounted to a total negative of \u20ac10.7 million (2021: positive \u20ac6.6 million). This is caused by a rise in the credit spread, predominantly at the short end of the curve, coupled with a  longer average duration of the portfolio (due to longer average expected maturities for trigger notes). This is only partially offset by a decrease in the notional amount.\n\n## 16.

Ultimately, we provided compensation to all eligible clients. Their numbers were fewer than we had provisioned for, resulting in a release of provisions and a remaining balance of \u20ac0.5 million.\n\nWe operate a number of employee schemes under which participants receive payments or benefits after they retire. Specifically, there is a pension scheme and a discount scheme for mortgage interest rates, as well as a long-service benefits scheme.\n\nThe following defined benefit schemes were valued for the purpose of the 2022 financial statements:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen employees were eligible for discounted mortgage interest rates. Entitlement to this discount continues beyond retirement from active service. This plan was closed to new entrants after 2015.\n- -The long-service benefits depend on the number of years of service.\n- -The early retirement plan concerns a limited number of employees who were working at the Belgian branch. The outstanding amount is diminishing as this plan has been terminated.\n- -Both a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme are in place for employees working at the Belgian branch. The pensionable salary for the defined benefit scheme is taken as the average basic salary over the last five years of service. The pension capital is insured with UKZT (Uitgesteld Kapitaal Zonder Tegenverzekering). The accompanying term life assurance is funded from risk premiums. The defined contribution pension plans have been set up according to the Belgian method of defined contributions but do not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the defined contribution pension plans are treated as a defined benefit plan in the consolidated financial statements.\n- -Until year-end 2019, former Kempen & Co operated an average salary scheme under which 1.875% of the\n\npensionable salary - salary less state pension offset, with an annual ceiling of \u20ac41,232 - was accrued for each year of service and which was based on a retirement age of 68. The surviving dependants' pension was insured on a risk basis.\n\n- -The pension plan of F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG has been set up according to the Swiss method of defined contributions but does not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the Swiss pension plan is treated as defined benefit plan in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOnly within a Kempen pension scheme, plan assets fund the obligations (i.e. the scheme is funded). The other schemes are unfunded; payments in any year are made directly by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe pension schemes have been placed with insurers and a pension institution, which are responsible for the pension administration, risk insurance and communication of legal documents to employees who are scheme members. Decisions on and changes to pension scheme content are taken by an internal pensions committee. Where applicable, in the Netherlands the Works Council is consulted for its advice and/or approval.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's pension schemes were adjusted and replaced from 1 January 2020 by a single new plan. The new scheme is an individual defined contribution scheme. The former Van Lanschot scheme is classified as a collective defined contribution scheme, and the change of scheme has no impact from an accounting perspective. Because there is still an obligation to pay guarantee costs and to provide indexation on the accrued pension benefits, the remainder of the provision (\u20ac27.9 million) stays on the balance sheet. As it has no legally enforceable right to use the surplus in plan assets for settling the obligations for indexation and guarantee costs, Van Lanschot Kempen applies an asset ceiling to the relevant assets in the pension scheme.\n\nDefined benefit obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method.\n\n| Obligations/assets included in the  statement of financial position by  scheme at 31/12/2022 (1,000)   | Pensions   | Early retirement   | Employee discounts   | Long-service benefits   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Defined benefit obligations                                                                            | 162,144    | -                  | 53                   | 2,617                   |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                                                              | 139,039    | -                  | -                    | -                       |\n| Surplus/deficit                                                                                        | -23,105    | -                  | -53                  | -2,617                  |\n| Obligation at year-end                                                                                 | -23,105    | -                  | -53                  | -2,617                  |",

For the calculations at 31 December 2022, the following mortality tables were used:\n\n- -Kempen's former pension plans: the mortality tables as published by the Dutch Association of Actuaries (Prognosetafel AG2020);\n- -Belgian branch: the mortality table as published by the Institute of Actuaries in Belgium (MR/FR) with an age correction of -3 years.\n- -F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG: the mortality table as published by BVG (BVG 2020 GT).\n\nFor Kempen's former pension plans, a rise of ten basis points in the actuarial interest rate will lead to a decrease of 1.9% in the pension obligations and will have no effect on the current service costs in the statement of income, as no future contributions will be made due to the change in pension scheme.\n\nFor the Belgian branch, a reduction of 25 basis points in the actuarial interest rate will lead to an increase of 1.8% in the pension obligations and a rise of 25 basis points in the actuarial interest rate will lead to a decrease of 1.7% in the pension obligations.\n\nFor F. van Lanschot Bankiers (Schweiz) AG a reduction of 50 basis points in the actuarial interest rate will lead to an increase of 8.1% in the pension obligations and a rise of 50 basis points in the actuarial interest rate will lead to a decrease of 7.1% in the pension obligations.",

The actuarial gains and losses related to a shortfall in minimum performance on defined contribution plan assets, required under Belgian and Swiss law, are also included.\n\nCurrency translation reserve : This reserve (which is not available for free distribution) includes currency exchange differences resulting from the valuation of investments in group companies at the prevailing exchange rate in so far as the currency rate risk is not hedged.\n\nCash flow hedge reserve : This includes the share in the gain or loss on hedging instruments in cash flow hedges that have been designated as an effective hedge.\n\nOwn credit risk reserve : This includes the changes in Van Lanschot Kempen's own credit risk of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nRetained earnings : This includes past profits added to equity and changes in connection with the share scheme.\n\nPostponed dividend : This includes the postponed payment of past profits to shareholders.\n\n## 22.

It is impossible to predict whether, when and how much of these contingent liabilities will be claimed.\n\n## Contingent assets\n\nIn 2021, Van Lanschot Kempen reported a potential contingent asset for VAT repayments related to the calculation of VAT returns for the 2014-21 period.\n\nIn November 2022, the Supreme Court overturned the ruling of the Den Bosch Court of Appeal, which brings the case to an end, and no VAT repayments will be forthcoming.\n\nThe following movements are related to the gross carrying amount of the contingent liabilities and the irrevocable commitments. These figures only include IFRS 9-related items and do not therefore reconcile with the table above.",

This result was mainly driven by three items. First, positive results on hedges for the management book in 2022 at \u20ac11.5 million (2021: -\u20ac9.5 million). Second, ineffectiveness in our hedge accounting model \u20ac9.3 million (2021: -\u20ac6.1 million).\n\nAnd last, the agreement we mentioned earlier - on the transfer of the remaining shares held with the 30% minority shareholders of Mercier Vanderlinden - resulted in a loss of \u20ac18.7 million, which is recognised under the line item Gains/ losses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## 27.

In certain cases, where a company has not been able to repay a corporate loan granted by Van Lanschot Kempen, the loan has been converted into a shareholding, thus giving the company time to recover.",

The discount on the partnership plan contribution in 2022 amounted to \u20ac0.8 million and is included under Other staff costs. The partnership investment incentive amounted to \u20ac0.2 million in cash and to \u20ac0.4 million in share-based payments, which are included under line items Salaries and wages and Share-based payments for variable remuneration respectively.\n\nIn 2022, share-based payments added \u20ac3.3 million to equity (2021: \u20ac2.1 million). Of the total expenses arising from share-based payments, \u20ac2.6 million is included in Salaries and wages (2021: \u20ac1.4 million).

The fair value is equal to the share price less the discounted value of expected dividends during the vesting period. Depositary receipts granted in 2022 had a weighted average fair value of \u20ac16.89 (2021: \u20ac16.41).\n\nIn 2022, 14,003 conditional depositary receipts for shares were granted under the LTP to a number of senior managers other than members of the Management Board (2021: 8,096).\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nThe long-term share plan allows us to award variable remuneration to certain key employees, including identified staff. It offers a special type of variable remuneration in which the total variable pay takes the form of depositary receipts for Class A Van Lanschot Kempen shares. For the LTP, 60% of the Van Lanschot Kempen shares are awarded immediately and unconditionally, while 40% are awarded conditionally over a period of three years for LTP plans\n\nbefore 2022. For LTP plans from 2022 onwards, 40% are awarded conditionally over a period of four years.\n\nConditional depositary receipts for shares will vest if:\n\n- (i) Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows this in the year of vesting;\n- (ii) Risks have been reviewed and no material, unforeseen risks have occurred; and\n- (iii) The individual has not left the company in the three- or four-year period.\n\nConditional variable remuneration can be revised down if so prompted by risks and performances identified later (malus).\n\nEmployees do not receive any dividends during the vesting period. If an employee ceases to be employed by Van Lanschot Kempen within this period, their rights will be forfeited, except in limited circumstances judged on an individual basis.\n\nA proportion (around 50%) of the conditionally awarded depositary receipts is used to pay income tax.",

These are designed in such a way that the voting rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, and the relevant activities are governed by contractual arrangements. Van Lanschot Kempen is exposed to substantially all of the risk of the structured entity and thereby controls it. Therefore, these structured entities do not qualify as a transfer of financial assets and are not derecognised from our statement of financial position.\n\nWe consolidate the following structured entities:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Company BV\n- -Van Lanschot Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Company 2 BV\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen SB Covered Bond Company BV.\n\n## Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Programme (CPTCB)\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen established a CPTCB programme in March 2015. Investors have a dual recourse claim: initially against Van Lanschot Kempen, and, in the event of the bank's failure, against a pool of cover assets. In April 2015, we launched the first bond of \u20ac500 million (maturity of seven years: coupon of 0.275%). The second bond of \u20ac500 million was placed in March 2016 (maturity of seven years: coupon of 0.375%) and the third bond of \u20ac500 million was placed in February 2017 (maturity of ten years: coupon of 0.875%). All bonds were placed with institutional investors.\n\n## Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Programme 2 (CPTCB2)\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen established a retained CPTCB programme in July 2019. In September 2019, the bank launched the first bond of \u20ac300 million (maturity of five years: coupon of 0.4%). All bonds were retained.",

These investments are structured entities. We do not consolidate these because Van Lanschot Kempen is not substantially exposed to all of the risk of the structured entity.

At year-end 2022, both platforms combined had \u20ac6.0 billion in AuM held for around 150,000 clients.\n\nThe transaction will have a negative impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's CET 1 ratio of approximately 0.4 percentage points. A two-year integration path is anticipated, and is expected to involve one-off costs of between \u20ac8 million and \u20ac11 million. The combined platform is expected to break even by 2025 and to start making a positive contribution to Van Lanschot Kempen's net profit thereafter. The transaction is expected to be completed in June 2023, subject to any regulatory approvals that may be required.",

This includes positions arising from group companies. The fair value of financial instruments at amortised cost is taken as the amount for which the instrument could be exchanged in a\n\ncommercial transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. If there is an active market, we use the market value to determine the fair value. For financial instruments for which no market prices are available, the fair values shown in the table are estimated on the basis of the present value or other estimation or valuation methods.\n\n|                                                         | 2022                                              | 2022                                             | 2021                                | 2021                                               |                             |                                                                                                                                                      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                         | Fair value                                        | Carrying  amount                                 | Fair value                          | Carrying  amount                                   | Valued using                | Valuation method                                                                                                                                     |\n| Assets                                                  | Assets                                            | Assets                                           | Assets                              | Assets                                             | Assets                      | Assets                                                                                                                                               |\n| Government paper eligible for central  bank refinancing | 157,214                                           | 160,701                                          | 226,357                             | 223,112                                            | Listed market prices        | Listed market prices                                                                                                                                 |\n| Due from banks                                          | 208,257                                           | 210,186                                          | 195,918                             | 196,500                                            | Observable market  inputs   | Discounted cash flows  using applicable money  market rates                                                                                          |\n| Loans and advances to the public and  private sectors   |                                                   | 8,670,181    9,193,697    9,095,340              |                                     | 8,849,639                                          | Unobservable market  inputs | Discounted cash flows  using current market fees  for comparable loans and  taking into account the  creditworthiness of the  counterparty           |\n| Debt instruments                                        | Debt instruments                                  | Debt instruments                                 | Debt instruments                    | Debt instruments                                   | Debt instruments            | Debt instruments                                                                                                                                     |\n| -

At year-end 2022, both platforms combined had \u20ac6.0 billion in AuM held for around 150,000 clients.\n\nThe transaction will have a negative impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's CET 1 ratio of approximately 0.4 percentage points. A two-year integration path is anticipated, and is expected to involve one-off costs of between \u20ac8 million and \u20ac11 million. The combined platform is expected to break even by 2025 and to start making a positive contribution to Van Lanschot Kempen's net profit thereafter. The transaction is expected to be completed in June 2023, subject to any regulatory approvals that may be required.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, 22 February 2023\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n- -Frans Blom, Chair\n- -Manfred Schepers, Vice-Chair\n- -Karin Bergstein\n- -Brigitte Boone\n- -Bernadette Langius\n- -Maarten Muller\n- -Lex van Overmeire\n\n## Management Board\n\n- - Maarten Edixhoven, Chair\n- -Jeroen Kroes\n- -Wendy Winkelhuijzen\n- -Arjan Huisman\n- -Richard Bruens\n- -Erik van Houwelingen",

The Stichting's policy is solely aimed at pursuing what is described in its objects clause as included in Article 2 of its Articles of Association ( statutaire doelomschrijving ). Its activities exclusively concern holding and managing shares in Van Lanschot Kempen; the Stichting does not engage in any commercial activities.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, at every Van Lanschot Kempen general meeting the Stichting grants a proxy to depositary receipt holders that either attend the meeting in person or are represented by a third party. In other words, depositary receipt holders can always vote at their own discretion for the number of shares for which they hold depositary receipts.\n\nIn 2022, the Stichting's activities consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Convening board meetings (at which the matters mentioned below were discussed);\n- \u00b7 Granting proxies for Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings;\n- \u00b7 Attending Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings; and\n- \u00b7 Exercising the voting rights on Van Lanschot Kempen shares held by the Stichting at Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings, to the extent that no proxies had been granted to depositary receipt holders.\n\nThe Stichting will continue to pursue its policies and activities in 2023 in accordance with its objects clause and in keeping with past practice. No changes in the activities of the Stichting in 2023 are foreseen.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen (in the year 2022 this amounted to \u20ac51,300). The costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as accountancy fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2023 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2022.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn 2022, the Board held three board meetings. The topics covered in these meetings included:\n\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2021 financial statements;\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 25 May 2022 ('the AGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions;\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2022 half-year results;\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the extraordinary general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 6 October 2022 ('the EGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions;\n- \u00b7 The preparations in relation to the meeting of holders of depositary receipts of 16 November 2022;\n- \u00b7 The succession of Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen as a member of the Board and the re-appointment of Mr W.F. Hendriksen as a member of the Board;\n- \u00b7 The meeting of holders of depositary receipts held on 16 November 2022.\n\n## Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings\n\nThe Board attended the AGM and the EGM. The Stichting granted proxy votes to holders of depositary receipts for shares that attended these meetings in person or were represented by third parties. This enabled these depositary receipt holders to vote at their own discretion for the number of Class A ordinary shares corresponding to the depositary receipts of Class A ordinary shares held by them at record date. The Stichting voted, at its own discretion, on the Class A ordinary shares for which no proxy votes had been requested. Such shares represented 53.82% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the AGM and 30.02% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the EGM.\n\nThe Board carefully considered each of the items put to the ballot and after due consideration decided to vote in favour of all items put to the ballot. This included the remuneration report for the year 2021, the discharge of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board, the climate strategy and action plan, the composition of the Supervisory Board and the return of capital by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Meeting of depositary receipt holders and composition of the Board\n\nIn 2022, two vacancies arose due to the expiry of the current terms of Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen and Mr W.F. Hendriksen in accordance with the appointment schedule. Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen was not available for reappointment. Mr W.F. Hendriksen was available for reappointment. The Board considered various candidates and selected Mr R.W.Th. Norbruis as the preferred candidate for appointment to the position previously held by Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen.\n\nThe Board called a meeting of holders of depositary receipts which took place on 16 November 2022. Holders of depositary receipts were given the opportunity, in advance of this meeting, to make a recommendation to fill the Board vacancies. They did not make a recommendation. During the meeting, the Board explained its intention to appoint Mr R.W.Th. Norbruis and re-appoint Mr W.F. Hendriksen. Mr R.W.Th. Norbruis and Mr W.F. Hendriksen were (re-)appointed as members of the Board until the meeting of holders of depositary receipts to be held in 2026. The reappointment of Mr W.F. Hendriksen was motivated by his good performance as a member of the Board and the desire to ensure continuity in the Board. The Board is very grateful to Mr J. Meijer Timmerman Thijssen for his measured judgement in the discussions over the past eleven years and his important contributions to the Stichting as Chair of the Board.",

The Stichting pursues its purpose by acquiring Class C preference shares in the capital of Van Lanschot Kempen, and by exercising the rights attached to these shares.\n\nThe Stichting and Van Lanschot Kempen have signed a call option agreement granting the Stichting the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. When acquiring Class C preference shares, the Stichting is required to pay a minimum of 25% of the nominal amount. To ensure it will be able to pay when the time comes, the Stichting has a funding agreement with ING Bank in place. Van Lanschot Kempen aims to keep any period with outstanding Class C preference shares as brief as possible, and has committed itself to a maximum of one year as the term within which Van Lanschot Kempen will propose to the general meeting to redeem any Class C preference shares.\n\nThe Stichting's policy is exclusively aimed at pursuing the purpose as described above. The Stichting does not in any way engage in commercial activities, or any other type of activities as long as there are no circumstances that, pursuant to its objects clause, would give the Stichting cause to act and exercise its powers.\n\nIn 2022, the Stichting's activities consisted of convening a Board meeting as well as holding ad hoc consultations as and when required.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen (in 2022 this amounted to \u20ac157,601). The costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of a commitment fee due to ING Bank in relation to the funding agreement, the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as accountancy fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2023 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2022.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn 2022, the Board convened for one meeting. Topics discussed at that meeting included:\n\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's annual accounts for 2021;\n- \u00b7 The minutes of the Board meeting held in June 2021;\n- \u00b7 The amendment of the articles of association of the Stichting;\n- \u00b7 The composition of the Board.\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nThe Board appoints its own members. The current members of the Board are:\n\nA.A.M. Deterink, Chair\n\nP.J.J.M. Swinkels\n\nH.P.M. Kivits\n\nMr Deterink is a former partner of Deterink Advocaten en Notarissen.\n\nMr Swinkels is the former Chair of the Board of Swinkels Family Brewers.\n\nMr Kivits is the former Chair of Stage Entertainment.\n\nThe annual remuneration of the Chair of the Board amounts to \u20ac10,000 (excluding VAT), and that of each other Board member to \u20ac7,500 (excluding VAT).\n\n## Expenses\n\nOther expenses incurred by the Stichting amounted to \u20ac127,159 in 2022.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Stichting is a legal entity independent of Van Lanschot Kempen, as referred to in Section 5:71 (1) sub-paragraph (c) of the Financial Supervision Act (Wft).\n\n## The Board\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 14 February 2023",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\n## Advanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB)\n\nThe most sophisticated credit risk measurement technique. Under A-IRB, a bank is allowed to develop its own models, based on direct or indirect observations, to estimate parameters for calculating risk-weighted assets. Credit risk under A-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity (M).\n\n## Assets under discretionary management\n\nClient assets entrusted to Van Lanschot Kempen under a discretionary management agreement, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products (Van Lanschot Kempen index guarantee contracts) or cash.\n\n## Assets under management (AuM)\n\nAssets deposited with Van Lanschot Kempen by clients, breaking down into assets under discretionary management and assets under non-discretionary management.\n\n## Assets under monitoring and guidance\n\nClient assets that are only subject to monitoring, plus minor advisory and related services. Clients make their own investment decisions and Van Lanschot Kempen has little or no influence on the management of these assets.\n\n## Assets under non-discretionary management\n\nClient assets held for clients by Van Lanschot Kempen, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products (index guarantee contracts) or cash, with either a Van Lanschot Kempen investment adviser advising the client on investment policy or clients making their own investment decisions without Van Lanschot Kempen's input.\n\n## Basel III\n\nThe framework drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which introduces a stricter definition of capital and several new ratios and buffers with which banks must comply.\n\n## Basel IV\n\nThe reform of Basel III, commonly referred to as 'Basel IV', involves the final calibration and design of capital output floors, based on revised standardised approaches. It also includes reforms of the IRB approach and the standardised approach for credit and operational risk.\n\n## Capital conservation buffer\n\nCapital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) requires Van Lanschot Kempen to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to 2.5 times total risk exposure as a capital conservation buffer. If an institution fails to maintain this capital conservation buffer, it will be restricted in making discretionary distributions.\n\n## CPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis\n\nGenerally known by its Dutch acronym, CPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis is an independent research institute that provides policy-relevant economic analyses and projections, conducting research on the Dutch economy and on general socio-economic policy.\n\n## Cash flow hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nInstruments to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in cash flows of assets, liabilities or future transactions, arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation.\n\n## Client option positions\n\nClients are unable to buy or sell share options directly on the stock exchange. Van Lanschot Kempen purchases or sells on behalf of these clients and covers this with offsetting transactions on the stock exchange. Such receivables and payables are recognised under Derivatives.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital\n\nAlso referred to as core capital. CET 1 capital encompasses a bank's share capital, share premium and other reserves, adjusted for deductions as specified by regulators, such as goodwill, deferred tax assets and IRB shortfall.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio\n\nCET 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAll commitments arising from transactions for which the bank has given a guarantee to third parties.\n\n## Countercyclical capital buffer\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to the total risk exposure amount (calculated in accordance with the CRR) multiplied by the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates. The countercyclical buffer rates are set by the designated authority in each EU member state on a quarterly basis. The buffer is determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the jurisdictions of the relevant credit exposures.\n\n## Credit-linked swaps\n\nSwaps where variable interest payments linked to Euribor, possibly with a lower or upper limit, are exchanged for credit guarantees in respect of a third party. The counterparty is obliged to pay out if the third party is no longer able to meet its payment obligations. The contract will identify specific payment-triggering events.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk that loans are not repaid, not fully repaid or not repaid on time.\n\n## Credit support annex (CSA)\n\nForming part of an international swaps and derivatives agreement (ISDA), a CSA regulates credit support (collateral) for obligations resulting from derivatives.\n\n## Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)\n\nAn adjustment made on the valuation of derivatives transactions with a counterparty, reflecting the current market value of counterparty credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## Currency options\n\nCurrency options grant their buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a certain currency at a pre-determined exchange rate during or at the end of a predetermined period. The currency option constitutes an obligation for the seller. Van Lanschot Kempen's currency options mainly relate to client transactions covered by offsetting transactions in the markets.\n\n## De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB)\n\nThe Dutch central bank.\n\n## Defined benefit scheme\n\nA pension scheme other than a defined contribution scheme (see below). In a defined benefit scheme, the company has the constructive obligation to make up any deficit in the scheme. This does not have to be based on any legal requirements, but may be simply on the basis of an historical intention on the part of the company to make up any deficits.\n\n## Defined contribution scheme\n\nA scheme in which the company makes agreed contributions to a separate entity (a pension fund) to secure pension rights. The company is not obliged, either legally or effectively, to pay additional contributions if the pension fund does not have enough assets to cover all of its current and future obligations.\n\n## Delta\n\nThe change in the value of an option as a proportion of the change in the value of the underlying asset.\n\n## Delta economic value of equity ( \u0394 EVE)\n\nA long-term economic measure used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. The measure reflects how movements in interest rates impact the value of the bank's assets and liabilities.\n\n## Delta net interest income ( \u0394 NII)\n\nA short-term analysis of the interest income under a number of market interest rate scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario in which interest rates are expected to develop based on forward rates.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nFinancial assets whose value derives from the value of other financial assets, indices or other variables. Van Lanschot Kempen holds both derivatives whose size (face value), conditions and prices are determined between Van Lanschot Kempen and its counterparties (OTC derivatives), and standardised derivatives traded on established markets.\n\n## Discounted cash flow (DCF)\n\nA method to value an investment by estimating future cash flows, taking account of the time value of money.\n\n## Duration of equity\n\nA measure of the interest rate sensitivity of equity that reflects the impact on equity of a 1% parallel shift in the interest curve.\n\n## Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)\n\nThe Dutch regulator for financial institutions in the Netherlands.\n\n## Economic hedges\n\nDerivatives used to manage risks without applying hedge accounting, carried at fair value. At Van Lanschot Kempen, these primarily take the shape of interest rate derivatives.\n\n## Effective interest rate\n\nThe rate that discounts estimated cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset over the life of an instrument, or, where appropriate, over a shorter period.\n\n## Efficiency ratio\n\nOperating expenses excluding impairments and result from the sale of public and private sector loans and advances, as a percentage of income from operating activities.\n\n## Engagement\n\nA sustainability strategy that seeks to persuade companies, fund managers, borrowers and other stakeholders through active dialogue that their sustainability policies should be made compatible with international treaties and conventions.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance factors are used to evaluate companies and countries on their progress in terms of sustainability and ethical behaviour.\n\n## Expected loss (EL)\n\nExpected loss on loans, expressed in the formula EL=PD*EAD*LGD.\n\n## Expected credit loss (ECL) IFRS 9\n\nThe probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e., the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n## Exposure at default (EAD) Basel\n\nExposure at the time of a client's default, also referred to as net exposure.\n\n## Exposure at default (EAD) IFRS 9\n\nThe exposure at default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.\n\n## Fair value hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nA fair value hedge comprises one or more swaps concluded to cover the changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, of debt securities, for example. Hedge relations are typically exact hedges, involving debt securities with fixed rates and terms being offset by swaps with exactly the same terms and fixed interest rates.\n\n## Fiduciary management\n\nHolding assets as a trustee or in another fiduciary role for individuals, trusts, pension providers and other institutions. These assets are not included in the consolidated financial statements because they are not Van Lanschot Kempen's assets.\n\n## Fitch\n\nCredit rating agency.",

        "page_content": "## Forbearance\n\nMaking a concession regarding the terms and conditions of a loan agreement due to actual or anticipated financial difficulties which prevent a client from meeting their obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Van Lanschot Kempen. The concession enables the client to meet the revised obligations. This may also include the whole or partial refinancing of the existing loan.\n\n## Forwards\n\nContractual obligations to purchase or sell goods or financial assets at a future date at a pre-determined price. Forward contracts are customised contracts traded on the OTC markets.\n\n## Foundation internal ratings-based approach (F-IRB)\n\nAn advanced credit risk measurement technique. Under FIRB, a bank is allowed to develop its own models, based on direct or indirect observations, to estimate parameters for calculating risk-weighted assets. Credit risk under F-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD). In contrast to A-IRB, the loss given default (LGD) is included, based on prescribed values.\n\n## Fund for joint account (FGR)\n\nAs part of the partnership plan, partners' individual contributions are collected in a fonds voor gemene rekening (FGR). These contributions remain in the fund during their full tenure as a partner.\n\n## Funding ratio\n\nThe ratio between public and private sector liabilities and total loans and advances (excluding bank borrowing and lending).\n\n## Futures\n\nContractual obligations to purchase or sell goods or financial assets at a future date at a pre-agreed price. Futures are standardised contracts traded on organised markets, with stock exchanges acting as intermediaries and requiring daily settlement in cash and/or deposits of collateral. Van Lanschot Kempen has a number of futures on share indices on its books, partly for own use and partly for clients, for offsetting transactions in the markets.\n\n## General meeting\n\nThe body formed by voting shareholders and others with voting rights.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nAn independent organisation which develops guidelines for sustainability reports. Van Lanschot Kempen's integrated annual report is based on GRI.\n\n## Gross exposure\n\nThe value at which receivables are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, with the exception of derivatives. Gross exposure is calculated on the basis of an add-on percentage of the nominal value (fixed percentages in accordance with the Financial Supervision Act) and the positive replacement value.\n\n## Hedge\n\nProtection of a financial position - against interest rate risks in particular - by means of a financial instrument (typically a derivative).\n\n## International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC )\n\nThe interpretative body of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRIC interprets the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to ensure consistent accounting practices throughout the world and provide guidance on reporting issues not specifically addressed in IFRS.\n\n## Internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP)\n\nA key purpose of the ILAAP is is to document and demonstrate overall liquidity adequacy. This documentation informs a bank's board and regulators of the ongoing assessment and quantification of the bank's liquidity and funding risks, how the bank intends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future liquidity is required. In addition to the analysis of liquidity risk, ILAAP should also include a detailed analysis of the bank's funding profile and evaluation of risks to the stability of the funding profile.\n\n## Impairment\n\nAmount charged to the result for possible losses on nonperforming or irrecoverable loans and advances. Alternatively, an impairment test may suggest lower asset values, if fair values have dipped below carrying amounts and/or the fair value of investments and associates have moved below cost.\n\n## Interest rate option\n\nAn agreement between a buyer and a seller, under which the seller guarantees the buyer a maximum interest rate (cap) or minimum interest rate (floor) for a fixed term.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe risk that profit and equity are impacted by changes in interest rates, in particular in the event of an intentional or unintentional mismatch in the terms of funds lent and borrowed.\n\n## Interest rate swaps\n\nA contract in which two parties exchange interest payments for a pre-agreed period and a notional principal amount, while not swapping the face value. An interest rate swap typically involves exchanging fixed-rate cash flows for floating-rate cash flows in the same currency, with the floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate (usually Euribor).\n\n## Internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP)\n\nStrategies and procedures designed for the bank's continuous assessment as to whether the amount, composition and distribution of its equity still reconcile with the size and nature of its current and potential future risks.\n\n## Internal ratings-based approach (IRB)\n\nAn advanced approach used to calculate credit risk. Van Lanschot Kempen applies only the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach.",

These standards have been adopted by the European Union and have been applied by us from the 2005 financial year.\n\n## Irrevocable commitments\n\nAll obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could result in loans being granted.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in active markets (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. On the basis of its estimates, Van Lanschot Kempen selects a number of methods and makes assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial assets in this category have been assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on management's best estimate by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market.\n\n## Leverage ratio (LR)\n\nThe leverage ratio represents the relationship between total assets plus contingent items and the Basel III Tier 1 capital. It is calculated in accordance with the CRR.\n\n## Lifetime probability of default (LPD)\n\nSee \"Probability of default\".\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nThe LCR represents the ratio between high-quality liquid assets and the balance of cash outflows and cash inflows in the next 30 days.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk that the bank has insufficient liquid assets available to meet current liabilities in the short term.\n\n## Loss given default (LGD)\n\nThe loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is typically expressed as a percentage of EAD.\n\n## Loss given loss (LGL) model\n\nA product-level model evaluating the part of exposure at default (EAD) that may be lost.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk that the value of a financial position changes due to movements in stock exchange prices, foreign exchange and/ or interest rates.\n\n## Morningstar\n\nMorningstar rates mutual funds and ETFs from 1 to 5 stars based on how well they have performed in comparison to similar funds and ETFs.\n\n## Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe relationship between available stable funding and the required amount of stable funding.\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nThe NPS provides information on client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points, the higher the better. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in entities that are fully consolidated by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## OECD Guidelines\n\nThe OECD Guidelines describe what the Dutch government expects from multinational enterprises when it comes to corporate social responsibility. The Guidelines provide companies with guidance in the field of e.g. supply chain management, human rights, child labour, environment and corruption.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe risk of direct or indirect losses as a result of inadequate or defective internal processes and systems, inadequate or defective human acts, or external events.\n\n## Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)\n\nThe Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) provide a framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria in investment policies.\n\n## Probability of default (PD)\n\nThe probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. In our IRB models (Basel), this time horizon is one year. For IFRS 9 purposes, we use the one-year PD as well as the lifetime PD. A default may only happen at a certain time during the assessed period if the facility has not already been derecognised and is still in the portfolio.\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\n\nSecurities backed by residential mortgages. A provider of residential mortgages (typically a bank) will sell these on to a separate entity, a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To finance the mortgages, the SPV will then issue securities called RMBS, which are secured by the mortgages.\n\n## Rho\n\nThe change in the value of an option as a proportion of the change in the interest rate.",
