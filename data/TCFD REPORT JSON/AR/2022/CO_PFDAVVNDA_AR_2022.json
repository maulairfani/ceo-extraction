Today we have our sights aimed towards the future we want to build alongside our stakeholders. A future in which we will continue taking our transformation capacity to even more people and businesses in order to generate progress in the places where we operate, while taking care of the planet and guaranteeing sustainable business growth, leveraged in technology and our characteristic digital essence.\n\n2022 was a year with a challenging and volatile global and regional economic environment, in which we experienced the main consequences of post-pandemic times: there were interruptions in global supply chains and decelerations in the world's most important economies. Additionally, we observed rapidly increasing inflation levels, which led central banks to toughen their monetary policies, increasing interest rates in an accelerated manner. This situation generated direct impacts in our economies, especially in resource availability for families and businesses.\n\nIn Colombia, the annual inflation closed at 13.12%, reaching the highest level reported in the last 23 years, while the Central Bank raised its monetary policy rate by 900 basis points throughout the year, taking it to 12% in December, which is a level not seen since 1999. Uncertainty from an economic standpoint, together with the elections, and the following signals of potential reforms regarding different aspects, were reflected in the market's behavior, impacting devaluation levels for the local currency, as well as participation, inflows and outflows of foreign capital.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this sense, our profits for the year closed at COP/uni00A01.62 trillion, which represented a return on average equity of 10.74%, which was impacted by higher funding costs and provision expenses.\n\nNevertheless, this macroeconomic environment was an opportunity to continue creating innovative solutions, maintaining our leadership in the financial sector in Colombia and Central America, and advancing in all of our strategic pillars, consolidating ourselves as a multilatin, digital and sustainable organization. This way, we connected with new communities and reached 21.8/uni00A0million customers, more than 2 times the amount we had at the end of 2018.\n\nWe remain as key actors in Colombia and Central America with market shares of 16.2% 1 and 9.5% 2 , respectively. Our capital and funding management kept leveraging business growth, allowing our consolidated gross loan portfolio to grow by 22.1% over the year, closing at COP/uni00A0144.8 trillion, out of which 10% currently funds sustainable projects. Our total capital adequacy ratio closed at 16.29%, which establishes us as one of the best capitalized banks in the country on a consolidated basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 21.8 million customers\n\nMore than two times 2018's customer base, by connecting with new communities throughout the year.\n\nWe are aware that 2023 will also be a challenging year, and are prepared to face it. We will work to make our operation more efficient and to offer our customers a world class service, supporting them in a better way with self management solutions that will allow us to be more productive. We will focus our efforts on actively managing our loan portfolio, we will continue participating in the ecosystems where our customers are and will continuously seek to increase our share in the transactional world, generating better results for our shareholders and investors.\n\n## THE WORLD IS OUR HOME\n\nWe are going through a changing environment, which calls for us to reinforce our participation in the financial world's transformation towards a more prosperous, inclusive and clean world. Today we ratify that more than having a sustainability strategy, our strategy is sustainable. We are within the top 15% of the most sustainable companies in the financial sector at a global level in S&P Global's Sustainability Yearbook, and were included for a ninth consecutive year in the S&P Global's Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\n\n- 1 Source: Financial Superintendence of Colombia.

We are aware of our role as a driver for economic development by mobilizing resources. This is why we put forward actions that from a business and sustainable financing perspective mitigate climate change and generate positive impacts in society. We finance projects with a social and environmental purpose, with business lines designed specifically for sustainable housing, low income housing, women led SMEs, electric and hybrid vehicle purchases, among others. Our sustainable loan portfolio reached COP/uni00A014.8 trillion at the end of 2022, growing by 26.5% compared to 2021.\n\nTaking this into account and being aware of our actions, we adhered to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) in order to contribute to the consolidation of a more sustainable financial system, incorporating more social and environmental factors in both our and our client's investment decisions.\n\nPosed with the climate change challenge, we actively contributed to the transition towards a resilient and low carbon economy. From our business, we focused on measuring indirect emissions and evaluating climate change risks associated with our loan portfolios. In order to leverage this labor, we adhered to the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) and incorporated the PACTA (Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment) methodology, aiming to guarantee our contribution with Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. Regarding direct emissions, we actively managed greenhouse gas emissions in our operations, which\n\nallowed us to receive the Carbon Neutral Verification for Colombia and Central America by ICONTEC, which also recognized us as the first entity in Latin America to receive the renewable energy seal.\n\nIn terms of socioeconomic development, we work together with Grupo Bolivar's other companies and other strategic allies to boost social impact ecosystems, capable of promoting the financial inclusion and literacy of communities. Our financial literacy program has been recognized by the Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC) for its quality, pertinence and suitability to eliminate access barriers to the banking system and for promoting healthy financial habits. In this way, we have reached diverse population segments such as farmers markets, artisans, informal vendors, cacao, coffee and plantain producers, among other communities by giving them access to credit, transactional, saving and payment solutions, as well as offering them educational tools that leverage their businesses. In total, we reached 104 farmers markets, 66 thousand informal vendors, 23 thousand artisans and 34 thousand producers, capturing around 13.5/uni00A0million transactions with a business model based on trust, the power to break cultural barriers, and the capacity of transforming cash usage and informal financing habits.\n\nWe work everyday to make Davivienda a more diverse, equitable and inclusive place, in which we encourage empathy and innovation. We are proud that, on average, 30% of our boards of directors are conformed by women, and 42% of our management positions are occupied by women.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA\n\n## Financial Inclusion and Literacy\n\nWe developed ecosystems that promote /financial inclusion and literacy, putting our portfolio at the service of the di/fferent communities and o/ffering them learning tools that leverage their businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This technology seeks to generate a more transparent, agile and safe market, reducing the costs and complexity of issuances, as well as allowing the entrance of more market participants and purveying elements to evolve regulation regarding these types of technologies.\n\n## FOR AN EXCITING FUTURE\n\nAs a result of strengthening our innovation abilities, we put Efecto i at the service of the whole country. This is an initiative oriented towards promoting projects that generate a positive impact in society, strengthening available tools so that young entrepreneurs can leverage their businesses with Grupo Bolivar's innovation methodology.\n\nWe have been learning and growing for 50 years.

Furthermore, Davivienda Colombia won 21 of the 39 awards and Davivienda Central America won 3.\n\nDavivienda is aware of its role in strengthening the entrepreneurial ecosystem through strategic partnerships with hubs, accelerators, government, and startups. As such, our Open Innovation program has led us to analyze over 2,700 startups and implement 13 pilot tests, which culminated in the implementation of 6 innovation initiatives. We also organized forums such as the Health and Wellness Demoday to showcase and promote entrepreneurs.\n\nFurthermore, we stand as a benchmark in intellectual property in the financial industry with a portfolio totaling 390 intellectual property assets, including 5 patents filed by Davivienda, one of which has already been granted by the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce.\n\nOur research observatory supported the Bank's business strategies by conducting 41 research projects aimed at learning about global trends and identifying emerging technologies to keep our businesses at the forefront.

Furthermore, we implemented operational controls, which are key to ensure integrity for our clients, mitigate risks, and enable fraud control and monitoring.\n\nAs a result of the development of new work models, we had a\n\n## 25% increase in the number of projects deployed through automation practices, as well as in the implementation of nearly 185 projects linked to our digital strategy,\n\nenabling us to strengthen our value proposition, improve our customers' experience and drive a 120% increase in the number of transactions, which results into 880/uni00A0million more transactions processed each month. Additionally, we reduced hardware, software, and database obsolescence by 20% on average.\n\nAs part of our efforts to advance digital transformation, we developed projects focused on mobile solutions, customer satisfaction, security, and payment methods. As a result, 80% of our new customers reached us through digital channels. Furthermore, we deployed over 50 APIs enabled to 24 partners, and moved from implementing 4 App versions per year to 14 versions with improved security, service and digital offerings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We also implemented and optimized over 30 operational processes that improved our customers' experience.\n\nFurthermore, the percentage of claims handled on the first line increased from 75% to 80%, resulting in a 90-point NPS. We developed new self-management capabilities for the Davivienda Mobile App, deployed a tool that allowed us to reduce account blocks and declined transactions by 70%, enabled 205 trusted correspondents to support our transactional strategy, and implemented self-management and remote support tools. Now 83% of incidents are handled digitally.\n\n## Furthermore, in 2022 we were the first bank in Latin America to issue bonds powered by blockchain\n\ntechnology. We participated in the regulatory sandbox created by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia and helped with the development of a regulatory framework for cryptocurrency transactions in Colombia, consolidating our position as an innovative organization.\n\nSimilarly, we used blockchain technology to transform the issuance of bank guarantees, delivering a more secure,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntransparent, and efficient process, saving over COP/uni00A01/uni00A0billion and cutting processing times from 30 minutes to 30 seconds, reinforcing our leadership position in this field.\n\nWe harness the power of AI and machine learning to build the first stage of VisionarIA , intended to improve efficiency in managing technology capabilities for project implementation.

Furthermore, we improved vulnerability management, shifting from quarterly review cycles to checks every 4 hours using an automated and smart prioritization process that allows our human talent to focus on relevant issues.\n\nWe are convinced that digital transformation is linked to sustainability. Therefore, we built the QR Vital Pass card for the national government during the Covid-19 pandemic and continue to contribute to economic recovery in our nation. To date, over 19.5/uni00A0million people use this ID card in Colombia and over 1.5/uni00A0million people have been admitted to the European Union. This led us to transform 2,100 tons of paper into benefits for society and the environment, offsetting the carbon footprint equivalent to 2,800 tons of CO/two.denominator.\n\nAs we look forward, we are determined to leverage scores of digital transformation and operational improvement initiatives, not only to deliver a superior customer\n\nexperience, but also to seize every market opportunity and achieve the highest levels of efficiency.\n\nWe will continue strengthening our teams, implementing state-of-the-art technology in each field, optimizing internal processes, forging new partnerships, and consolidating existing ones.

We aim to customize our products to meet the needs of SMEs and respond to market trends.\n\nAt the Bank, we offer comprehensive and customized financial solutions that meet the needs of our diverse customers. To achieve this, we have segmented our market into two main groups: commercial and retail.\n\nIn the Retail segment, the main incomegenerating products are personal loans, credit cards, and savings and investment products. These products and services are designed to meet the financial and investment needs of our clients . Personal loans and credit cards have peaks in usage during the year-end season, while savings and investment products generate more stable income throughout the year.\n\nIn the Corporate segment, the main incomegenerating products are commercial loans and treasury services in local and foreign currencies. These products and services are\n\naimed at companies in various sectors of\n\n## the economy, in order to help them finance their operations and manage their cash flows\n\nefficiently. Demand for commercial loans and lines of credit varies according to the financial needs of companies at different times of the year, while treasury services generate more stable income.\n\nWe are proud to have achieved a solid customer base in both segments. At the end of December 2022, we had close to 19.9/uni00A0million customers in the Personal segment and close to 384 thousand corporate customers in Colombia.\n\nRegarding seasonal income, it is important to note that some of the income may be related to the year-end season, when there is greater consumption and, therefore, greater demand for credit. In addition, it is common that during certain months of the year, such as July and December, the flow of remittances received by customers increases, which translates into higher income from financial services. As for corporate banking, the tourism and foreign trade sector can also generate seasonal income, especially during periods of high demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 19.9 million customers\n\nin the Retail segment and close to 384 thousand corporate customers in Colombia.",

For example, during periods of economic growth, it is common for loan demand to increase, which translates into higher interest income. On the other hand, in times of economic uncertainty, clients may choose to save more and borrow less, which could reduce the bank's income. In addition, cyclical income may also be related to developments in capital markets and investment levels.\n\nFinally, regarding occasional income, it is important to mention that this can come from various sources, such as the sale of non-strategic assets or the recovery of bad loans. These revenues can occur at any time and are not subject to a specific period of the year or market fluctuations. The sale of non-strategic assets may be related to our asset management strategy, while the recovery of bad loans may be linked to the effectiveness of our debt recovery processes or specific decisions to sell written-off loans.\n\nIn terms of our market position, we are the second largest credit institution operating in the Colombian financial system in terms of assets, gross loans, and deposits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is reflected in the steady increase in our market share, measured by loan portfolio balance, which increased from 13.4% in 2015 to 16.2% 6 in 2022.

Meanwhile, our commercial portfolio grew by 14% over the year, mainly due to the expansion of our corporate, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and construction segments.\n\nIn commercial banking, our corporate banking segment has experienced a stable growth trend; we are the third largest bank in Colombia in commercial loans, with a 12.7% market share as of December 31, 2022 8 .\n\nDavivienda goes beyond delivering financial products to provide our customers with unforgettable experiences: we offer them 100% digital solutions to simplify their lives.

This initiative achieved excellent results thanks to joint work between different departments, outside companies, and strategies to benefit agriculture, establishing us as the main advisor and strategic partner for more than 2,000 agricultural and livestock food production projects in Colombia.\n\nUnder ImpulsAgro, the Bank disbursed COP/uni00A0641/uni00A0billion in 34 days, granting more than 400 loans amounting to COP/uni00A072.6/uni00A0billion to over 2,900 clients to finance projects led by rural women, and over 200 loans amounting to COP/uni00A065.5/uni00A0billion to agribusiness companies.\n\n## COP 641 billion in 34 days\n\nThrough ImpulsAgro, due to the collaborative work of areas, external companies and strategies in favor of food production in agriculture.\n\nToday the Bank is deemed as a benchmark on how to technically manage environmental projects, offering various webinars on solar energy to over a thousand participants across the regions. Furthermore, the Bank received five awards presented by Finagro recognizing us as the leading private bank lender for food production and the largest bank with the highest growth in lending to rural women, loans in PDET municipalities and loans under subsidized interest rate facilities favorable to our customers.\n\nSynergies with the British Embassy, Fedecacao, Finagro, Seguros Bol\u00edvar, Fundaci\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Davivienda and DaviPlata were essential in achieving this result, enabling us to push forward a cocoa ecosystem in the municipalities of El Carmen and San Vicente de Chucur\u00ed, in Santander, which collectively account for 42% of national production and are home to approximately 8 thousand potential producers, 95% of whom are small producers. We offered them climate risk insurance, technical assistance, financing to boost productivity, and economic and social development programs to empower the industry. In addition, we delivered technical tips to farmers through mobile phones, in an educational and userfriendly approach: the interactive tool 'Don Jos\u00e9'.\n\nIn 2023, an important part of our efforts will be focused on serving small low-income producers , in line with the country's Agricultural Development Plan for the next four-year period.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These companies are focused on providing a diversified range of products to offer our customers various investment options tailored to their needs and risk profiles. Therefore, we constantly monitor the market and manage different portfolios, offering our customers the best returns by optimizing their risk exposure according to their different profiles.\n\n-   Fiduciaria Davivienda S.A. was established to broaden and diversify the portfolio of services o/ffered by Grupo Empresarial Bolivar by designing products in investment funds and structured trusts; today it is positioned among the leading companies in the trust business in Colombia. The trust company complements its value o/ffer to our clients with a broad portfolio of products underpinned by the know-how and expertise of its executives.\n-   Corredores Davivienda S.A. complements our investment services by o/ffering our clients brokerage, administrative, and custody services for equity and /fixed income securities, including stocks, bonds, term deposits, and TIPS (securitization securities). Our main clients include individuals, SMEs, corporations, and government entities.\n\nIn seasonal terms of the trust business, during the first months of the year there are usually higher investment flows and\n\nthere is an increase in demand for structured trust services, due to the execution of construction, infrastructure and other investment projects that start at this time of the year. For its part, in the brokerage business it has been observed that the last quarter of the year usually presents a higher volume of stock market transactions, since many companies and investment funds try to close their positions before the end of the year.\n\nRegarding the cyclicality of the businesses, it can be said that the investment trends of clients and the activity of the stock market can vary depending on economic and political cycles. In periods of economic or political instability, investors tend to be more cautious and may reduce their exposure to the stock market, resulting in decreased demand for trust and brokerage services.\n\n2022 posed major challenges for our clients investment portfolios. The war in Ukraine, rising global inflation, and the subsequent response by central banks caused turmoil in the markets and a strong appreciation of the US dollar. Additionally, the political climate in Colombia and the tax reform proposed by the new government gave as a result a high volatility in capital market asset prices, which prompted many investors to keep a portion of their funds in traditional bank deposits, fixedincome products and dollar-denominated products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We established 20 new low-volatility, capital-guaranteed investment funds throughout our various investment vehicles. We also launched dollar-denominated portfolios, including a global equity fund. We ensured that the funds' investment policies incorporated ESG (Environment, Social & Governance) evaluation methodologies.\n\nMindful of the importance of contributing to global sustainability, we run two ESG-focused funds (environmental, social and governance) amounting to over COP/uni00A049/uni00A0billion, enabling approximately 7 thousand clients to place their trust in our portfolios, despite market uncertainty prevailing during the year. A recent assessment of the assets in which we invest earned us a AAA rating in sustainability. Significantly, all the issuers in which we invest underwent evaluation processes based on the Grupo Bolivar's responsible investment guidelines, based on the methodology described in the ESG Evaluation chapter.\n\nAs part of our digital transformation strategy, we became the first bank to offer specialized advice through our digital channels, either online or\n\nby scheduling a call with an advisor. Regardless of their expertise level, our clients are able to access advice based on their risk profile and investment goals. 65% of new investments were opened through digital channels by the end of 2022.\n\nIn 2022, along with Davivienda Corredores we earned three major awards for Colombia in the Global Banking & Finance Awards, presented by The European: Brokerage Firm of the Year, Mutual Fund Manager of the Year and Capital Markets Advisor of the Year.\n\nAt the end of the year, Fiduciaria Davivienda managed 41.8 trillion COP/uni00A0(USD 8.7/uni00A0billion) assets and operated Dafuturo , a robust voluntary pension fund, as well as real estate and investments on behalf of its trust clients. Net income for the year totaled 41.1/uni00A0billion COP /uni00A0(USD 8.5/uni00A0billion).\n\nCorredores Davivienda S.A., with over 28.6 trillion COP/uni00A0(USD 5.9/uni00A0billion) in assets under management as of December 2022, is a key part of our private banking strategy. Our broker-dealer has made significant investments in its infrastructure, technology and human talent over the past year to support its strategic objectives and growth plans. Its net income in 2022 amounted to 14.6/uni00A0billion COP/uni00A0 (USD 3.0/uni00A0million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ESG criteria\n\nWe are signatories of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and we incorporate ESG criteria into our investment decisions.",

They derive their revenues from a variety of financial products and services offered in each country, based on an effective integrated value proposition for our multi-Latin customers.\n\nOur international operations in these four countries include loans, letters of credit, debit and credit cards, term deposits, savings and checking accounts, international transfers, online banking services, and local and international leasing (Panama).\n\nOur portfolio of products and services offers products and services for individuals, families and businesses in the communities that extend throughout these Central American countries, in accordance with the regulations of each country.\n\nIt is important to note that our business is subject to certain seasonal factors. For example, during certain seasons there is often an increase in demand for services such as credit cards and travel loans. Also, in certain countries, we see increased commercial activity in the last quarter of the year, which can have a positive impact on our financial results.\n\nOn the other hand, our business is also subject to cyclical factors. In periods of economic recession, we may experience higher levels of loan delinquencies and a decrease in demand for some of our products and services. However, thanks to our strong financial position and the diversification of our product and service portfolio, we are\n\nwell positioned to meet these challenges and continue to provide quality service to our customers in Central America and other markets where we operate.\n\nOur business plan has continued to evolve, in 2022 we achieved positive results in our Central American operations, due to sustained loan portfolio growth, lower provision expenses, and efficiency improvements. Amid a global context marked by rising interest rates, our profit was USD 117/uni00A0million, growing by 68.4% and 10.6% compared to 2020 and 2021 respectively.\n\nDuring the year, our loan portfolio in Honduras stood out for its sustained growth. This includes both commercial and consumer loans. Additionally, Honduras recorded low indicators of delinquency and write-offs. The most significant growth resulted from payroll loans and credit cards.\n\nEl Salvador excelled as the country where the Bank better positioned its mobile card and digital credit card solutions, reaching balances of approximately 40/uni00A0million USD. Credit flows performed well, powered by automation decisionmaking tools.\n\n15 Figures under IFRS accounting.\n\nCosta Rica performed well in terms of the stability of its credit risk indicators, despite a difficult macroeconomic environment prevailing during the first half of the year due to the sharp devaluation of its currency, a trend that was reversed in the second half of the year and allowed for a solid loan origination process, despite the significant presence of a portfolio originated in dollars.

We also extended this methodology to the evaluation of the investment portfolio.\n\nWe deepened our knowledge of the economic activities of customers classified in these sectors, achieving greater support to promote the generation of knowledge, decarbonization and Net Zero commitments, in order to have specific reduction plans for each customer by 2030.\n\nIn the scenario analysis for transition risks, we applied the PACTA methodology, which evaluates the alignment of a portfolio with different climate scenarios based on prospective capacity and production metrics of carbonintensive customers. This methodology integrates global and regional climate scenarios through which the different production trajectories of the included sectors can be analyzed.\n\n## FINANCED EMISSIONS MEASUREMENT\n\nAt the end of 2022 we joined PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials) with the objective of having a globally recognized methodology for measuring the carbon emissions we finance or invest in, considering that these may be the most significant part of the emissions inventory and thus complete the measurement of our carbon footprint. Measuring financed emissions is key to\n\nsetting climate action targets, managing better and aligning with the Paris Agreement. Current target setting initiatives, such as Science Based Targets, rely on baseline calculation for implementation.\n\nThe measurement of financed emissions is performed by applying the PCAF Scope 3 Category 15 methodology to our commercial portfolio at the end of 2021, which we established as the base year.

This line has /financed over 594 billion COP across a variety of projects.\n\nGreen Loans:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Bancoldex and Findeter facilities were leveraged to fund renewable energy projects; protection, restoration, and management of watersheds; and sustainable infrastructure projects nationwide aimed at bridging social gaps through: aqueduct and sewage networks, drinking water treatment plants (PTAP), and wastewater treatment plants.\n\nIn 2022, we worked on implementing the green taxonomy approach de/fined by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC) under the Green Protocol initiative sponsored by the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria).\n\nWe engaged the IFC (International Finance Corporation) as consultants for mortgage and green and sustainable construction products. This enabled us to further de/fine criteria, establish a communication strategy for clients, and align with the green taxonomy. Additionally, it helped us to measure and de/fine indicators.\n\nOur Green Leasing solution o/ffers our customers support to mitigate their environmental footprint via Energy E/fficiency and Renewable Energy strategies, including /financing for solar photovoltaic energy, boilers, transformer replacement, electric vehicles and, broadly speaking, projects involving machinery or equipment capable of achieving at least 15% environmental e/fficiency.",

The German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) awarded Davivienda in Central America the Ideas for Green Recovery (IR Verde) prize, in recognition of the Green Insurance program, which in 2023 will channel 90,000 support entrepreneurship initiatives in communities involved in the mangrove restoration projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| LINE                                   | PROGRESS                                                      |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Green Savings  Account   (El Salvador) | USD 134.3 million in savings  35.7 thousand   products opened |\n| Green Life  Insurance  (El Salvador)   | USD 2 million in premiums  17 thousand   products opened      |\n| Davivienda  Comprehensive  Insurance   | 623.5 thousand   USD in premiums   11.7 thousand              |\n|                                        | products opened                                               |\n| (Costa Rica                            |                                                               |\n\n## Environmental and Social Risk Management System - SARAS\n\nTo ensure that ESG (environmental, social, economic and corporate governance) sustainability criteria are fully embedded into our risk management system, we have implemented the Environmental and Social Risk Management System (SARAS). This system is built into our underwriting processes for loan applications submitted by our corporate and construction clients to develop environmentally sensitive projects or activities. It has allowed us to identify potential risks and to integrate eligibility criteria when assessing investment decisions and managing strategic vendors.\n\nThe Environmental and Social Risk Department of the Credit Risk VP manages the SARAS and reports, when applicable, to the Corporate Risk Committee, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, and the Credit Risk and Investment Committees.\n\nThe SARAS methodology comprises policies, processes, and procedures aimed at identifying, assessing, and managing risks. Furthermore, its scope is well-defined, based on amounts, terms, sensitive activities, and local regulations, when required by underwriting. Moreover, it is aligned with IFC's performance standards and norms and includes a list of excluded/restricted activities for financing.\n\nFor large infrastructure projects, SARAS-based underwriting contemplates the elements outlined in the Equator Principles methodological framework, including due diligence by an independent advisor. The following issues are assessed:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Assesed issues\n\n<!-- image -->",

In infrastructure projects (project finance), we support this process from the loan structuring stage.\n\n## SARAS Performance\n\nTo verify the environmental and social performance of projects and activities that we fund for our customers in the corporate, construction, business and leasing operations segments, in 2022 we assessed the environmental and social risk of 293 projects worth 9.6 trillion COP, and monitored 636 projects and activities financed in Colombia. Additionally, in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras, we assessed 50 projects worth 308 million USD, and we continued monitoring 187 projects. Two projects continued to be monitored in Panama.\n\nIn an effort to broaden the impact of SARAS in the Corporate and Business segments, as part of our Portfolio Rating process and in synergy with the Credit Risk area, we applied a survey to 3,014 companies for the first time in 2022 to learn about our clients' environmental and social initiatives and best practices.

Consequently, as part of the SARAS process, we included procedures, methodologies, and work plans to manage climate change and human rights risks.\n\nFurthermore, to expand our best practices to our suppliers, in 2022 we reinforced our value chain governance. By applying SARAS to manage the bank's strategic vendors, we identify, assess, and periodically monitor environmental and social risks, including climate change and human rights issues, which are addressed as cross-cutting issues. We believe it is highly relevant that our vendors incorporate processes and methodologies for measuring, managing, and reporting environmental and social performance indicators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| INDUSTRY                                      |   AMOUNT |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Housing Construction  and Corporate Buildings |        2 |\n| Manufacturing                                 |        1 |\n| Other                                         |        6 |\n\nIn 2022, we assessed 115 vendors for environmental and social risk.

Consistent with Fiduciaria Davivienda's Environmental Policy, in 2022, we continued identifying, managing, and reporting the environmental and social risks of the structured trust business. This review led us to identify 254 businesses in common, including 74 customers in-scope. 17% of customers of Fiduciaria Davivienda have been assessed to date.",

Under our shared value approach, we encourage and develop business models to address recurring and key social and environmental issues in the countries we serve.\n\n## Multilateral Resources\n\nIn 2022, a key priority for Davivienda in Colombia and Central America was to obtain resources and diversify capital with ESG criteria. In 2023, these resources will be focused on financing social projects, such as SMEs Women and SMEs, low-income housing (VIS) and low-income housing for women; in addition to green financing to support projects focused on sustainable construction, energy efficiency, clean production, sustainable infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## in USD million\n\n|             | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| IFC         | 50     |        |        | 150    |        | 395    | 100    |        | 290    | 985     |\n| BID         |        |        |        | 16     | 200    |        | 270    |        |        | 486     |\n| OPIC        |        |        |        |        | 243    |        |        |        |        | 243     |\n| Wells Fargo |        |        |        |        | 25     |        |        |        |        | 25      |\n| OFID        |        |        |        |        |        |        | 50     |        |        | 50      |\n| Findev      |        |        |        |        |        |        | 20     |        |        | 20      |\n| DFC         |        |        |        |        |        |        | 250    |        |        | 250     |\n| JICA        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        | 150    | 150     |\n| Ecobusiness |        |        |        |        | 30     |        | 25     |        | 20     | 75      |\n| FMO         |        |        |        | 60     |        |        |        |        |        | 60      |\n| Total       | 50     | 0      | 0      | 226    | 498    | 395    | 715    | 0      | 460    | 2,344   |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|             | EXECUTED   | BEING PLACED   |\n|-------------|------------|----------------|\n| Colombia    | 19%        | 81%            |\n| Costa Rica  | 48%        | 52%            |\n| El Salvador | 46%        | 54%            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

With Personal banking we promote a specific focus by increasing access to financial products in segments of vulnerable populations such as SME women, Vis women and Agro. In the latter, we were the first bank focused on products for finance small and medium producers in Colombia.\n\nDaviPlata, a neobank for all, has reached over 15.7 million customers, covering 99% of the Colombian territory. 30% of DaviPlata customers hold DaviPlata as their sole financial product; 29% live in rural areas; 4.4 million are young people; 1.8 million are entrepreneurs who use the 'My Business' feature to boost their businesses; and 1 million are beneficiaries of Government subsidies (Solidarity Income and Youth in Action).\n\nFurthermore, powered by DaviPlata, Davivienda has disbursed over 76 thousand nanocredits exceeding 39.7 billion COP. 80% of these nanocredits were made to individuals who were borrowing for the first time in order to start building credit history. This financial inclusion solution has led us to consolidate ecosystems with social impact in over 563 municipalities, covering nearly 96 town markets and benefiting over 64,000 informal merchants. In 2023 we want to continue on our journey towards financial inclusion as a strategic focus to reach more entrepreneurs, small businesses and SMEs; women; small producers; and young people.\n\nOur commitment to financial inclusion entails integrating social marketing strategies to bridge social gaps and eliminate poverty. Accordingly, Davivienda has supported financial\n\neducation strategies conveying key messages designed to raise awareness among financial consumers (customers and non-customers, companies and entrepreneurs) about the risks and opportunities involved in each decision they make when managing their money, and to help them achieve personal and family financial wellbeing at any point in their life journey (adults, young people, teenagers and children).\n\nAdditionally, our financial education program fosters lasting emotional bonds with our clients and users, based on a unique culture of education for sound decisionmaking, family budgeting, savings, investment, loans, safe handling of products and services, and the appropriate use of technology.\n\nThis strategy provides financial consumers with insights to improve their decision-making processes when managing personal and family finances. Furthermore, it equips them with knowledge about financial products and services through interactive, innovative, creative, and didactic resources. In 2022, we innovated and adapted our strategies to ensure that messages were relevant, convenient, and available, delivered in the most appropriate format for each audience. Therefore, we included behavioral science insights into our tools and content.\n\nOur financial education efforts have led to an ecosystem of platforms aimed at providing useful content for all segments of the population:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt guides data-based investment decision making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelps children between 6 and 12 years old learn about finances through fun activities, games, stories, and videos.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIntroduces young people to key financial topics and decisions key to achieving their financial well-being.\n\nA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelps people achieve their goals and attain financial well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProvides insights to small business owners and entrepreneurs to help them grow their businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelps users to control their budgets by managing income and expenses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have thereby reaffirmed our commitment to building a sustainable financial system, grounded on good corporate governance, integrating social and environmental considerations into our decisions, ensuring transparent accountability.\n\nDavivienda and its subsidiaries, as adherents to this initiative, are committed to act with due diligence and in the best interest of our clients, investors, and other stakeholders. Additionally, it grants us access to a range of tools and services provided by the UN to apply the six Principles for\n\nResponsible Investment in relation to the impact they have on investments in environmental, social and corporate governance issues.\n\nEmbedding ESG factors in an investment decision making process requires an analysis of quantitative and qualitative elements, based on an internal checklist that addresses environmental, climate change, labor, human rights and sustainability issues. Therefore, the sustainability evaluation of each dimension encompasses a range of aspects that weigh differently the companies of the real sector and the financial sector, leading to a final score per company that enables the Bank to categorize issuers in various categories. These results are shared with authorized decision-making bodies to select the issuers eligible for the investment portfolios.\n\nDavivienda uses a heatmap to monitor how portfolios are structured. This provides the Bank with an overview of the status of the portfolio according to internally defined ESG rating criteria. As of December 2022, approximately 89% of Banco Davivienda's Investment Portfolio issuers ranked at 'outstanding' and 'acceptable' levels. The evaluation was conducted based on data gathered from the 2021 management or sustainability reports published by issuers or on direct information from the issuers that answered the survey.\n\nMoreover, we worked jointly with the SARAS unit on a pilot project to characterize Banco Davivienda's current investment portfolio according to transition risks derived from climate change. The results of this assessment are included in the TCFD report herewith attached.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, we advanced this transformation by taking innovative actions around water and energy efficiency, carbon footprint management, and circular economies.\n\n## MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-   We became the /first /financial institution in Latin America to receive the Renewable Electric Energy Seal from the Colombian Institute of Technical Standards and Certi/fication (Icontec) for the years 2020 and 2021, due to our renewable energy production from non-conventional sources in 100% of our operations.\n-   We earned the Veri/fied O/ffset Carbon Neutral status in Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Panama, following the Icontec audit, which veri/fied the 2021 greenhouse gas inventory.\n-   We increased our production of renewable energy using solar panels in Colombia and El Salvador. We generated 553 MWh of clean energy at our facilities, avoiding the emission of 54.2 tons of CO/two.taboldstylee q.\n-   We saved 8,626 kwh and 47,067 m/three.numerator in energy and water consumption through 2022, following the implementation of strategies aimed at mitigating and reducing the negative environmental impacts associated with the use of natural resources.\n-   We invested 8,1 billion in more e/fficient technologies for water and energy consumption.\n\n## CERTIFICATIONS\n\n-   Renewable Electric Energy Seal issued by Icontec: Thanks to our joint work with strategic partners, we became the first organization in the financial industry in Colombia to earn this recognition. We were able to certify that throughout 2020 and 2021 we consumed 57.5 million kWh of clean energy in our domestic operations 21 , derived from non-conventional sources generated in the run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants of the R\u00edo Piedras, Hidrobarrancas and La Rebusca projects, as well as from self-generated energy at offices equipped with solar panels, thereby avoiding the emission of 5,963 tons CO/two.taboldstyleeq in 2020 and 3,522 tons CO/two.taboldstyleeq in 2021 22 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-   Offset carbon neutral status verified by Icontec: We verified our 2021 greenhouse gas inventory for Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, and Panama under the GHG Protocol guidelines. As a result, we can assure our stakeholders that our carbon footprint measurement complied with the principles of transparency, relevance, accuracy, and pertinence. This verification and the fact that we offset our remaining emissions through the IG Farms, SK Carbon and the Galilea-Am\u00e9 Forest Conservation projects, across various regions of Colombia, led us to achieve Carbon Neutral Offset status in 2021.\n\nWe stand ready to take on the challenges to meet our environmental commitments. In 2023, we will continue implementing strategies aimed at advancing towards environmental and climate sustainability in the countries we serve.\n\n- 21 Energy generated at the 'R\u00edo Piedras Project', 'Hidrobarrancas Project' and 'La Rebusca Project' run-of-river hydroelectric power plants and selfgeneration of energy in the o/ffices with solar panels.\n- 22 The facility located on San Andres Island (Colombia) is excluded from the declaration of the use of electricity from renewable sources because it is located outside the National Interconnected System of Colombia.",

We succeeded in reducing emissions caused by energy consumption, as we obtained energy from non-conventional renewable sources acquired through renewable energy certificates.\n\nBy implementing strategies aimed at reducing our carbon footprint and using renewable energy, we have reduced our carbon footprint by 69% compared to 2019, which is equivalent to avoiding the emission of 6,878 Tons of CO/two.denominatoreq.\n\n## 6.88 Tons of CO/two.denominatoreq\n\nAvoided compared to 2019, thanks to the implementation of our strategies.\n\n| SCOPE                     | INDICATOR                                                                                                                       | 2019        | 2020       | 2021      | 2022      | VARIATIONS   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Scope 1                   | Emissions from consumption of refrigerant  gas for air-conditioning and power plant fuels   (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)          | 2,904       | 2,595      | 2,896     | 1,873     | -35%         |\n| Scope 2 *                 | Location-based electricity consumption emissions  (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq) Market-based electricity consumption emissions     | 5,843       | 5,989      | 3,537     | 2,976     | -49%         |\n| Scopes 1+2                | Location-based electricity consumption emissions  (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq))                                                   | 8,747       | 8,584      | 6,432     | 4,850     | -45%         |\n|                           | Market-based electricity consumption emissions  (Tons CO/two.denominatoreq)                                                     | 8,747       | 2,621      | 2,912     | 2,610     | -70%         |\n| Scope 3 **                | Emissions from consumption of reams of paper  and air travel by employees (Tons CO/two.taboldstyleeq)                           | 1,278       | 345        | 195       | 539       | -58%         |\n| Total carbon  footprint   | Total location-based carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.taboldstyleeq) Total market-based carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.taboldstyleeq) | 10,025      | 8,929      | 6,627     | 5,389     | -46%         |\n| Total carbon              | Location-based carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.taboldstyleeq/FTE)                                                                  | 10,025 0.99 | 2,966 0.87 | 3,106     | 3,149     | -69% -46%    |\n| footprint per  FTE        | Market-based carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.taboldstyleeq/FTE)                                                                    | 0.99        | 0.29       | 0.65 0.30 | 0.53 0.31 | -69%         |\n| Total carbon              | Location-based carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.taboldstyle/m/two.numerator)                                                        | 0.04        | 0.03       | 0.02      | 0.02      | -48%         |\n| footprint m/two.numerator |                                                                                                                                 |             | 0.01       | 0.01      |           | -70%         |\n|                           | Market-based carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.denominator/m/two.numerator)                                                          | 0.04        |            |           | 0.01      |              |\n\n- * The Scope 2 /figures for 2019, 2020 and 2021 are adjusted for changes in annual emission factors and for projected energy consumption information by 3% for 2022, because not all power invoices from marketers were available when this report was published.\n- **  Corresponds to eco-e/fficiency /figures, excludes the presentation of the total emissions of the /financed portfolio, which is detailed in Annex 1.\n- 23 El inventario de emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero (Alcance 1, 2 y 3) se realiza a trav\u00e9s del Greenhouse Gas Protocol con un enfoque de consolidaci\u00f3n de control operacional.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Davivienda has been successful in this endeavor by implementing strategies\n\ngeared towards responsible energy consumption across the Bank's operations, supported by strategies designed and implemented by our engineering and architecture Hub, as well as by the public utilities specialized management program. The Bank was able to standardize electromechanical renovations by designing collaborative spaces filled with features to yield a positive environmental impact.\n\nWe installed 140 energy-efficient air conditioners that do not deplete the ozone layer and enable us to optimize energy consumption across our facilities. Also, by creating collaborative workspaces, we continued implementing a hybrid work methodology for general management (onsite and remote work), thereby reducing electric power consumption.\n\nThe specialized utilities management project has enabled us to reduce energy consumption, saving over 6 billion COP since 2019. Furthermore, we have measured consumption through on-site monitoring and the analysis of over 23,000 invoices as of 2022, to characterize consumption and identify opportunities for savings.\n\nWe are aware that our teams are essential to achieve our goals and contribute to the well-being of society and our ecosystems. Therefore, we conducted on-site inspections and virtual training for our branches and administrative areas to raise awareness about responsible consumption habits, reaching 1.814 employees and vendors.\n\n- 24 Additionally, Scope 2 emissions are o/ffset for power consumption from our operation in San Andres because it is outside the national interconnected system - SIN.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We o/ffset 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions\n\nBy carrying out reforestation and clean energy generation projects.",

We also recognize that the optimal development of our strategy must be aligned with technological innovations and the development of alliances with our suppliers and other stakeholders in the value chain.\n\nTherefore, in 2022 we strengthened our circular economy strategy with actions based on raw materials, design and production, reuse, repair, collection, recycling and waste management.\n\n##   Ecological design of products\n\nWe seek to ensure that the choice of raw materials, the design and production minimize negative environmental impacts. We delivered 92,976 credit cards made from 100% recycled PVC sourced by packaging, printing and automotive industries. In addition, our iconic Casita Roja piggy bank is now produced with Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) plastic.\n\n- 25 One ton of recycled paper is equivalent to saving the lives of 17 adult trees. The conversion is obtained by multiplying 637 tons of recycled paper by 17 trees. Source: National Geographic, 2020. Why is it important to recycle paper?

We participated in the toner reverse logistics program with Lexmark. This program allowed us to properly dispose of 1,295 toner cartridges, applying the zero dumping and zero incineration policy. In addition to this program, we carried out our campaign Together, transforming life stories!. During this campaign we collected uniforms in good condition donated by our employees. This allowed us to donate 11 tons of uniforms to charitable foundations.\n\n \n\n## Repair and reuse\n\nWe repaired 2.3 tons of items such as chairs, tables and furniture, which we brought back to be reused in our branches and offices. We donated 50 chairs to Cultivarte in Barranquilla. We sold 3,319 assets to our employees and we responsibly managed the disposition of 128,6 tons of materials that originated from furniture that was no longer in use.\n\nP\n\n5\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, we increased the number of sites that certify their recycling process. We grew from 288 to 384 certified sites.\n\n##   Follow-up on waste management\n\nWe ensure that the suppliers of our buildings and facilities that require maintenance manage their waste appropriately. We delivered 26 tons of waste to authorized companies and correctly disposed of 57.5 thousand cubic meters of rubble and debris from works of renovation and maintenance of our offices and branches.\n\n##   Program 'Batteries:\n\n## if you throw them away you contaminate'\n\nWe continued this program nationwide. Last October we collected 5,878 batteries that had reached the end of their useful life. These batteries were collected not only from our operation but also from our employees' households. We are committed to ensure a proper disposal with our ally and their program Pilas con el Ambiente ('Batteries out of our Environment').\n\n##   Vision 30/30\n\nAs part of our circular economy strategy, we actively participate in the Vision 30/30 Group of the National Association of Entrepreneurs of Colombia (ANDI) in order to maintain the proper management of\n\nour containers and packaging (C&P) and thus contributing to the fulfillment of the national goals, in compliance with Resolution 1407 of 2018.\n\n## Sustainable Construction\n\nDAV.16\n\n## We strive to ensure that our office remodeling projects meet sustainable criteria.\n\nIn 2022 we completed 38 building renovations.

We provided water management training to 100% of the outsourced workers.\n\nIn 2023 we will extend this program to the families of our employees in order to replicate our good sustainability practices and add actions to care for the planet from every home. Our goal is to certify over a thousand of our employees' families, in a program aimed at children, teenagers and adults. The content of the program is to address issues such as the current situation of the planet, issues with resources such as water and energy, responsible consumption, and suitable disposal and management of waste.\n\n## Ecological efficiency goals in Colombia\n\nAs a result of our management, in 2022 we met the following targets:\n\n| INDICADOR                                                                   | TARGET 2022   | VARIATION*   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Energy efficiency (reduction in energy  consumption)                        | 4.4%          | 25.0%        |\n| Clean energy generation (increase)                                          | 185%          | 227%         |\n| Water efficiency (reduction in water  consumption)                          | 8%            | 41%          |\n| Carbon footprint Scope 1 (reduction)                                        | 1%            | 35%          |\n| Carbon footprint Scope 2 (reduction)                                        | 4%            | 49%          |\n| Carbon footprint Scope 3 (reduction)                                        | 17%           | 58%          |\n| Carbon footprint compensation                                               | 80%           | 46%          |\n| Paper (reduction in paper consumption)                                      | 9%            | 48%          |\n| Waste management (branches/offices that  certified their recycling process) | 62%           | 76%          |\n\n- * Calculation with respect to the 2019 baseline.\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n104",

Likewise, with the support of our strategic allies, we improved the adequate waste handling and management in our operations, and we were able to achieve the following results.\n\n-   We were able to reduce breakdowns associated with refrigerant gas leaks in air conditioning equipment by 30%.\n-   We implemented a real-time monitoring system for water and energy consumption. This system allowed us to immediately address and /fix leaks and changes in consumption.\n-   We signed an agreement with the company Huella Colectiva for the reuse of the material of T-shirts with outdated logos or no longer in use: we delivered 27 kg of material for the manufacture of new items using those fabrics.\n-   We were able to increase by 35% the scope of facilities that manage their recycling through partnerships with waste managers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Less is more\n\nLess water, less energy and lower GHG emissions in our operation are more eco-e/fficient.\n\n-   We were able to increase the installation of e/fficient lighting in 65% of all our facilities. We replaced 90 /fluorescent lamps with 75 LED lights in the Torre Davivienda Building, Escazu.\n-   We maintained the bus service from downtown (San Jos\u00e9) to the main administrative o/ffices (Torre Davivienda, Escazu). This allowed us to reduce our carbon footprint by stopping the use of private transportation by our employees.\n-   We were able to o/ffset 100% of our emissions during the year 2021 through the GalileaAm\u00e9 Forest Conservation project and the SK Carbon project, located in Colombia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| INDICATOR                                           | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | VARIATION   | COMMENTS                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| COMMENTS                                            | 103    | 46     | 260    | 241    | 134%        | RWe achieved the reduction                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Scope 2 (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                  | 255    | 210    | 110    | 99     | - 61%       | of our total carbon footprint  by 9% compared to 2019.                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Scope 3* (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                 | 59     | 1      | 15     | 40     | -32%        | This means we o/ffset the  emission of 36 Tons of CO/two.denominator.                                                                                                                                       |\n| Total carbon footprint  ( Ton CO/two.denominatoreq) | 417    | 257    | 385    | 380    | -9%         | Additionally, for Scope 1, we  achieved a 7% reduction  compared to 2021, due to  the implementation of good  environmental practices  following the return of sta/ff into  the workplace - after COVID-19. |\n| Energy (MW)                                         | 3,378  | 2,781  | 2,742  | 2,482  | -27%        | We were able to reduce                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Energy (MW/FTE)                                     | 3.3    | 3.0    | 2.8    | 2.6    | -23%        | energy consumption by 27%  compared to 2019, by means of                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Energy (MW/m/two.numerator)                         | 0.2    | 0.3    | 0.2    | 0.1    | -31%        | technological conversion.                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Water m/three.numerator                             | 19,582 | 10,214 | 13,552 | 11.092 | -43%        | We were able to reduce water  consumption by 43% compared                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Water (m/three.numerator/FTE)                       | 21     | 11     | 14     | 11     | -46%        | to 2019 by the implementation of                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Water (m/three.numerator/m/two.numerator)           | 0.6    | 1.0    | 0.8    | 0.6    | -67%        | efficient use of water projects.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Paper consumption  ( Ton)                           | 20     | 10     | 10     | 13     | -35%        | We continue to promote the Zero  Paper project.

This tool allowed us to take the /first steps towards the integration of biodiversity in business management and to analyze our current situation regarding the potential impacts and risks related to biodiversity. We were also provided with a series of recommendations for targets and measures, which we have already integrated into the 2023 action plan.\n-   We reduced our emissions 75% compared to the 2019 base year. In addition, we o/ffset 100% of our 2021 emissions with the help of the Galilea-Am\u00e9 forest conservation project located in Colombia.\n-   We invested USD $16,000 in the replacement of 16 air conditioning units by energy-e/fficient, non-ozone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- depleting pieces, as part of the program to replace equipment using Freon 410A refrigerant.\n-   We also plan to increase the replacement of the number of outdated AC units that still use Freon 22. .\n-   We generated more than 359 MWh of photovoltaic energy in 5 of our branches. The purchase of 3 more plants has been approved. We also plan to generate further 160 MWh during 2023, and additionally 240 MWh for these 3 plants in the next few years.\n-   We continue the process of Leed certi/fication version 4.1 in Operations and Maintenance for the Miralvalle and Zona Rosa branches. To achieve this, we have already sent the historical measurements of energy, and water consumption, air quality and solid waste management. Our target is to have 2 o/ffices certi/fied in Operation and Maintenance by 2023.\n-   We recycled 21 tons of cardboard, glass, plastic and aluminum waste.\n-   We recycled 9.3 tons of iron from the upgrade of some of the elevators in the Main Building.\n-   We collected 202 tons of used clothing through the 'Together Transforming Life Stories' campaign. Our employees and their families donated used items from Rojo Tu former collections and second-hand clothing.",

This upgrade allows us to contribute to the e/fficient use of energy, to achieve a reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions and to minimize the negative environmental impacts on the ozone layer.\n-   We renovated our sanitary equipment with energysaving /fixtures, making progress in water e/fficiency and reducing water consumption. This is a big plus to our e/fforts in maintenance and the promotion of a positive environmental culture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| INDICATOR                                           | 2019    | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | VARIATION   | COMMENTS                                                                                                                                               |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 1 (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                  | 287     | 564    | 173    | 408    | 42%         |                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Scope 2 (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                  | 3,168   | 2,571  | 3,010  | 3,753  | 18%         | There is evidence of an increase in the carbon                                                                                                         |\n| Scope 3* (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                 | 82      | 26     | 24     | 49     | - 41%       | footprint and energy consumption, due to the  higher number of personnel and following the                                                             |\n| Total carbon footprint  ( Ton CO/two.denominatoreq) | 3,537   | 3,161  | 3,207  | 4,209  | 19%         | return of staff into the workplace.

This is also a commitment within our chain of value. We have been working tirelessly so that in all our different areas and environments we can experience diversity, equality and inclusion.\n\nWe are currently moving forward in the knowledge of our population groups under the framework of our human rights policy. We are in the process of building actions that allow us to promote and enhance equal opportunities and nondiscriminatory, fair and impartial treatment of people in all areas of our organization, without discrimination based on race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability.\n\nDue to the above and with the commitment to further this identification and deepening on the knowledge of our stakeholders, we were part of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee of Asobancaria in order to promote internal and external strategies that allow us to balance the rights of people belonging to minority population groups: women, LGBTI+ population, ethnic-racial minority population, people with disabilities, to all those individuals who are part of our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Equal opportunities in Davivienda\n\nNon-discriminatory, fair and impartial treatment of people in all areas of our organization.\n\nP\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n3\n\n1\n\nA\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nWe strengthened our commitment towards each of our stakeholders. We established our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy, to evolve and achieve milestones that represent the call to action that we had envisioned so much:\n\n-   We created a working group made up of a multidisciplinary and diverse team with di/fferent perspectives. This generates enriching spaces to align all our e/fforts towards the construction of initiatives that allow us to recognize diversity, foster inclusion and promote fairness.\n-   For the /first time, we conducted an identi/fication survey on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, which allowed us to analyze and understand the composition of the population groups within the organization, as\n\nwell as to outline a work path to eliminate barriers, embrace di/fferences and strengthen spaces for each and every one of us.\n\n-   We forged strategic alliances that generate value and leverage our roadmap towards diversity, equality and inclusion. For this reason, this year we joined the ACDI/VOCA Foundation's INclusions Program, with the aim of transforming our environments, providing opportunities that take into account the opinions of each and every one of us.\n-   Since 2020, we became members of the FAW (Financial Alliance for Women). With which we have identi/fied opportunities to strengthen the participation of women and to generate added value for this group.",

We have also provided them with tools for employability and entrepreneurship, expanding their knowledge in different areas such as customer service, pattern making, jewelry design, production of chemical products and Excel skills, so that they could have different income alternatives and help them make a name for themselves in the labor market.\n\n## Supporting women in their goal of buying their first home\n\nOne goal we work on every day is to empower women and provide them with the tools to help them grow economically. That is why in 2022 we provided support to more than 240 thousand women through the disbursement of COP 4,8 Bn Colombian pesos guiding them in their dream of purchasing their very own first home.\n\nWe understand the reality of Colombian women and with our strong commitment to contribute to the closing of gender gaps, we have developed a range of products and services aimed at women, especially those in the entrepreneurial segment, offering them exclusive benefits that will allow them to have access to working capital. We were able to manage COP 1,5 Bn in short term working capital investment to help 21 thousand women to fulfill their dreams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growing together at all times\n\n## We have reinforced our commitment to inclusion.\n\nFor this reason, we provided learning tools to 11 thousand employees on how to care for people with disabilities through the course A world without barriers. By doing so, we have added value to our customers' experience, and have provided a simple, friendly and reliable service.\n\n## OUR COMMITMENT TO THE FUTURE\n\nIn 2023, we will provide continuity to and strengthen the teams working on policies and programs aligned with equality, diversity and inclusion, by working on the following actions:\n\n-   Revitalizing our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) strategy to drive action plans to transform and renew our culture, and the creation of awareness within our organization.\n-   Strengthen data and analytics to understand the diversity of our customers in order to provide them with products and services that are timely and appropriate for each style and moment of their lives.\n-   We have created Plan M for diverse families. This is an initiative that accompanies people's life projects with information on sexual and reproductive health, fertility, professional development and work-life balance. This initiative will enable us to positively impact the lives of employees and people who wish to outline their personal life plan with the support of Davivienda.",

This is done within a framework of governance of the Sustainability Committee of Davivienda. Through this Committee we can ensure that decisions and the monitoring of goals contribute to the objectives of the company. Likewise, in each country where we operate there is a person responsible for each sustainability subject and the chairpersons of the Bank play a fundamental role in all the actions that are carried out locally and strengthen the sustainability strategy.\n\nIn Corporate Citizenship, we combine our shared value approach with the one of strategic philanthropy, striving for a greater impact from different action fronts. For the first approach, we work directly with the Bank's business lines and areas involved, focusing on practices that contribute to the competitiveness of the business and, also, promote the economic and social development of individuals. For the second approach, we work hand in hand with the Bolivar Davivienda Foundation, an organization with which the Bolivar Group reaffirms our social commitment through high impact programs to generate multiple capabilities in the individuals, communities and organizations, and that which aims at building a society that is more socially and environmentally fair, and more economically equitable.\n\n## MAIN ACHIEVEMENTS\n\nWe continued to strengthen our strategy with programs, projects and initiatives that have an impact on the communities. The following were the main achievements of our management during this period:\n\n## Cultivarte Familia\n\nSince 2019, the Bolivar Group has provided support to the community with open and free training provided with 'Cultivarte Familia', a program that promotes the social and economic development of communities based on comprehensive training and an offer of products and services adapted to their financial needs. After 3 years of operation, in 2022 we had important achievements, such as the following:\n\n-   We consolidated the operation of the Cartagena and Candelaria o/ffices, resuming the development of on-site classroom-based programs with a positive impact on approximately 2,000 children, young people and adults.\n-   We established new alliances regarding robotics (IT) and continuing education, facilitating the use of Cultivarte's spaces and educational and entertaining elements for many people to develop new skills that will allow them to have opportunities for growth and development.\n-   With Cultivarte Familia, we won First Place in the category Best Management Program with the Community Segment Industrial, Commercial, Financial and Service Entities of the Regional Awards for Social Responsibility Camacol Valle 2022.

We have a special focus on generating employment for vulnerable populations, especially young people and women, who previously did not have any opportunities for economic growth in rural areas. This new approach enabled more than 100 people to have an opportunity to grow by gaining access, for the first time, to formal employment. Thus, in 2022 we were able to have indicators that made us very proud, such as the following:\n\n-   91% of our employees are mostly young people; 86% of these are women.\n-   This was the /first formal job for 54% of our call center employees. This provided many families with an opportunity for personal growth in the municipality.\n-   72% of them had the possibility of getting substantial material assets as a result of the income received from this job, allowing the municipality's economy to be positively driven.\n-   This is a valuable initiative, which not only generates bene/fits for the workers, but also for the operation. More than 1 million customer calls were answered, with a satisfaction level of 95%.

This program provides opportunities for ludic learning for children and young people, where they are able to strengthen their talents and inspire others to achieve their goals through the development of their skills and abilities. We had the effective participation of hundreds of thousands of participants benefiting from 5 areas of work.

Notwithstanding, as a result of the management carried out, in 2022 we did not detect any violation of human rights in such scopes.\n\nOn the other hand, based on the human rights risk management system in place for the Bank's employees, we can mention that we have a working environment that is conducive to and respectful of human rights, as well as a confidential and anonymous whistleblower channel, such as the Transparency Hotline.\n\nUnder the premise of equality and non-discrimination, we are an inclusive Bank that ensures that the differences that make us unique are respected throughout the organization.\n\nCommitted to continuous improvement, in 2022, we conducted new reviews and updates of the most relevant risks for the organization, involving the different areas of the business, to ensure that proper controls are in place and are being properly managed; this activity will continue during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Under the premise of equality and non-discrimination\n\nwe are an inclusive Bank that ensures that the di/fferences that make us unique are respected throughout the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Those in Colombia accounted for 87.1% of the total payments.\n\nWe share our essence with our allies by implementing a development and recognition strategy that we call the 'Inspira Awards' . In 2022 we had the second rendition of these awards, with the intention of breaking paradigms, redesigning experiences and transforming processes. On this occasion, more than 100 initiatives were submitted by our suppliers and, for the first time, we had the participation of members from Honduras, El Salvador, Panama and Costa Rica in the categories of Digital Transformation, Process Efficiency and Sustainability. For Colombia, we included a new category called 'Partners of the Productive Assets Unit' , designed for suppliers that have designed business modernization projects for their clients in sectors such as transportation, commerce, and industry.\n\nWith this initiative we want to ensure excellent relationships and generate added value for those suppliers, that we consider strategic allies more than mere suppliers, expanding their business and market possibilities thanks to our linkage strategy.\n\nWe are closer to our suppliers with the implementation of a new registration scheme to streamline the process by updating\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour management platform. All linked suppliers are subject to the provisions defined by Davivienda, in which we promote the transparency and objectivity of all their transactions. The supplier linkage policies can be found published on the Davivienda supplier site at the link: www.proveedores.davivienda.com in the section Relacionamiento / in the 'Pol\u00edticas de Vinculaci\u00f3n' chapter that governs suppliers.\n\nTherefore, we take into account, among others, the incorporation of environmental, social and economic criteria in the procurement of goods or services provided to the Bank by third parties. These criteria are based on the Asobancaria Financial System Sustainable Purchasing Management Guide. The goods and services prioritized for making sustainable purchases include IT equipment, electrical appliances, paper supplies, lighting supplies, security services, housekeeping and catering services. We evaluate the environmental and social risk management of strategic suppliers with the probability of greater to lesser environmental or social impact, respectively.\n\nThe Supply Chain Risk Management methodology allows us to keep our supply chain strategy aligned. As part of this methodology, we apply the SARAS assessment to the Bank's suppliers that are deemed to be strategic. As a result of the assessment, we demonstrate the commitment of our suppliers to comply with the applicable environmental and social standards, adequate management to mitigate possible environmental and social impacts, and the implementation of good practices for the use of resources. In 2022, we evaluated 131 suppliers, of which 38% were classified in environmental and social risk category B (medium) and 62% in category C (low).",

This shall generate a transformation in their logistics strategy, under environmentally sound structures and processes, and will translate into a greater efficiency in their use of resources.\n\nIn our short-term expectations, we will seek to consolidate and structure an integrated ecosystem to offer our suppliers a guidance channel on issues related to sustainability (in terms of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion, environment, financial education, among others), agile contracting, new learning and supply methodologies, to improve and develop their capabilities.

In this space of co-creation we work to create and trigger actions that allow us to continue strengthening a comprehensive vision of this far-reaching strategy.\n-   We conducted our Diversity, Equality and Inclusion measurement survey , with a participation of 67%, allowing us to have an assessment of our people and their families. This analysis will leverage the work targets for the coming years, allowing us to work directly on the issues that matter most to people in Davivienda.\n-   In our Engagement survey , we delved into how our people perceive us in terms of Diversity, Equality and Inclusion, obtaining an average rating of 4.5 out of 5, recognizing the organization as a place that values diversity of opinions and ideas. The results indicate that our stakeholders perceive an equitable treatment and feel accepted 'being the way they want to be'.\n-   In collaboration with expert partner organizations, we continue to consolidate the 2023 strategy to evolve in programs, actions and challenges that may allow Davivienda to advance in its commitment to Diversity, Equality and Inclusion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We understand that business needs change and we ensure that our people grow and transform to support the strategy and our clients.\n\n## WE ARE TRANSFORMING OURSELVES TOGETHER\n\nWe work with Universidad Corporativa UXplora , a sustainable and innovative digital ecosystem that is available to the entire organization.

Moreover, they have learning programs designed to meet their specific needs through specialized faculties such as the Analytics, Digital, Sustainability and Commercial Faculties, among others.\n\nAs a result of the training and development strategy, in 2022 we achieved a coverage of 17,447 people, who demonstrated their commitment to the organization and to their personal development.

With Impulsa upskilling , we specialize and enhance the technical and soft skills of our talent with an analytical and digital focus; with Impulsa reskilling , we accompany, develop and transform the current profiles of our people so they can take on new challenges based on a BI Analyst profile.\n\nIn order to use upskilling and reskilling to achieve the objective of the Impulsa Program, we have broken several paradigms:\n\n-   We moved from traditional education to developing 100% digital experiences that are tailored and applied in our business, based on providing support to each person individually and using learning programs 100% digital.\n-   We perceive the obsolescence of some knowledge and skills as an opportunity for the development of our people. We are con/fident that with the talent of our people and with the appropriate support and development plan we can meet the new needs of the organization.\n-   Preserving the essence of our culture, we broke paradigms and managed change in a friendly, reliable and simple way. We have incorporated new machine learning and arti/ficial intelligence technologies in the recruitment process to identify and select potential talent.\n\nWith Impulsa we have been able to reduce the gap in the availability of analytical and digital talent, transforming the organization's mindset and achieving significant results:\n\n-   We have optimized our selection times; we are 20 days below market times for the recruitment of analytical talent and we have optimized the adaptation period for each position by 2 months.\n-   We transformed the pro/file of 41 people from administrative and commercial areas and turned them into a BI Analyst pro/file.\n-   754 people have developed at the level of Analytical Upskilling . 85% at higher levels.\n-   We saved COP 780 million in costs of training for analytical roles.\n-   We reduced by 66% the time invested in training for BI Analyst roles.\n-   We transformed the role of 28 secretaries who now are promoters for the ful/fillment of learning programs and other initiatives for change management. This initiative was recognized as an innovative achievement by the 'Innovation Award, Grupo Bol\u00edvar'.\n-   1,689 Tellers turned their operational pro/file into a commercial and digital pro/file as 'Host Teller', equivalent to 92% of the population of tellers.\n-   We led the transformation of the role of 3,600 information providers (83%) who used to serve the natural market and now have the ability to serve the SME market as well.\n\nAt Davivienda we adapt to global trends and to the needs of our people, thinking of the benefit of all and their wellbeing, therefore, we prioritize the promotion of internal talent with the genuine intention of recognizing the commitment, skills and abilities that our employees have acquired along their journey in the organization. Through internal merit-based competitions, we identify outstanding talent so employees can take on new challenges and continue growing together with the organization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, we transferred 60% of our trainees to permanent positions in the business and we managed to retain 81% of these talents.\n\n##   Talent swaps program\n\nWe have consolidated a worldwide organizational practice that allows us to take advantage of the size and diversity of our organization. Our talent swap is a temporary mobility program that enriches the participants' professional pro/files and broadens their management perspective. Under this initiative, in 2022 we achieved the participation and development experience of 64 people in General Management, Regional and Central American positions.\n\n##   Talent pools\n\nThrough the use of pools we have generated focused development options that strengthen our people, organizational succession, talent retention and other decision making associated with talent. Based on proactive management, we have reduced the /flight of key talent, generating development, labor management and preventive retention strategies with an impact on all the pillars of the work ecosystem.

A professional degree is not required to access these analytical and digital positions anymore.\n-   We eliminated position requirements. It is now possible to move up two or more levels above your current position, as long as you can demonstrate that you have the necessary skills to take on a new challenge.\n-   We promote the self-management of our leaders through an Experience Hub. We have set a platform that allows leaders to boost their teams by managing free time criteria and group activities, among others.\n-   We understand what our people want, so we deliver value o/fferings at the right time.

Over the years, the Transparency model has been integrated to other mechanisms, helping us diagnose, intervene and solve cases in a more comprehensive and complete maner.\n\n## Transparency Management Model\n\nIn 2022, through the transparency model, 288 complaints were managed, this meant an increase of 44% compared to the behavior of the year 2021. To handle these cases, we have an Ethics Committee that ensures that the management of the cases solve the root cause of the different situations; This committee periodically reviews both the cases received and the action plans proposed for\n\ntheir respective closure, guiding and recommending with the premise of zero tolerance for unethical behavior.\n\nIf as a result of the intervention and investigation of a case that identified that one of our people breached policies, omitted processes or acted unethically, the corresponding disciplinary actions are adopted, imposing sanctions according to the nature and seriousness of the facts, always ensuring due diligence.\n\nThe recertification of Principles and Values and the Code of Ethics was carried out, with a 94% participation of our people, which reinforces and strengthens our essence and organizational culture, generating spaces for reflection among our people about how 'We enrich Life with Integrity' being consistent and protagonists the behaviors expected by the organization.\n\nEnriching life with Integrity is our higher purpose, which guides our actions in Davivienda, which is why our people have an 'Open Door Culture' which has contact channels through which people can go to the moment they feel their principles and values have been violated, or that they detect possible irregularities in compliance with our Code of Ethics and identify violations of Human Rights, generating environments of trust that guarantee due care in these matters.\n\nP\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->",

On this basis, the Bank's efforts are focused on compliance with the strategy and control of associated risks.\n\nThe most representative macro-processes or business lines in the strategy or that generate greater risk exposures must be accompanied by specialized risk areas responsible for determining the effectiveness of risk management. This joint analysis of strategy, business units and implicit risks shows that each unit has different dimensions of risk and operational complexities.\n\nTherefore, each business cycle has different dimensions, which are managed by specific teams through risk verticals, whose function is to comprehensively assess strategic, technical and operational risks. At the same time, the risk transversals are in charge of assessing the common risks and independent of the nature of their origin, generated in the processes that support the business units.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given this, we have the following risk management bodies:\n\n##   Board of Directors\n\nThey are the main risk managers at the Bank and Subsidiaries. These evaluate the risks associated with the business and support the work of the control bodies on issues related to risk management, within the regulatory parameters. They de/fine risk policies and risk appetite, and are responsible for ensuring that they are met.\n\n##   Audit Committee\n\nSupervises the activities of internal auditing and /fiscal auditing regarding the evaluation of the methodology and implementation of the risk management model and the internal control system of the Bank. It issues recommendations on risk management carried out by the di/fferent risk committees.\n\n##   Compliance Committee\n\nIt monitors and validates the implementation and execution of the Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing Risk Prevention management program, in accordance with the guidelines given by the Senior Management of the Bank and Subsidiaries, in accordance with regulations and best market practices.\n\n##   Corporate Risk Committee\n\nIt is a support body of the Board of Directors, in charge of ensuring the operation of the corporate risk management system ( Enterprise Risk Management - ERM) of the Bank and its subsidiaries.\n\n##   Chairmanship Committee\n\nBased on the guidelines and approvals of the Board of Directors for the formulation of the Strategic Plan by the President of the Bank, the President's Committee becomes a support body for monitoring and due compliance with the strategy.\n\n##   Risk Speci/fic Committees\n\nThey are de/fined based on the types of risk, the purpose of which is to evaluate the risk policies, mechanisms and procedures implemented, monitoring the various risks, maintaining an optimal risk pro/file according to the de/fined levels and ensuring decision-making. for its management and timely escalation.\n\n##\n\n## Integrated Committee for Regulation and Accounting & Tax Disclosure\n\nIt is the body that proposes the implementation and/or modi/fication of accounting and tax policies and procedures, in favor of regulatory compliance under international standards applicable in Colombia and /fiscal provisions in the generation of Financial Statements.\n\nThe organization strives for the best decision-making that allows for the optimal combination of assets, liabilities and equity, in turn producing the most attractive risk/return ratio for all stakeholders.

These metrics are periodically analyzed by the Board of Directors, the Risk Committees and the Executive Vice Presidency of Risk in such a way that there is a proper understanding of the Bank's risk profile and timely management of risks and their mitigants.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nFor Davivienda, strategic risk is understood as the possible deviation from the expected results as a consequence of strategic decisions, the improper application of said decisions and/or the lack of response capacity to changes in the environment.\n\nStrategic risk management is a continuous process that incorporates both control of strategy execution and comprehensive and systematic evaluation of strategic decisions, in both cases seeking to ensure compliance with the Bank's strategic objectives.\n\nIn 2022, the main macro trends in the environment that have or could have an impact on the Bank's strategy were identified, and it was ensured that there is an area in the bank responsible for monitoring each of them.\n\n-   Adoption of new technologies\n-   Geopolitics\n-   Regulatory changes with an impact on the strategy\n-   Cloud transformation\n-   The green bank\n-   Open banking\n-   New disruptive competitors\n-   Agile banking\n-   Reimagining the workforce\n-   Demographic changes\n\nThe strategic alignment process was carried out, led by the new president and discussed throughout the year with the strategy leaders. From strategic management, it was accompanied by a methodological framework and follow-up meetings that will ensure proper development and alignment with the Bank's corporate objectives.\n\nAdditionally, with the purpose of guaranteeing control of permanent compliance with the strategy and in favor of promoting actions that allow it to be constantly challenged, work was carried out to restructure the general framework for formulating indicators, which incorporates a robust, prospective and cohesive approach. Through which it is possible to holistically and proactively understand the main factors that influence performance and expected results.\n\nIn this way, we complement our strategy board scheme where we publish the results of the different indicators in order to report deviation alerts that could potentially generate risk in compliance with the strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Likewise, it supports the management of transversal risks derived from the processes associated with the business: operational risks, fraud, technology, asset and liability management, compliance and internal control as well as environmental, social and climate change risks.\n\nCredit risk is defined as the possibility that a borrower or counterparty does not comply with its obligations in accordance with the agreed terms, negatively affecting the value of the Bank's portfolio. This risk is mitigated through the due diversification of the portfolios in economic sectors and types of portfolio, the use of guarantees in some types of credits and through the parameters defined in the approval of the risks.\n\nThe objective of credit risk management is to maximize the Bank's profitability, adjusting to the desired risk levels. This objective is achieved by maintaining expected loss levels within acceptable parameters, without ignoring other uncertainty phenomena that may affect the portfolio's result.\n\nCredit risk management is a logical and systematic process, which based on the context of the processes associated with the credit cycle and the stages described above, enables the Bank to identify, analyze, evaluate, control, monitor and communicate the risks associated with the lines of business, products, services and markets covered by the Bank's credit business plan, searching for improvement opportunities across all processes, and seeking to prevent or mitigate both\n\ncredit and operating losses associated with the credit cycle. This entails a risk management cycle by stages as follows:\n\n## 1. Identi/fication\n\nStage that allows determining the risks (current and potential) inherent to the activities that are being carried out, or that are planned to be carried out, according to the de/finitions of the Bank's strategic plan or in compliance with current regulations that apply to the credit cycle. This stage must be completed for the implementation of changes in the business plan, entry into new markets, channels, products and/or services.\n\n## 2. Measurement\n\nStage that allows quantifying and/or evaluating exposure to credit and operational risks associated with all stages of the credit cycle. It also addresses the impact and consequence when it takes place. Risk quanti/fication includes the following factors:\n\n-   Likelihood: Quanti/fication of likelihood of default of the di/fferent segments as well as situations and uncertainty shocks that may modify them.\n-   Risk Impact: Quanti/fication of the magnitude of the losses taking into account not only the likelihood of default but also the exposure and loss given the default to quantify the expected and/or incurred loss and its impact on the bank's results.\n-   Velocity: Measurement of the moment in which the impact of the risk begins to materialize after the occurrence of the risk.\n-   Duration : Persistence of the event of default on the results of the bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Control\n\nDuring this stage, the mechanisms tending to mitigate and manage the materialization of the risks associated with the credit cycle must be established. These mechanisms refer to the policies, procedures and methodologies associated with the credit cycle: origination, deepening and recovery. It also includes the operational controls to ensure that they are duly implemented. The controls should make it possible to know the degree of compliance with the established regulatory thresholds and/or limits, as well as to have updated, reliable, timely and complete information for decision making.\n\n## 4. Monitoring\n\nCarry out permanent and e/ffective monitoring of risks sources in the credit cycle, deviations from limits and/or thresholds, the e/ffectiveness of the controls implemented and the possible impact of the materialization of risks. Such deviations are detected through portfolio monitoring, and then they are corrected by the appropriate government agencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cost e/ffectiveness\n\nThe objective of credit risk management is to maximize the Bank's pro/fitability, within the desired risk levels.",

This forced a greater demand for this type of credit and an increase in its risk level. Measures have been implemented from the second half of the year, to improve the quality of the credit portfolio and to reestablish the desirable level of expected loss for this portfolio.\n\nIn order to deal with this situation, and trying to achieve the recomposition of the portfolio, a decrease in growth rates and an increase in quality indicators in the short term, the credit risk management focused on the implementation of action plans for the different aspects of the credit cycle (origination policies, changes in deepening schemes and new alternatives for collection management).\n\nIn the case of the commercial portfolio, the impacts of the increase in the costs of supplies, especially fertilizers and some imports from the agricultural sector, the debtors of the commercial portfolio were affected slightly, and the sector of the construction suffered a moderate impact. We continue to monitor our portfolio of companies to detect risk factors such as increased costs, the effect of interest rates, inflation and the effect of the devaluation/revaluation of the peso for those debtors with exposure in foreign currency.\n\nRegarding the International Subsidiaries, the portfolio showed significant growth during the year 2022. The growth was 35.8% in pesos (12.5% in dollars). This growth was driven by the commercial portfolio, followed by the consumer portfolio. However, housing had the lowest growth in this period.

The above was generated mainly by factors such as the growth of the balance, the improvement in the behavior of payments and the timely management of collections which have contributed to the improvement of the indicator.\n\nOn the other hand, the indicator of the consumer portfolio closed at 3.23%, reflecting an increase explained by a slower rate of growth by the end of the year. In addition to the above, the behavior of personal loans (for unrestricted use) was evidently affected by the payment capacity of some clients due to macroeconomic conditions.

This contingency likelihood (funding liquidity risk) is evidenced in the insufficiency of available liquid assets and/or in the need to assume unusual funding costs. In turn, the capability of the organizations to generate or unwind financial positions at market prices is limited either because there is no adequate market depth or because of drastic changes in rates and prices (market liquidity risk). Similarly, for businesses that are funded through deposits, liquidity risk includes the capability to generate a stable long-term funding structure in order to maintain non-liquid assets, in accordance with the business strategy, and to be able to meet unanticipated stress situations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this reason, the Program includes procedures and controls that ensure compliance with defined policies.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nFraud Risk is classified as any illegal act whose characteristics may be deceit, concealment or violation of trust and whose objective is the appropriation of money, goods, services and/or individual advantages or benefits. It has been managed by Banco Davivienda through the Fraud risk management system (Sarfra, for its acronym in Spanish) in compliance with the regulatory framework of the Operational Risk Management system (Saro).\n\nThe management carried out covers each stage of the fraud management cycle: prevention, detection, mitigation, analysis, government, investigation, prosecution and deterrence, generating controls, policies and reports of both management and expenses incurred due to fraud, evaluated against the budget projection defined by the Bank. These reports of expenses due to the occurrence are implicit in the management of Operational Risk and are presented to the Cybersecurity and Transactional Fraud Prevention Committee for decision-making that protects the organization, our clients, shareholders and other interested parties in the search for balance between the level of fraud to be prevented and the impact on the client and the business.\n\nIn the work plan developed during the year 2022, Banco Davivienda advanced and completed the implementation of fraud prevention tools, mainly for digital products, protecting the transactional security of our clients, strengthening the fraud risk prevention, mitigation and management model, as well as analytics both domestic and of our National and International Subsidiaries. During this period of time, the Bank faced relevant challenges in the design of strategies for the prevention and mitigation of fraud derived from the linking of clients through identity theft; these challenges were leveraged by the strengthening of the authentication systems associated with registration, login and transactional challenges for clients. In addition to this, the capacity to validate the information registered by customers or fraudsters at the time of first entry was expanded. Said validation triggered a reduction in the occurrence of this type of fraud for the period mentioned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Their objective is to strengthen and improve the bank's corporate reputation, to integrate shared value using all capacity, resources and talent to contribute to the social progress, a sustainable development and economic success.\n\nThe study that was carried out by Merco Empresas and Lideres Colombia, and that evaluates the reputation of companies and their leaders, is a reference for us, since it is an external view, to determine in which aspects we have made progress and in which items we should further concentrate our efforts. In 2022 we ranked number 10 in the country, going up 2 places compared to 2021. We ranked as the second company with the best reputation within the financial sector.\n\nWe have consolidated our brand through messages that are characterized by maintaining the close and cheerful tone of the brand, seeking a greater connection with the public and trying to produce smiles and create experiences for them, in addition to publicizing reporting news, initiatives and achievements of the organization.\n\nOur actions, in 2022, were planned to continue working on attracting the young population to our brand, taking advantage of channels relevant to them, such as Twitch and Tik Tok. We have evolved so that not only the brand communication was the key element, but we also made inroads with product proposals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EMERGING RISKS\n\nComprehensive Risk Management includes the review of the risk management processes and the allocation of resources to ensure that emerging risks are correctly identified, assessed, and controlled from the strategic management to day-to-day processes at all levels of the organization.\n\nAt Davivienda we continually review the conditions of the environment in order to identify changes that may affect the objectives and the strategy of the business. We then implement the necessary adjustments to adapt to changes in our environment.\n\nBased on the organization's strategy and objectives, the Senior Management has identified 4 emerging risks that we have been monitored and controlled:\n\n## Geopolitical risk\n\nIt is related to the political, economic, and social uncertainty caused by large-scale events at local, regional, or global levels. These include international conflicts, deglobalization, political decisions at the local and international level, and social events that may affect the economic stability of countries, among others. They may have an effect on Colombia and may impact its macroeconomic variables, especially export earnings, capital flows and foreign remittances. The Bank would be affected by the deterioration of the portfolio caused by the lack of ability to pay financial obligations and the savings and investment capacity of our customers.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine have had a strong impact on the supply chain, such as food, energy and microprocessors. This has accelerated the process of reorganization of the trading blocs.\n\nThis type of situation raises questions as to how strong the fragmentation of trade, services, investment and migration channels will become, and whether new isolated power blocs will be created in the physical and virtual worlds. There are also economic impacts in terms of increased costs of goods produced, as purchases are no longer made from the most efficient global suppliers, and there are negative effects of the absence of international cooperation on the control of the effects of climate change, cyber-attacks and transnational crime. The concentration of countries on solving their own problems may also result in a decrease in international solidarity towards the poorest countries.\n\nIn 2023, a slowdown in global economic growth is expected, and some countries are even talking about recession, due to the possible continuation of contractive monetary measures by many central banks in their eagerness to contain record levels of inflation. Also, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine continues to exert pressure on international supply.\n\nIn this context, and despite the risk of recession in several developed countries, particularly the United States, the disinflation of the U.S. economy, together with the increase in wages in the short term, have surely reduced the risk of a recession this year. However, there is a simultaneous risk that the\n\nU.S. monetary authority may have to increase interest rates even more than the markets have been anticipating. There are two reasons for this: one is related to the uncertainty of the inflation projections in that economy, and the other is derived from the monetary authorities' commitment to controlling inflation.\n\nIn Colombia, the economy is more vulnerable due to a higher fiscal deficit and the effects of changes in the economic policy of developed countries. To this, we must add two other factors of uncertainty: the scope of the policies that the National Government will implement and the effect that the tax reform may have on the country's growth.\n\nTo manage these risks, we measure, monitor and control the risk associated with the factors that could affect investments abroad, which includes analysis on the deterioration of macroeconomic, political and legal variables in different countries that are recipients of the Bank's investment. This analysis involves the participation of the Bank's economic studies, corporate credit and legal areas, which escalate the potential risk to the governing bodies, in an attempt to mitigate exposure to geopolitical risks and international exposure to financial contagion.\n\nAdditionally, our area of economic studies periodically analyzes international economic policies and reports to the Senior Management and the Board of Directors on the main events that have occurred in the financial markets, as well as about local and international macroeconomic perspectives, including projection models. Likewise, the risk committees and our business areas continue to monitor the behavior of our clients with regards to savings and payment and the behavior of the sectors in which they operate in order to generate the action plans that are required.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Geopolitical risk management\n\nTo manage this risk, we measure, analyze, monitor and control the risk associated with geopolitical factors that could a/ffect our investments abroad.\n\n## Risk derived from new disruptive competitors\n\nDigital transformation processes have had an accelerated evolution in recent years, and with them we have experienced the arrival of disruptive players who offer specialized, low-cost products and services, without physical channels and with a personalized and agile level of service. Year 2022 was a year where a new 'cleansed' landscape was on the horizon where capital costs have forced less profitable financial technology (fintech) businesses to disappear due to valuation corrections that focus more on profitability and not so much on growth.\n\nFor Davivienda, the consolidation of these new competitors could imply a loss of customers, a decrease in income, a lower market share and adjustments in the functionality of the channels with higher costs. But at the same time, it is an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation, to create new business models based on open banking and to compete with a 100% mobile and personalized offer for segments such as young people and SMEs. Davivienda has defined new strategic focuses that will allow it to differentiate ourselves and face the new competitive environment.\n\nDaviPlata in 2022 consolidated as a neobank. This has made it easier for people to move money on a day-to-day basis to build ecosystems that facilitate their activities and to connect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n162",

At the end of 2022, it has 15.6 million customers and covers 99% of the national territory.\n\nAs far as Davivienda is concerned, we continue to ratify our position in Colombia's Digital Banking and we have become a Latin American benchmark with the most complete mobile offer in the country. Customers can purchase and manage savings, credit, investment, insurance and they can pay for their products through mobile banking. Thinking about their safety and comfort, Davivienda has accelerated the processes to continue providing our clients with friendly and simple experiences in the most important moments of their lives, such as buying their vehicle or the home of their dreams, without leaving home.\n\n## Risks associated with the use of technologies in digital ecosystems\n\nThe risk is related to the use of technology and the increase in connectivity between the technological infrastructure of companies and that of their Third Parties and Allies. This is also accompanied by the expansion of ecosystems for the provision of digital services to our customers. It also involves the concentration of services in digital channels that could have an impact on possible failures in the provision of digital services to customers that may result in regulatory and reputational sanctions.\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we have promoted the implementation of robust schemes for the management of new threats and emerging risk vectors. In order to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and availability of information, as well as the privacy of customer and user information, we are constantly evaluating the effectiveness of the control and security schemes, quickly incorporating the necessary controls and adjustments.\n\nOn the other hand, we have mitigated the risk of digital concentration with cloud deployments or different types of technological infrastructure. In a complementary manner, we have structured monitoring activities and controls over the technologies made available by the different cloud providers, both in infrastructure and software, maintaining the criteria of availability, performance, functionality, reliability and regulatory compliance.\n\nAdditionally, in view of the accelerated expansion of digital services, the Bank maintains its technological contingency and business continuity strategies updated, enabling Multi Zone and Multi Region services to attend minor and catastrophic situations in case there is a failure in the cloud. The services are deployed using different cloud providers and in case of failures in the Onpremise infrastructure, there is a main Data Center located in Bogota, and another Alternate Data Center in the city of Medell\u00edn. They allow us to recover the technology services to guarantee the provision of the services provided by the Bank.",

This instability establishes a new scenario of tensions that affect the dynamics of organizations. At the local level, we have seen that this risk has been increasing mainly due to internal conflicts and social protests, capable of creating scenarios of confusion, deception and disinformation that can affect organizations, mainly those that make up the critical cybernetic infrastructure of the countries and within which the Bank is part. The materialization of this type of attack brings serious consequences at the level of the operation, the availability of computer systems, service channels, and leakage or improper access to sensitive Bank information.\n\nIn the same way, this risk of cyber conflicts can affect public or private sector entities commercially related to the Bank (such as affiliates, subsidiaries, business partners, suppliers and other stakeholders), exposing their data and financial assets to scenarios of unavailability, loss or non-consensual transfers. To counteract this, the Bank has strengthened our security mechanisms in order to mitigate the occurrence of this type of attack that may affect our corporate clients.\n\nThe main impacts that could be generated by the materialization of the risk, which are as follows:\n\n-   Adverse e/ffects on the brand (reputational risk).\n-   Possible depreciation of the value of intellectual property.\n-   Higher operational expenses for the prevention of future attacks, containment and recovery against materialized threats.\n-   Possible impact on premiums to insure against future events.\n-   Regulatory sanctions and /fines for regulatory noncompliance.\n-   Materialization of technological fraud towards our clients.\n-   Commitment of sensitive information.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we continue strengthening the strategy, deepening and developing different roles in the organization in order to prevent, protect, detect and recover from any event that we are forced to face in a timely manner. We have also adopted and implemented new procedures, methodologies and tools that allow us to manage this type of risk.\n\nDuring 2022, we undertook the following efforts to manage this risk:\n\n-   Adoption of best practices in Cybersecurity and Information Security to improve the processes that support the strategy.\n-   Attention and response to the di/fferent requirements of regulatory entities in aspects concerning Information Security and Cybersecurity with remarkable management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n-   We actively participate in the di/fferent work groups of our sector with government entities for risk mitigation.\n-   We participate in cyber attack drills to strengthen response capabilities when facing this type of event.\n-   We started the execution of internal drills to strengthen the response and crisis management processes for this type of event.\n-   We trained and updated most of our employees using tools that allow us to promulgate and promote correct behavior in the face of possible social engineering and cybersecurity events.\n-   We strengthened internal controls to identify early deviations in the prevention, protection, response, and recovery processes in the event of cyber con/flict risks.",

Our Code of Ethics contains the statement of ethics, desirable conduct, unacceptable conduct, statement of responsibilities, fraud and anti-corruption issues, commitments, among others.\n\n## Transparency line\n\nIn 2022, 260 cases were received through the Transparency Line, which were managed within the times defined by the organization in accordance with the typologies presented. 70% of the cases received in 2022 were through the telephone channel. Additionally, from November 2022 the scope of the transparency line is extended to Suppliers.\n\n57% of the cases received were closed with Corrective Actions, which required an action plan and follow-up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consequently the Shareholders' Meeting con/firmed the seven members of the Board of Directors for the period 2022-2023 and allocation of resources for their management period.\n-   With regards to the Reform of the Bylaws, the reform of Articles 32, 35 and 36 was approved, to make them consistent with the Bylaws reform approved by the Shareholders' Meeting last year.\n\nThe different matters submitted for consideration by the General Shareholders' Meeting were unanimously approved by the attendees.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nThe Board of Directors determines the Bank's strategy and orientation. They also monitor and follow up the strategy execution. Both the Board of Directors and the Senior Management are aware of the Bank's risk positions; consequently, they actively intervene in their management, defining the measurement methodologies that identify the exposure by product, as well as the policies, profiles and limits.\n\nAs a result of the resignations submitted by Javier Suarez Esparragoza and Daniel Cortes McAllister as members of the Board of Directors to undertake positions in the Senior Management of the organization, the General Shareholders' Meeting of March 23, 2022, elected the Board of Directors of Banco Davivienda for the period from March 2022 to March 2023, composed only of principal members, in accordance with the Bylaws reform approved in said Meeting that modified the composition of the Board of Directors.\n\nBefore the Shareholders' Meeting was held, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee carried out the evaluation of the suitability, profile and validation of the disabilities and incompatibilities of the candidates to hold the position of members of the Board of Directors.",

These criteria are the following:\n\n'A. National Standards: To determine the independence of the members of the Board of Directors, Davivienda S.A. accepts the criteria established in article 44 of law 964 of 2005, namely: 'independent shall be understood as a person who in no case is:\n\n- 1. Employee or o/fficer of the Banco de la Republica or of any of its a/ffiliates, subsidiaries or controlling companies, including those persons who have had such capacity during the year immediately prior to the appointment, except in the case of the re-election of an independent person.\n- 2. Shareholders who directly or by virtue of an agreement lead, guide or control the majority of the voting rights of the organization or who determine the majority composition of the administrative, management or control bodies of the organization.\n- 3. Partner or employee of associations or companies that provide advisory or consulting services to the Banco de la Republica or to the companies that belong to the same economic group of which they are part, when the income for such a concept represents for them twenty percent (20%) or more of their operational income.\n- 4. Employee or director of a foundation, association or corporation that receives important donations from the Banco de la Republica. Signi/ficant donations are considered to be those that represent more than twenty percent (20%) of the total donations received by the respective institution.\n- 5. Administrator of an entity in whose board of directors a legal representative of the Banco de la Republica participates.\n- 6. A person who receives from the Banco de la Republica any remuneration other than fees as a member of the board of directors, the auditing committee or any other committee created by the board of directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Normative compliance\n\nDavivienda complies with the percentage of independence required by article 44 of Law 964 of 2005, regarding the composition of its Board of Directors.\n\nB. International Standards: Additionally, to determine the independence of the members of the Board of Directors, Banco Davivienda S.A. has adopted as the Corporate Governance best practice the international independence criteria of the Security Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nOver and above that, Banco Davivienda will analyze that the candidates to become part of the Board of Directors as independent members, have not been employees or directors of the Company or any of the Companies that make up Grupo Bol\u00edvar during the two years immediately prior to their appointment.'\n\nDavivienda complies with the percentage of independence required by article 44 of Law 964 of 2005, which establishes that 'at least twenty-five percent (25%) must be independent members.'\n\nBanco Davivienda S.A. has defined as a Best Corporate Governance practice that its Board of Directors has a higher percentage of participation of independent members. Today, the composition of the Board of Directors of Banco Davivienda is as follows: 71% of its members are independent and two (02) are women, and the average tenure of the main members of the Board of Directors in 2022 is 6.8 years.\n\n## Information on attendance at Board of Directors meetings\n\nThe average percentage of attendance by the members of the Board of Directors at the meetings held in 2022 was 78%.

Especially the regulations that seek to deal with the economic effects after the end of the COVID-19 pandemics and the main reform proposals of the new Government, such as the filing and approval of the Tax Reform and the 'Total Peace' law.\n\nOn the first issue, due to the change in the behavior of household consumption, the high levels of inflation and interest rates, an increase in credit risk indicators was observed that led the Financial Superintendency of Colombia (SFC) to adopt measures to recognize the potential impact of the payment capacity of the debtors. In this regard, instructions were issued aimed at making additional general provisions.\n\nIn addition to the above, the implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NFR) issued by the SFC in 2019 (whose transition ends in March 2023) implied an additional challenge due to the increase in rates and the reduction in funding sources. Likewise, regulations were issued to tackle issues such as\n\n-   To Identi/fication and management of large exposures and risk concentration of credit institutions.\n-   To Supervision in environmental matters.\n-   To Knowledge of the end bene/ficiaries, both for tax purposes and for the prevention of ML/TF risks.\n-   To Management of the Financial Consumer Ombudsman\n-   To Disclosure of information from issuers of securities, among other aspects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this sense, we invest in state-of-the-art technologies, such as the cloud, automation and analytics. They allow us to scale our operations and reduce costs in an efficient manner, offering faster, more personalized and secure services. We are also adopting agile methodologies and DevOps to improve collaboration and speed in the development and implementation of technology projects.\n\n## Davivienda, a disruptive technology player\n\nWe are leaders in the adoption of digital and disruptive trends. Therefore, we continue to explore new technologies such as blockchain, internet of things, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, among others, in order to find innovative ways to solve traditional operations and transactions, as well as to build new products and services. In this regard, some of the projects we are executing include the development of an ecosystem that allows us to offer money transfers with other financial institutions, the issuance of private bonds, and friendly and reliable services that allow customers to manage their products from their mobile devices.\n\n## Evolution towards the cloud and implementation of ecosystems with digital talent\n\nAs a fundamental element of our digital transformation, and as part of our Banking as a Service and Open Banking strategy, we have trained more than 450 employees in cloud\n\ntechnologies. This has allowed us to connect with more than 40 allies. We have also implemented new functionalities in our core accounts. That has facilitated the digital transformation of services and has allowed the execution of our FinOps strategy for cost management and optimization. As a result, we have been able to reduce our annual cloud consumption expenditure by 13%.\n\nIn addition, we have initiated the formation of our internal digital factory to accelerate the construction of digital assets and strengthen our service and product offerings. As a result, we have implemented 67 new initiatives. This translates into an increase of 21% compared to the previous year. All this has generated an efficiency of COP 1.4 billion and has allowed more than 80% of our clients to link using our digital channels.\n\n## Evolution of the analytical ecosystem\n\nOver the past year, our bank has made significant progress in modernizing our data analytics technology. This has allowed us to significantly improve our efficiency and availability. We have migrated to cloud-native platforms, which has given us greater flexibility and scalability. In addition to that, we have deepened our use of analytics to develop specific solutions to improve the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, reduce credit risk and detect potential fraud.\n\nWe have also implemented solutions to improve operational and accounting reconciliation and consolidation, which has allowed us to have a more complete and accurate view of our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We continue to modernize our systems\n\nWe are strategically and consistently undertaking the modernization of our technology. This involves reducing obsolescence and adopting a new-generation technology stack. However, this transformation brings along significant challenges, such as the integration of different systems and computing platforms.",

These changes have enabled us to improve our efficiency, customize our services and products, and generate a set of reusable digital assets. We are implementing a technology strategy that will enable us to modernize our Organization in a comprehensive and sustainable manner, and we are confident that the results of this transformation will enable us to continue improving our customers' experience and consolidate our market leadership.\n\n## Our technology operation is more resilient\n\nDuring the past year, we managed to make significant progress in our disaster recovery strategy. In this regard, we moved our contingency data center to the city of Medellin. That has given us greater capacity and geographic diversity to respond to events that could affect our operations. We also relocated part of our team to operate from that city. Thanks to these efforts, we have increased the maturity of our resilience strategy and are committed to continue strengthening our capabilities to offer our customers the best possible quality of service in any situation.\n\n## Secure customers and transactions\n\nOur goal is to stay one step ahead in fraud detection and prevention, and to do so, we face increasingly sophisticated challenges. In this regard, the implementation of advanced detection systems in digital and face-to-face channels allows us to respond effectively to these threats, while providing us with a competitive advantage by protecting the Bank's\n\nassets and reducing the risk of losses caused by third parties. We are committed to continue improving our capabilities and we are confident that these efforts will enable us to provide a safer and more reliable service to our customers.\n\n## At Davivienda, we understand the growing importance of data security and cybersecurity\n\nThat is why we have implemented a new cybersecurity operations model. This model includes capabilities for continuous verification of the validity and strength of our controls to deal with increasingly sophisticated cyberpunks. In addition to that, we are using real-time data analytics to identify advanced threats (threat hunting) and we employ artificial intelligence to predict which of these threats represent a real risk.\n\nDuring 2022, we executed cybersecurity projects that have adopted exponential technologies, such as hyper-automation and threat identification based on behavioral analysis. All this has allowed us to make security an essential and organic component of our services. Thanks to these advances, Davivienda is always one step ahead in the detection and prevention of cyber threats, guaranteeing the security and privacy of our clients' and the organization's information.\n\n## Evolution of tools to provide customer support\n\nThroughout 2022, we have carried out a modernization of our interaction tools to get closer to our customers and offer them a high-quality omnichannel experience. To achieve this, we have implemented a number of key initiatives. First, we unified our voice, chat and social media platforms. All\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthis allowed us to have a more integrated and consistent presence across all customer service channels, facilitating customer communication at any time and from any location. In addition, we have incorporated the ability to analyze interactions, which provides us with valuable information about our customers' needs, expectations and desires. Finally, the integration with bots allows us to offer a 'Bot First' experience in all our interactions, regardless of the channel used. This allows us to provide a quick and efficient response to customers' questions and needs, improving their overall experience.\n\n## Performance based on efficient practices\n\nIt is important to note that all of the above would not have been possible at all without efficient project management, and to accomplish this, we have incorporated an agile work culture. Our project management process begins with the identification, ranking and prioritization of projects based on the value provided to the business. Next, we perform a robust assessment of the technological impacts, the resources (human and budget) required, ensuring their availability.\n\nFinally, we focus on a successful implementation of the different technologies in production. As a result, we have been able to increase the delivery rate of technologybased solutions by more than 60%. We are committed to maintaining an efficient project management and agile work culture that allows us to implement technologies effectively to constantly improve our processes. We are confident that this will enable us to continue providing innovative solutions to our customers and consolidate our market leadership.",

The World Bank forecast early in 2022 expected the world economy to grow at a 4.1% annual rate. However, a year later, its growth estimate was reduced to 2.9% 40 . Nevertheless, despite this downward adjustment for the global economy, growth estimates for Latin America increased from 2.6% at the beginning of the year to 3.6%. Global growth projections deteriorated because inflation rose more than expected, prompting tighter monetary policies in most countries around the world. The adverse effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions have also played a significant role.\n\nOil prices continued to rebound throughout the year, due to global economic growth but, above all, to a less accommodating policy by OPEC countries and as a consequence of the crude oil shortage generated by the international conflict. On average, Brent benchmark crude oil prices reached USD 92.4 per barrel, well above the figure recorded in 2021 (USD 70.8), and significantly higher than the 2020 price (USD 41.9) 41 .\n\n- 39 Document prepared by the Executive Directorate of Economic Studies, with information available as of January 18, 2022\n- 40 See Global Economic Perspectives, World Bank, January 2023\n- 41 Data taken from the St. Louis Federal Reserve, FRED.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It revises the rate for higher income individuals and establishes a new wealth tax.\n- \ufffd It modi/fies industry-speci/fic bene/fits and introduces a surtax on income tax for companies operating in the oil, gas and coal industries.\n- \ufffd Introduces consumption taxes on sugary foods, ultra-processed foods and single-use plastics, to be implemented on a phased basis.\n\n## EXCHANGE RATE\n\nIn 2022, Latin American currencies were subject to substantial pressure exerted by several factors, including: the appreciation of the USD internationally and worsening fiscal conditions in certain countries. Political events also played an important role in a number of countries, such as the results of the referendum on the new constitution in Chile and the election of President Lula for the third time in Brazil.\n\nThe Colombian currency depreciated sharply in 2022, by 20.8%, from 3,981.2 COP per 1 USD at the beginning of the year to COP 4,810.2 on the last day. This is attributable to an increased country risk, as well as to the strong appreciation of the USD worldwide following interest rate hikes in the United States. 10-year CDS levels averaged 343 points over the year, considerably higher than the 202 points recorded the previous year. Additionally, increased country risk was associated, among other factors, with the uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new administration; the risk premium decreased only at the end of the year, following the approval of the tax reform and a decrease in global risk aversion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEven though in 2022 there was a net inflow of foreign portfolio investment amounting to approximately 1,749 million USD, portfolio capital outflows from Colombian investors abroad amounted to 864 million USD. Consequently, foreign capital inflows contributed to ease the pressure on the foreign exchange market.\n\n## Exchange rate\n\n(Colombian pesos per US dollar)\n\nSource: Superintendencia Financiera\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Exchange Rate: COP 4,810.20\n\nAs of December 2022.

Exports totaled 57.1 billion USD and grew by 38% compared to 2021. This performance was driven by an increase in international oil prices, a rise in food prices and the currency exchange rate depreciation.In terms of products, external sales of fuels amounted to 32 billion USD, growing by 61.4% year-on-year and accounting for the largest share of total exports, i.e. 56.1%. Agriculture, food, and beverage exports ranked second, amounting to 11.5 billion USD and growing by 22.5%, followed by manufacturing exports, amounting to 10.5 billion USD, growing by 17.7%.\n\nOn the other hand, based on provisional figures published by DIAN for December, imports in 2022 totaled 77.2 billion USD, growing by 26.4%, mainly driven by foreign purchases of fuels and manufactured goods such as vehicles and other transportation equipment. Imports of raw materials and intermediate goods amounted to 38.6 billion USD and increased by 31.6% compared to 2021. Imports of capital goods and consumer goods totaled 22.8 billion USD and 15.8 billion USD, growing by 31.6% and 16.9%, respectively.\n\nAccordingly, from January to November 2022, the trade deficit 43 of the Colombian economy totaled USD -14.2 billion USD, compared to a -15.2 billion USD recorded the year before.\n\n## FINANCIAL INDUSTRY\n\n## Financial Systems / Gross Loans\n\nNominal annual variation MA(4)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Superintendencia Financiera\n\nAs of October 2022, the profitability of the financial system, measured by return on assets (ROA) 44 and return on equity (ROE) 45 , stood at 2.1% and 16.1%, respectively. This is explained by the dynamism of the loan portfolio, especially in the consumer segment, combined with positive loan performance indicators and moderate provisioning expenses, which led to higher profits for the financial system.\n\nOver the first months of the year, our loan portfolio grew, driven by solid domestic demand and a strong\n\ndomestic economy.

Between December 15, 2021 and October 27, 2022, the rate went up from 0.75% to 9% (825 basis points).\n\nThe Central Bank argued that these hikes were justified on the grounds of persistent inflationary pressures arising from the prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine, its impact on international commodity prices; rising domestic producer prices and their potential spillover to consumer prices; and the upward trend in inflation expectations.\n\n## Costa Rica / Nominal exchange rate\n\nSource: Central Bank of Costa Rica\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5 billion USD in Eurobonds\n\nThe Government secured legislative approval to issue and  place these funds in the /first quarter.\n\nOn the other hand, the Government of Costa Rica reported a primary surplus amounting to 2.3% of GDP for the cumulative period from January to November 2022 (0.2% of GDP in the same period of 2021). Likewise, the financial balance was reduced by half, from 4.1% of GDP in 2021 to 2% of GDP one year later.\n\nThe Government of Costa Rica obtained the third disbursement amounting to 270 million USD under the Extended Fund Facility Agreement (EFF) entered into with the IMF. This agreement was negotiated for a total 1.7 billion USD, including 848 million USD (48%) that had already been disbursed to the country.\n\nAdditionally, the Government secured legislative approval to issue 5 billion USD in Eurobonds. According to the Ministry of Finance, the goal is to engage consulting firms by mid-February 2023 and, thereafter, wait for a window of opportunity to place these funds (USD 1.5 billion) in the first quarter.\n\nAccordingly, Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's maintained the country's risk rating at B,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nB2 and B, respectively, while Fitch and S&P upgraded the outlook from negative to stable in March 2022.\n\n## Financial Industry\n\nThe Central Bank noted in its Annual Financial Stability Report that throughout 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 the banking system was significantly exposed to various financial risks stemming from the health emergency. However, these risks have been partially mitigated and, overall, banks maintained adequate levels of liquidity and capital adequacy in line with regulatory thresholds. This scenario was primarily enabled by measures to loosen prudential regulations, a countercyclical monetary policy adopted by the Central Bank, and recovering economic activity and employment.\n\nRegarding the main monetary aggregates, despite higher lending interest rates, outstanding loans increased by 5.9% compared to 2.3% a year earlier, driven mainly by buoyant operations in local currency.\n\nOn the other hand, total liquidity has continued to moderate, reflecting diminished uncertainty following the effects of the pandemic. By the end of 2022, this indicator posted a 4.3% annual increase, significantly lower than the 5.9% recorded a year earlier. Likewise, higher interest rates contribute to incentivizing savings in local currency, which in turn led to fewer savings in dollars.",

Interest rates have remained stable, reflecting the prevailing liquidity conditions and the funding structure that relies on deposits.\n\nHowever, the Central Reserve Bank noted certain risks to financial stability during 2021 and 2022, stemming from high and persistent inflation, as well as the loss of economic momentum due to the economic downturn of major trading partners, mainly the U.S. and Central America.\n\nThe report argues that the performance of financial institutions and the main markets suggests that the effects and ensuing risks that emerged as a result of the health crisis have gradually diminished, enabling the financial system to build up autonomous\n\nequity and achieve higher returns, strengthening the financial system's resilience. Although there are no immediate risks looming for the financial system as of the second half of 2022, a low-growth international economic outlook and its potential effects on the domestic economy create an aggregate of factors that should be monitored.\n\nRegarding the main monetary aggregates, the outstanding balance of the domestic financial system's loan portfolio grew by 10.8% year-on-year (7.2% the previous year), driven mainly by business loans, reflecting higher investments in productive activities.\n\nFurthermore, total liquidity, defined as total financial assets at the disposal of the economy issued by the Financial System, both monetary and quasimonetary, has regained dynamism. At the end of 2022, the indicator posted a 4.7% year-on-year increase, higher than the 2.5% figure recorded a year earlier.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## El Salvador/ Main financial sector figures and indicators\n\n(Figures in USD billions, except percentages)\n\n|                                       | AMOUNT   | AMOUNT   | AMOUNT   | VARIATION /parenleft.cap1/parenright.cap   | VARIATION /parenleft.cap1/parenright.cap   |\n|---------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|                                       | Dec. 20  | Dec. 21  | Dec. 22  | 2022-2021                                  | 2021-2020                                  |\n| Total assets                          | 23,211   | 24,246   | 25,057   | 3.3%                                       | 4.5%                                       |\n| Investments                           | 3,092    | 2,988    | 3,140    | 5.1%                                       | -3.4%                                      |\n| Overall loans                         | 14,386   | 15,422   | 17,087   | 10.8%                                      | 7. 2%                                      |\n| Commercial *                          | 7,068    | 7,701    | 8,896    | 5.8%                                       | 9.0%                                       |\n| Consumer *                            | 5,123    | 5,388    | 5,850    | -2.6%                                      | 5.2%                                       |\n| Mortgage *                            | 2,651    | 2,759    | 2,827    | -3.5%                                      | 4.0%                                       |\n| Other assets **                       | 5,733    | 5,835    | 4,830    | -17. 2%                                    | 1.8%                                       |\n| Liabilities                           | 20,083   | 20,756   | 21,560   | 3.9%                                       | 3.4%                                       |\n| Term deposits                         | 6,443    | 6,176    | 6,507    | 5.4%                                       | - 4.1%                                     |\n| Savings                               | 4,703    | 5,172    | 5,697    | 10.2%                                      | 10.0%                                      |\n| Other liabilities ***                 | 3,324    | 3,588    | 3,755    | 4.7%                                       | 7.9%                                       |\n| Securities                            | 833      | 835      | 858      | 2.8%                                       | 0.2%                                       |\n| Checking accounts                     | 4,779    | 4,985    | 4,743    | -4.9%                                      | 4.3%                                       |\n| Equity                                | 2,575    | 2,834    | 2,936    | 3.6%                                       | 10.1%                                      |\n| Future commitments  and contingencies | 554      | 656      | 561      | -14.4                                      | 18.4%                                      |\n| ROA (2)                               | 0.68%    | 1.22%    | 1.38%    |                                            |                                            |\n| ROE (3)                               | 6.48%    | 10.92%   | 12.49%   |                                            |                                            |\n\nSource: Financial System Superintendence of El Salvador (SSF).",

External factors such as high fuel prices, which reached record highs, coupled with moderate growth in the United States, contributed to slowing growth.\n\nFinancial intermediation, commerce, and the manufacturing industry contributed the most to the GDP in 2022, due to higher intermediation margins in the financial system. Textile production stood out in the manufacturing industry, driven by growing demand from the United States. However, food production was adversely impacted by competition from imported products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Throughout the year, annual inflation rates reached their highest levels since 2010, peaking in April, driven by the war between Ukraine and Russia, which has led to an increase in fuel costs in international markets and shortages in several raw materials. This has triggered an increase in the prices of the main products that make up the basic food basket and transportation.\n\n## Exchange Rate\n\n## Honduras / Inflation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Central Bank of Honduras\n\nThe Honduran lempira displayed a stable trend against the US dollar during 2022. This is explained by remittances, which increased by 21% year-on-year as of September 2022, compared to a 33% year-on-year growth recorded a year earlier. Remittances account for nearly 20% of the country's GDP.\n\nOther factors that explain the evolution of the exchange rate include a 21% increase in the goods and services account deficit (17% of GDP), a 3% decrease in international reserves, and changes in the parameters used by the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH) to establish the reference exchange rate.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This sharp decrease in annual inflation was caused by price control measures implemented in the middle of the year on 72 basic household products, medicines, and fuels.\n\n## Fiscal Policy and Risk Rating\n\nThe Central Government 's fiscal deficit amounted to 5.89% of GDP in the year to September 2022. The deficit decreased compared to the figure reported for the same period a year earlier (-7.45%). This improvement reflects a 9.3% increase in total revenues, favored by a 23.4% increase in direct tax revenues. Meanwhile, total expenditures fell 3% YoY as of September, primarily on account of a 3.2% reduction in transfers and a 12.1% reduction in debt interest expenses. Capital spending remained relatively flat compared to 2021, registering a 0.03% reduction. Public debt as a proportion of GDP went down to 56.4% from 57.35% over the year.\n\nFinally, Fitch Ratings changed Panama's credit rating outlook (BBB-) from negative to stable in January 2022. According to Fitch, this decision was prompted by fiscal improvements and a better-than-expected economic recovery. Later in the year, in October, Moody's gave a negative outlook to Panama's credit rating (Baa2). According to the rating agency, this decision was triggered by the rigidity of the public expenditure structure and the financial deterioration of the social security system. Standard & Poor's rating remained at BBB with a negative outlook through 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT\n\nThe figures herein refer to the consolidated results achieved in 2022 in comparison with the results recorded in 2021, under IFRS accounting principles for both periods.\n\n## ASSETS ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURE\n\nAt the end of the year, assets totaled COP 184.1 trillion, growing by 20.6% compared to 2021, mainly driven by gross loans, which grew by COP 26.2 trillion (22.1% annual increase), mainly due to the behavior in the commercial and consumer portfolios, which grew by 20.1% and 28.2%, respectively. Our mortgage portfolio grew by 18.5% over the year. As of December 2022, gross loans accounted for 78.6% of the Bank's total Assets.\n\nCash and interbank funds amounted to COP 16.3 trillion, growing by 5.6%, mainly in Central America, as the exchange rate effect led to a COP 3 trillion increase. Our investment portfolio grew by 17.4%, explained by the increased valuation of our debt investment portfolio in Colombia and the exchange rate effect in Central America.\n\nCommercial loans grew by 20.1%, mainly explained by corporate demand. The exchange rate effect had a significant impact, accounting for 7.2 percentage points of yearly growth.\n\nConsumer loans increased by 28.2%, mainly due to demand for unsecured personal loans, credit cards, and payroll loans throughout the year.\n\nThe mortgage portfolio grew by 22.1%, mainly explained by traditional mortgages, low-income housing, and residential leasing, particularly in Colombia, aligned with sector dynamics and Government subsidy programs.\n\nAs of December 2022, 90-days PDL closed at 3.13%, 22 basis points lower than the previous year, in line with portfolio growth, improved customer payment behavior, and write-offs made throughout the year.\n\nThe PDL ratio for the commercial portfolio decreased by 77 basis points over the year, reflecting improved customer payment behavior and, to a lower extent, write-offs throughout the year.\n\nThe PDL ratio for the consumer portfolio increased by 104 basis points over the year, as high interest rates affected customer payment capacity, and the change in this portfolio's risk profile in Colombia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Davivienda Consolidated Figures / Assets\n\n(Figures in COP trillion)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amid a context marked by rising global inflation and a generalized contractionary monetary policy to control it, funding costs increased becoming difficult to obtain across all economies. In Colombia specifically, this was exacerbated by the competition in raising term funds to comply with the new long-term liquidity indicator NSFR (CFEN).\n\nThese conditions reduced excess liquidity, leading to various measures being adopted to rebuild target liquidity levels, including: increasing term deposits in stable segments, individuals, and companies; and securing structural funding through long term loans.\n\nThis situation did not represent a material issue for any of our companies, throughout the year Davienda and all of its subsidiaries complied sufficiently with regulatory short and long term liquidity ratios.",

On the other hand, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (CFEN), designed to ensure that entities have sufficient stable funding to support their long-term assets, averaged 103.7% throughout the year, showing an average 3.3 trillion COP positive gap.\n\nAdditionally, all subsidiaries maintained an adequate and stable liquidity position throughout the year, thereby complying proficiently with both internal and regulatory indicators.\n\n## Davivienda / Average Liquidity Ratio Compliance for 2022\n\n|             | SHORT TERM RATIO   | SHORT TERM RATIO   | LONG TERM RATIO   | LONG TERM RATIO   |\n|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|             | Compliance         | Limit              | Compliance        | Limit             |\n| Costa Rica  | 1.21               | >1                 | 1.14              | >1                |\n| El Salvador | 1.62               | >1                 | 1.16              | >1                |\n| Honduras    | 1.51               | >1                 | 1.18              | >1                |\n| Panam\u00e1      | 1.61               | >1                 | 1.29              | >1                |\n\nFinally, the Consolidated Exposure Indicator-IEC, established by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia to measure the short-term liquidity risk of the consolidated balance sheet, recorded an average 909 million USD positive gap.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\nAs of December 2022, the Bank's consolidated profits totaled COP 1.62 trillion, growing by 28.1% over the previous year. This performance is mainly attributable to an increase in loan income, the lower relative cost of risk over the year, and higher non-financial income throughout the year. At the end of 2022, the 12-month ROAE was 10.7%, increasing by 139 basis points over the previous year.\n\nThe accumulated gross financial margin as of December 2022 was approximately 8.9 trillion COP, growing by 18.3% over the year. This performance is mainly attributable to a 5.3 trillion COP growth of financial income, relative to financial expenses, which grew by 3.9 trillion COP.\n\nLoan income rose by 49.1% over the year, due to income growth across our loan portfolio, consumer loans (2.1 trillion COP; +51.2%), commercial loans (1.9 trillion COP, +60.7%), and mortgage loans (0.9 trillion COP, +32.8%), aligned with portfolio growth dynamics during the year.\n\nThe 12-month NIM closed at 6.04%, growing by 10 basis points compared to the figure recorded last year, as the growth of the gross financial margin outpaced the growth of productive assets. On the other hand, when including income from\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexchanges and derivatives to reflect the results of our hedging strategy, the NIM closed at 6.23%, decreasing by 10 basis points over the year.\n\nProvision expenses (net of recoveries) as of December 2022 totaled 3.4 trillion COP, growing by 4.4% compared to the accumulated figure recorded last year. This reflects the challenging economic environment during the second half of the year and potentially complex credit risk dynamics during 2023 which could impact our customer's payment behavior.\n\nAccumulated operating income as of December 2022 increased by 9.4% compared to 2021, following higher income from debit and credit card fees, after these products experienced higher transactional volumes, and insurance placement fees.\n\nAccumulated operating expenses as of December 2022 totaled 5.2 trillion COP, growing by 16.6% relative to the accumulated figure recorded in December 2021. This result was impacted by the exchange rate, inflation, and salary increases in Colombia. The COP depreciation accounted for approximately 340 basis points of this increase in accumulated operating expenses.",

This performance is mainly attributable to portfolio growth and write-offs throughout the year.\n\nOur investment portfolio reached 17.8 trillion COP, growing by 18.3% compared to December 2021. Cash and interbank funds decreased by 12.9% due to market volatility, mainly seen in the exchange rate.\n\nIn 2022, we remained the second largest bank in Colombia in terms of gross loans. As of December, our market share was 16.2% 46\n\nOur retail banking portfolio grew by 21.8%. Consumer loans posted the highest growth, 25.7% compared to the previous year, as demand for unsecured personal loans, credit cards, and payroll loans increased through our digital platforms.\n\nOur mortgage portfolio grew by 17.5% over the past year, mainly concentrated in traditional housing, lowincome housing, and residential leasing.\n\n## Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 46 Information reported by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia.\n- 47 Includes securitized portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe remain the leading bank in Colombia in the placement of mortgage loans, with a market share of approximately 26.5% 47 in the financial system as of December. This means that Davivienda helped 1 out of every 4 Colombian families finance their dream of having their own home, through mortgage loans or residential leasing.\n\nFurthermore, we have actively participated in housing subsidy programs granted by the National Government to middle and low-income families.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This result represented a 141 basis point decrease, explained by dividend distribution, which represented a distribution of 41.15% of 2021's profits, Risk-Weighted Asset growth, in line with the growth of consumer and commercial loans, and the regulatory change in one of the operational value at risk parameters.\n\nThe total capital adequacy ratio decreased by 213 basis points, closing at 19.91%, mainly due to:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COP 14.5 trillion\n\nBanco Davivienda's equity as of December 2022, growing 12.9% compared to 2021.\n\n- \ufffd Dividend distribution.\n- \ufffd An increase of total Risk-Weighted Assets, in line with the growth of consumer and commercial loans.\n- \ufffd A change in one of the operational value at risk parameters.\n- \ufffd A lower weight of subordinated debt.\n- \ufffd The maturity of Tier 2 bonds totaling 500 million USD.\n\nHowever, the Bank's capital adequacy ratio is well above percentages required by the regulator.\n\n## Equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LIQUIDITY\n\n2022 was marked by a number of challenges for the Bank's liquidity management:\n\n- \ufffd Widespread interest rate hikes around the world caused an increase in funding costs which in turn made it more di/fficult to obtain. Particularly in Colombia, the 900 basis point interest rate increase by the Central Bank, together with increased competition in the /financial sector to obtain term funding in order to comply with the new long term liquidity indicator, NSFR (CFEN).\n- \ufffd The environment characterized by political uncertainty and seemingly entrenched in/flation expectations, led to a low investor appetite towards the bond market.\n- \ufffd Accelerated growth in the consumer portfolio during the /first half of the year\n\nThese conditions exerted pressure on both short and long term liquidity ratios. Consequently, various measures were adopted to rebuild target liquidity levels, such as increasing term deposits in stable segments, individuals, and companies; and securing structural funding through loans granted by multilateral banks.\n\nHowever, this situation did not represent a material issue for the Bank, we complied sufficiently with all regulatory liquidity requirements, which were sufficiently fulfilled throughout 2022. For Banco Davivienda, the Liquidity Risk Indicator-IRL, which measures the amount of liquid assets versus liquidity needs in a 30-day horizon, exceeded liquidity needs by an average of 146 times. Meanwhile, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (CFEN), designed to ensure that entities have sufficient stable funding to support their long-term assets, averaged 103.7% throughout the year.",

Consequently, ROAE closed at 8.48%.\n\nThe performance of accumulated profits is attributable to higher provision and financial expenses, due to high interest rates in Colombia, together with an increase in operating expenses.\n\nInterest income increased by 57.6% compared to 2021. Loan interest income grew by 57.3%, mainly due to increased demand and high interest rates, in addition to consumer loans increasing their share within our portfolio.\n\nThe accumulated investment income reached 228.4 billion COP at the end of 2022, growing by 302.9% over the previous year. This performance is attributable to the debt investment portfolio as our sovereign debt investments appreciated over the year.\n\nFinancial expenses grew by 156.8% compared to the accumulated figure recorded in 2021, mainly due to high interest rates throughout the year.\n\nAs the growth of interest income outpaced financial expenses, the gross financial margin as of December 2022 increased by 18.6% compared to the accumulated figure recorded in 2021, amounting to 6.78 trillion COP.\n\nProvision expenses grew by 805 billion COP (29.3%) over the year, reaching 3.55 trillion COP. This is attributable to the accelerated growth of the loan portfolio, in addition to high interest rates, which increases the probability of default by customers, mainly in the consumer segment. Consequently, the accumulated cost-of-risk closed at 3.31%, a 0.29 percentage point increase compared to the figure recorded in 2021 (3.02%).\n\nThe Bank's net financial margin grew by COP 257.8 billion over the year, expanding by 8.7%.\n\nOperating income increased by 13.0% mainly due to higher fee income as the volume of transactions increased and the reinstatement of certain fees, in addition to other factors.\n\nAccumulated operating expenses reached 3.8 trillion COP, growing by 15.0% compared to 2021, as administrative and personnel expenses increased, mainly due to benefits granted throughout the year. The 12 month efficiency ratio improved by 1.87 percentage points, going from 49.96% last year to 48.09% at the end of 2022.\n\nConsequently, accumulated profits before taxes reached 1.3 trillion COP in 2022, decreasing by 8.3% over the year.

However, this year was marked by global events such as a global economic slowdown, rising inflation that surged to multi-decade highs, and a significant increase in interest rates. Overall, markets declined in this context, pressured by risk aversion worldwide and low levels of liquidity locally. At year-end 2022, the MSCI COLCAP had contracted by 8.9%.\n\nThe Davivienda preferred share (PFDAVVNDA) fell by 13.3% throughout the year, reflecting global trends, ending the year with a market capitalization of 2.98 trillion pesos for our stocks traded on the stock exchange.

The volume of bond placements marketwide amounted to $2.49 trillion, 76% below the previous year. The low placement of this type of instruments was affected by the high uncertainty among market agents and the upward trend of interest rates.\n\nIn the primary market, there was an increase in the spread of private debt over public debt, which for AAA rated instruments reached 190 basis points and for AA+ rated instruments 400 basis points.\n\nIn the secondary market, in a generalized way and in line with the path of Banco de la Rep\u00fablica's intervention rate, valuation rates increased by more than 900 basis points.

That is why it is pivotal to join this global commitment.\n\nBanks support individuals, families, companies, businesses, and institutions as they make choices on what to buy, when to borrow, and how to invest, all of which directly impact our carbon footprint. We have therefore joined this important cultural transformation and we comprehensively manage our business accordingly.\n\nIn line with our higher purpose: 'enriching life with integrity' , climate change is at the core of our sustainable management approach. We have documented and leveraged actions undertaken throughout the years as we have deployed our strategy, supporting this approach. Davivienda issued its first TCFD report in December 2021, and we have continued moving forward towards achieving our goals by taking bold actions since then. This second report outlines our progress and describes how we engage with other stakeholders from society and the Government to help achieve the goal of maintaining global warming below 1.5\u00b0C - as set out in the Paris Agreement - and to achieve Net Zero by 2050.\n\nThe Governance chapter explains the Bank's governance practices and how the Board of Directors and our leadership spearhead our efforts to address climate change risks and opportunities. The Strategy chapter provides an overview of the potential risks that climate change poses to our business, our strategy, and our financial planning, as well as the opportunities that we may seize. The Risk Management chapter explains how we identify, assess, and manage climate change-related risks. Finally, the Metrics and Targets chapter presents our key indicators and targets for managing climate change across our organization. As such, we report our performance and our current and future commitments.\n\nLearn more about our efforts to address climate change and join us in our daily actions to face this great challenge that unites us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJAVIER JOS\u00c9 SU\u00c1REZ ESPARRAGOZA\n\nPresident\n\n1\n\nA\n\n4\n\n6\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

We enrich the lives of people and the planet by leveraging the transformative power of our business models, while securing our long-term presence, with accountability towards our stakeholders and environmental awareness, amidst a growing number of challenges affecting the financial industry. We conducted a materiality review in both 2021 and 2022, identifying 8 material issues that address the ESG dimensions of our strategy. Climate change stands out as the most relevant.\n\nWe are committed to sustainable development and conceive crises as opportunities to shatter paradigms and further take on the challenges associated with climate change faced by industries and the financial sector. We are committed to reducing CO 2 emissions throughout our operations, as well as in our lending practices by funding projects and activities aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change, and by adequately managing the potential negative impacts of climate change. We follow global best practices to address key issues for our organization and our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate change\n\nis the most important material subject within the ESG matters of our strategy.\n\nClimate change is highly relevant in our industry, as it may have direct financial consequences. It is also the source of important conversations around climate risks, whether physical or transition, prompting rapid strategic business decisions and moving funds towards activities aimed at transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Therefore, we adhered to the TCFD in 2020, submitted our first report in 2021 and are now sharing our second report, highlighting our progress in climate management. We are committed to actions geared towards meeting global needs in the years to come.\n\nDavivienda strives to manage climate change by reducing water and energy consumption, mitigating our carbon footprint, investing in green building projects, deploying non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) projects, adopting a circular economy approach, and promoting sustainability among our personnel. As part of the suite of products and services offered to our customers, since 2014 we have designed lines of credit with environmental benefits aimed at promoting climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts, raising awareness, and yielding positive business outcomes.\n\n## We strive to meet global standards and adopt best practices on climate change management .\n\nConsequently, since 2014 we have been reporting our climate performance via the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and we are part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Furthermore, in 2015 we were also included in the S&P Sustainability Yearbook, which acknowledges the top 15% companies with the best sustainability practices in the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is aimed at further identifying and prioritizing these risks in conjunction with our business and risk management areas, thereby raising awareness about these potential impacts, prioritizing such risks, and integrating pre-existing procedures and controls for mitigation purposes. For the Corporate and Business segments and other segments associated with the energy industry, we have prioritized risks arising from increased or decreased rainfall, whereas for the infrastructure sector, we have prioritized risks arising from climate events such as landslides and floods. These decisions will enable us to improve our response plan to address these risks using specific adaptation and mitigation measures appropriate to the context and location.\n\nBy identifying and managing climate change risks, both physical and transition, we are moving forward on our plans to mainstream these issues and assign accountability for mitigation, embedding these matters into our business strategy to inform decisions on various fronts, thereby preparing ourselves to face potential emerging risks, as well as to seize the opportunities.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION OF OPPORTUNITIES\n\n## Environmental products and programs - Green Lines\n\nMainstreaming climate change into our strategy has helped us to leverage new business, boost income, and reduce risks.

The analysis, lessons learned,\n\nand recommendations will help the industry to align its portfolios with the criteria laid out in Colombia's Green Taxonomy . This process may be replicated in other financial institutions across the country.\n\nWe strive to drive impact actions benefiting our customers and strengthening a culture grounded on knowledge for our employees.

This joint analysis conducted on strategies, business units, and implicit risks underscores how each unit involves various dimensions of risk and operational complexities.\n\nEach business cycle involves different dimensions, which are managed by specialized teams through risk verticals, responsible for comprehensively assessing strategic, technical, and operational risks. Similarly, across-the-board risk teams evaluate common risks, regardless of their origin, arising from business units underlying processes.\n\nSince 2021, climate change risk was added across-theboard to our overall risk management framework, in conjunction with the environmental and social risk management approach introduced in 2011, so as to integrate it into each of the main verticals.\n\n## General Framework\n\nERM\n\nHigher Purpose: Enrich Life with Integrity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperational Risks\n\nFraud Risk\n\nTechnology\n\nThird parties and allies\n\nBusiness Continuity\n\nCybersecurity\n\nAuthentication\n\nInformation Security\n\nInternal Fraud\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Climate Change Risks\n\nAssets and Liabilities Management\n\nReporting - Money Laundering Prevention Regulatory Compliance - Internal Control\n\n## Audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The consolidated results show that 99.5% of applications assessed for flood hazards were classified at medium and low levels, while 99.2% were classified at medium and low levels for mass landslide hazards, given their susceptibility to these events.\n\nIn 2022, beyond the mortgage portfolio, we broadened our scope to identify current physical risks due to flood and landslide threat levels, now covering the commercial portfolio, which includes Corporate, Business, SME, and Construction loans. As of December 2022, 70% of commercial loans had been georeferenced, thereby identifying the flood threat severity at a national level, as follows:\n\n| THREAT   SEVERITY   | FLOOD THREAT COMMERCIAL LOANS   | FLOOD THREAT   MORTGAGE LOANS   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Low                 | 88%                             | 77%                             |\n| Medium              | 11%                             | 21%                             |\n| High                | 1.0%                            | 2%                              |\n\nWe constantly update this information, adding new loans every month from our portfolios, georeferencing them to establish flood risk levels. In 2023, we will enhance data related to landslide hazards.\n\n## SCENARIO ANALYSIS FOR PHYSICAL RISKS\n\nScenario analysis enables a forward-looking perspective consistent with increased climate-related physical risks and allows us to weigh the financial implications of a range of assumptions to inform decisions on policy, criteria, and financial planning.\n\nTo fine-tune our scenario analysis for physical risks in 2022, we focused on integrating, through a pilot exercise, data from WorldClim, creating analytical layers for Colombia.\n\nWorldclim.org data is publicly available, showing results from all models used to build climate change maps for each of the RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathway), depicting various CO/two.denominator concentration scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 7.0 and RCP 8.5) ranging from the year 2021 to the year 2100.\n\nBy generating results based on global model data available in WorldClim, we were able to start a comparative analysis against the results of the pilot project carried out in 2021 based on Ideam's Third Communication. This comparison enriched our methodology and helped us to design our own management model, more accurate and with more recent data for the RCPs.\n\nThe results derived from the WorldClim models enabled us to identify and prioritize the regions with the greatest temperature and rainfall fluctuations, based on historical averages in Colombia. Subsequently, we analyzed existing loans in these areas to ascertain the amount and percentage of loans that could be exposed to greater climate change events in the long term as well as the economic activities that could suffer the greatest impact due to climate change.\n\nThis work stems from collaboration with the innovation team of Seguros Bolivar, especially to georeference the bank's portfolios and update the flood and landslide hazard layers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 293 new loan applications\n\nIn 2022 we assessed 293 new loan applications for projects submitted by our customers in the Corporate, Business, Leasing, and Construction segments.",

The scenarios used in this process are not intended as forecasts, but rather as decarbonization pathways that have the potential to behave in a certain way in the face of climate change.\n\n- 3 Paris Agreement Capital Transition Assessment, a climate scenario analysis methodology with open source and free to use online; it is used by more than 4,000 /financial institutions in more than 90 countries.\n\n## Parameters of PACTA Analysis\n\n| INDUSTRY/  PROCESS                           | SCENARIO   USED                           | TEMPERATURE INCREASE /parenleft.capLIKELIHOOD/parenright.cap   | SELECTED   REGION      |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Oil and gas:  Extraction Energy, generation: | SDS* (WEO2021) NetZero 2050 (IEA**)       | 1.7\u00b0C   (50%) 1.5\u00b0C  (50%) 1.8\u00b0C  (50%)                        | Latin America (SDS)    |\n| A Hydro A Gas A Renewable                    | Announced pledges  Scenario (APS*, IEA**) | 1.7\u00b0C   (50%) 1.5\u00b0C  (50%) 1.8\u00b0C  (50%)                        | Global (NetZero 20250) |\n| Cement   and concrete                        | SDS* (WEO2021) NetZero 2050 (IEA**)       | 1.7\u00b0C   (50%) 1.5\u00b0C  (50%) 1.8\u00b0C  (50%)                        | Global (NetZero 20250) |\n|                                              | NetZero 2050 (IEA**)                      | 1.5\u00b0C  (50%)                                                   |                        |\n\nSource: PACTA for Banks Methodology Document, 2022\n\n- * SDS: Sustainable development scenario\n- ** IEA: International Energy Agency\n- *** APS: Announced pledges scenario\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The PACTA methodology\n\nIn the analysis of transition risk scenarios, we applied this methodology that assesses how a portfolio is aligned with various climate scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Measuring financed emissions is key to setting climate action targets, perform better and align with the Paris Agreement. Current target setting initiatives, such as Science Based Targets, rely on baseline calculation for implementation.\n\nWe measured financed emissions across our commercial portfolio by the end of 2021, our baseline. This measure serves as a bedrock upon which we can build our active engagement strategy with our customers.\n\n## RISK APPETITE FRAMEWORK /parenleft.capRAF/parenright.cap\n\nOur risk appetite framework covers a number of areas, such as risk threshold, stakeholders, objectives, and risk metrics. We thereby determine the top layer of the risk appetite framework, which must be articulated with specific metrics for each line of business and/or type of risk, in conjunction with those aspects defined in the organization's strategic plan. We thus bridge organizational strategic development and the quest for profitability with desired or tolerated levels of risk for the organization.\n\nWe moved forward in environmental, social and climate change risk management, improving and updating our environmental risk appetite, using exclusion lists and portfolio thresholds, including metrics for industries most sensitive to climate change risks, as well as business growth approaches to seize opportunities to finance projects focused on climate change adaptation and mitigation.",

This system is aligned with methodologies designed to assess and manage the risks and opportunities derived from climate change and compliance with established goals.\n\nDavivienda monitors its climate action results across banking portfolios using the performance indicators of the Environmental, Social and Climate Change Risk Management System SARAS. We also measure emissions from our financing and investing activities. Additionally, we track green financing, including climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.\n\nWe assess our progress and performance on direct management of CO2 emissions across our operations (Eco-efficiency) based on targets and indicators associated with programs and initiatives aimed at reducing our carbon footprint, such as: Measuring our carbon footprint, environmental offsets, use of non-conventional renewable energy, energy and water efficiency programs, waste management, measurement of paper consumption, green building, and circular economy strategies.\n\nP\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n1\n\nA\n\n<!-- image -->",

Additionally, we encouraged our employees and vendors to improve their consumption habits by raising awareness about how to use and control the consumption of this vital resource.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Total water cosumption\n\n| INDICATOR                                | 2019    | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Water consumption  (m/three.numerator) * | 114,744 | 72,816 | 70,183 | 67,677 |\n| m/three.numerator/ FTE                   | 11.3    | 7.1    | 6.9    | 6.7    |\n| m/three.numerator/m/two.numerator        | 0.4     | 0.3    | 0.3    | 0.2    |\n\n- * Ajustamos la cifra de consumo de agua de 2021, teniendo en cuenta que a la fecha de publicaci\u00f3n del anterior informe se contaba con informaci\u00f3n proyectada.

For non-usable waste, our vendors disposed such waste appropriately.\n\n## MEASURING PAPER CONSUMPTION\n\n- Our Paperless Bank program has enabled us to advance towards document digitalization and consumption reduction, thereby saving 637 tons of paper, equivalent to saving 10,829 adult trees 5 from being cut down. The paper that we did use was reincorporated into the production chain.\n\n## GREEN BUILDING\n\nIn 2022, we refurbished 38 buildings using cutting-edge materials, furnishings, and water and energy efficiency, investing 9 billion COP. This projects is supported by international certifications.\n\n- 5 One ton of recycled paper is equivalent to saving the lives of 17 adult trees. The conversion is obtained by multiplying 637 tons of recycled paper by 17 trees. Source: National Geographic, 2020. Why is it important to recycle paper?

We delivered 93 thousand credit cards made from 100% recycled PVC from different industries such as packaging, printing, and the automotive industry. In addition, our emblematic Casita Roja piggy bank is now produced with post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic.\n\n## A Collection\n\nWe compiled disused assets and goods for reuse. We participated in the toner reverse logistics program with Lexmark, whereby we properly disposed of 1,295 toner cartridges under a zero landfill and zero incineration policy .\n\n## A Repair and Reuse\n\nWe refurbished 3.7 tons of furniture such as chairs, tables and others, which we reused in our headquarters and branches. We also donated 50 chairs to our Cultivarte location in Barranquilla, sold 3,319 assets to our employees and managed nearly 129 tons of materials from disused furniture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Circular economy\n\nIn 2022, we strengthened our circular economy strategy with actions focused on raw materials, design, production, reuse, repair, collection, recycling, and waste management.\n\n## A Recycling and Waste Management\n\nWe included all recycling, recovery, treatment, destruction, composting and final waste disposal processes, in an effort to reduce and take advantage of the largest possible number of materials, and also to reduce the hazardous nature of the waste. In 2022, we expanded our facilities certifying their recycling process from 288 to 384 sites.\n\n## A Waste Management Follow-up\n\nWe properly managed our architectural and maintenance vendors; 26 tons of waste were delivered to authorized companies and 57.5 thousand m3 of debris from remodeling and maintenance work at our sites were properly disposed of.\n\n## A Other Actions\n\n## Under our 'Batteries, if you throw them\n\naway, you pollute' program, in October we collected 5,878 obsolete batteries throughout the country, both from our operations and from our employees, properly disposing of them through our partner Batteries for the Environment.\n\nAs part of our circular economy strategy , we joined Andi's 30/30 Vision initiative to continue properly handling our containers and packaging (E&E), contributing to the achievement of national goals, under Resolution 1407 of 2018 issued by the Ministry of the Environment and Sustainable Development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

OTHER ASPECTS\n\n## LEGAL STANDING / LITIGATION, LEGAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS / SANCTIONS FOR COMPROMISING CUSTOMERS\n\nCurrently, there are no lawsuits against the Bank that could affect its solvency or stability. The most significant proceedings are listed in Note 12.24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## FREE MOVEMENT OF INVOICES\n\nThe Bank hereby certifies that it complies with the provisions set forth in Article 87 of Law 1676 of 2013, to the extent that it does not prevent the free movement of invoices by withholding invoices or engaging in similar actions. Banco Davivienda complies with Article 87 of Law 1676 of 2013.\n\n## ADMINISTRATIVE STANDING\n\nAs of December 2022, Banco Davivienda employed 10,734 employees under open-ended contracts and 1,303 under fixed-term contracts, totaling 12,037 employees.\n\n## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY / LIST OF PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISES, AND OTHER COPYRIGHTS\n\nBanco Davivienda complies with all applicable regulations governing intellectual property and maintains a structural system for these purposes. This includes special policies in place for IP assets, personnel in charge of managing related processes and enforcing policies, permanent controls, and monitoring processes designed to provide legal safeguards when launching new products and services, in addition to permanent oversight and monitoring systems covering 15 countries.\n\nCurrently, Banco Davivienda and its Colombian subsidiaries hold an intellectual property portfolio of 448 trademarks (distinctive signs) registered or filed with the Superintendence of Industry and Commerce as the competent National Industrial Property Bureau. Davivienda\u00ae, Daviplata\u00ae and Casita Roja de Davivienda\u00ae trademarks are acknowledged as 'notorious' trademarks. These trademarks are material for carrying out the Company's corporate purpose and, hence have been renewed in 2022, thereby benefiting from global\n\nspecial protection mechanisms, enforceable even in jurisdictions where the Bank does not operate.\n\nDavivienda has filed 5 patent applications to date in Colombia.\n\nDavivienda holds five copyright registrations (deposits) for its tangible assets with the Colombian National Copyright Directorate (DNDA).\n\nDavivienda holds 1,126 registrations or pending applications: 448 in Colombia and 678 in other countries.\n\nDavivienda's main brands are also protected in every country where the Bank operates directly. Additionally, Davivienda is protected by preventive registrations in countries where it does not operate directly, but that are strategically relevant internationally, enabling potential future expansions at any time.\n\nDavivienda operates a sound trademark oversight system that enables the Bank to discover potentially infringing trademarks and to file infringement actions or administrative defense actions, in 15 countries in the Americas.\n\n1\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

CONSOLIDATED AND INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (FREE TRANSLATION OF THE REPORT ISSUED IN SPANISH) STATUTORY AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nTo the Shareholders Banco Davivienda S.A.:\n\n## Opinion\n\nI have audited the consolidated financial statements of Banco Davivienda S.A. y Subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022 and the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and their respective notes that include the summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes.\n\nIn my opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2022, the consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia, applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing accepted in Colombia (ISAs). My responsibilities in accordance with those standards are described in the section 'Statutory Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the consolid ated Financial Statements ' of my report. I am independent with respect to the Group, in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Accounting Professionals issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) included in the Information Assurance Standards accepted in Colombia together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the consolidated financial statements established in Colombia and I have complied with my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code mentioned above. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n<!-- image -->",

Such determination is one of the most significant and complex estimates in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, due to the high degree of judgment involved in the development of models to determine impairment based on an expected loss approach required by IFRS 9. The value of the loan portfolio and its respective impairment as of December 31, 2022 is $144,787,324 million and $6,318,527 million, respectively.\n\nI considered the assessment of loan portfolio impairment as a key audit matter because it involves significant measurement complexity that required judgment, knowledge and experience in the industry particularly in relation to (1) the evaluation of the methodologies used, including the methodology for estimating loss given default; (2) the probability of loss given default and its key factors and assumptions; (3) the loan grading and qualitative factors that are incorporated within the internal model variables established by the Group; and (4) the estimated credit risk impairment calculations for the entire loan portfolio.\n\nMy audit procedures for assessing the adequacy of credit risk impairment included, among others, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Engagement of professionals with experience and expertise in credit risk assessment and information technology to evaluate certain internal controls related to the Group's process for determining loan portfolio impairment. This included controls related to (1) validation of the models that determine the probability of loss, LGD and exposure at default, (2) the Group's monitoring of the determination of portfolio impairment (3) information technology controls over the input data to the models that determine credit impairment, as well as related calculations; (4) the assessment to identify whether there was a significant change in credit risk; (5) the evaluation of macroeconomic variables and weighted scenarios used in the models for the determination of credit portfolio impairment; and (6) the verification of controls related to the evaluation of individually analyzed trade receivables and write-offs.\n- \u00b7 Professionals with expertise in credit risk assessment and information technology assisted me in (1) evaluating the methodologies and key data used to determine the probability of loss, loss severity and exposure at default and the parameters produced by the models; (2) evaluating the macroeconomic variables and weighted probability scenarios used in the internal models including consideration of alternative data for certain variables; (3) recalculating the expected loss model and its related data; and (4) evaluating the\n\n3\n\nqualitative adjustments applied to the model.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are presented solely for comparative purposes, were audited by me and in my report dated February 23, 2022, I expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the contents of the annual report, related to: \"Message from the president, results of our business, financial results and schedules\", but does not include the consolidated financial statements and my audit report thereon, nor the management report on which I express an opinion in the Other legal and regulatory requirements section, in accordance with the provisions of Article 38 of Law 222 of 1995.\n\nMy opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not address the other information, and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on this information.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the consolidated financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether there is a material inconsistency between that information and the consolidated financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be a material misstatement.\n\nIf, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material misstatement in this other information, I am required to report that fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibility of the Group's management and those charged with corporate governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and for using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise due to fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken based on these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism during the audit. I also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one arising from error, because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether or not a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may indicate significant doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I should draw attention in my report to the disclosure that describes this situation in the consolidated financial statements or, if this disclosure is inadequate, I should modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to operate as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events so as to achieve a fair presentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- \uf0b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Group's audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate to those charged with governance of the Group, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide those charged with governance with confirmation that I have complied with relevant ethical independence requirements and that I have disclosed to them all relationships and other matters that might reasonably be thought to bear on my independence and, where appropriate, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, I determine the matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and, accordingly, are the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my Auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely exceptional circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably outweigh the benefits to the public interest of such communication.\n\n(Original signed in Spanish) Gustavo Adolfo Roa Camargo Statutory Auditor of Banco Davivienda S.A.

I performed my procedures in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) accepted in Colombia (ISAE 3000, which was translated into Spanish and issued in April 2009 by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n(IAASB, and translated into Spanish in 2018). Such standard requires that I plan and perform the procedures necessary to obtain reasonable assurance about compliance with the bylaws and the Sole  Shareholder's  Meeting decisions and whether there are and are adequate the measures of internal control, maintenance and c ustody of the Society's assets and third parties' assets that are in its possession, in accordance with the requirements of the internal control system implemented by management, in all material aspects.\n\nThe Accountants Firm to which I belong and who appoi nted me as the Society's statutory auditor, applies  the  International  Quality  Control  Standard  No.  1  and,  consequently,  maintains  a comprehensive  quality  control  system  that  includes  policies  and  procedures  documented  on compliance with ethical requirements, applicable legal and regulatory professional standards.\n\nI have complied with the independence and ethics requirements of the Accountant's Professional Code of Ethics issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants -IESBA, which is based on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nThe procedures selected depend on my professional judgment, including the assessment of the risk that the acts of the administrators do not comply with the bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders'  Meeting  and  that  the  internal  control  measures,  which  include  the  risk management and consumer care systems implemented SARL, SARM, SARO, SARC, SARLAFT and SAC, and the measures for the conservation and custody of the Company's assets or those of third parties in its possession are not adequately designed and implemented, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1, Title 1, Chapter IV and Part III, Title V, Chapter I of the Basic Legal Circular of the Superintendency of Finance of Colombia.\n\nThis reasonable assurance engagement includes obtaining evidence for the year ending December 31, 2022. Procedures include:\n\n- \uf0b7 Obtaining a written representation from Management as to whether the acts of the directors are in accordance with the bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders' Meeting and as to whether  internal  control  measures  are  in  place  and  adequate,  which  include  the  risk management  and  consumer  care  systems  implemented  SARL,  SARM,  SARO,  SARC, SARLAFT and SAC, and the measures for conservation and custody of the Company's assets or those of third parties in its possession, in accordance with the requirements of Part 1, Title 1, Chapter IV and Part III, Title V, Chapter I of  the Basic Legal Circular of the Superintendence of Finance of Colombia.\n- \uf0b7 Reading and v erifying compliance with the Society's bylaws .\n- \uf0b7 Obtaining  a  management  certification  on  the  meetings  of  the  Sole  Shareholder ' s  Meeting, documented in the minutes.\n- \uf0b7 Reading of the Sole Shareholder 's Meeting's minutes and the bylaws and verification of whether the management performance conforms to them.\n- \uf0b7 Inquiries with Management about changes or modification projects to the Society's bylaws during the period covered and validation of its implementation.",

On the other hand, the inherent limitations of internal control include human error, failures due  to  the  collusion  of  two  or  more  people,  or  inappropriate  oversight  of  controls  by  the administration.\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe criteria considered for the evaluation of the matters mentioned in paragraph Description of the main subject matter include: (a) the bylaws and the minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting and, (b) the internal control components implemented by the Company, such as the control environment, risk assessment procedures, its information and communications systems and the monitoring of controls by management and those charged with corporate governance, which are based on the provisions of Part 1, Title 1, Chapter IV and Part III, Title V, Chapter I of the Basic Legal Circular of the Financial Superintendency of Colombia.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nMy conclusion is based on the evidence obtained on the matters described and is subject to the inherent limitations set forth in this report. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained provides a reasonable assurance basis for my conclusion expressed below:\n\nIn my opinion, the acts of the directors are in accordance with the bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders' Meeting and the internal control measures are adequate, which include the risk management and customer service systems implemented SARL, SARM, SARO, SARC, SARLAFT and SAC, and the measures for conservation and custody of the Company's assets or those  of  third  parties  in  its  possession,  in  all  material  aspects,  in  accordance  with  the requirements of Part 1, Title 1, Chapter IV and Part III, Title V, Chapter I of the Basic Legal Circular of the Financial Superintendency of Colombia.\n\n(Original signed in Spanish) Gustavo Adolfo Roa Camargo Statutory Auditor of Banco Davivienda S.A.

(the Bank), which comprise the separate statement of financial position as of December 31, 2022, and the separate statements of income, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes, which comprise the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nIn my opinion, the separate financial statements referred to above, prepared in accordance with information faithfully taken from the books and attached to this report, present fairly, in all material respects, the unconsolidated financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2022, the unconsolidated results of its operations and its unconsolidated cash flows for the year then ended, in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia, applied on a consistent basis with the preceding year.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing accepted in Colombia (ISAs). My responsibilities in accordance with those standards are described in the section \"Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditor in connection with the audit of the separate financial statements\" of my report. I am independent with respect to the Bank, in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Accounting Professionals issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) included in the Information Assurance Standards accepted in Colombia together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the separate financial statements established in Colombia and I have complied with my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code mentioned above. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the separate financial statements of the current period.

This included controls related to: (1) approvals and follow-up by the Board of Directors of the methodology for the estimation of the additional general allowance for the consumer loan portfolio; (2) the Bank's monitoring of changes in the risk of the consumer loan portfolio customers; (3) information technology controls over the input data to the models that determine the additional general allowance for consumer loans, as well as the related calculations; and (4) the evaluation of the macroeconomic variables considered for the estimation of the additional general\n\ncontingent quotas for the impact on income in the face of the economic slowdown and (3) the segmentation of customers considering their credit risk.\n\n4\n\n## allowance for consumer loans.\n\n- \uf0b7 Professionals with expertise in credit risk assessment and information technology assisted me in: (1) evaluating the methodology and key data used to determine the additional general allowance for consumer loan portfolio, (2) evaluating the macroeconomic variables, (3) recalculating the additional allowances, and (4) evaluating the qualitative adjustments applied to the model.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe separate financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 are presented solely for comparative purposes, were audited by me and in my report dated February 23, 2022, I expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Responsibility of the Bank's management and those charged with corporate governance for the separate financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these separate financial statements in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia. This responsibility includes: designing, implementing and maintaining such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nIn preparing the separate financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and for using the going concern basis of accounting unless management intends to liquidate the Bank or cease operations, or there is no more realistic alternative than to proceed in one of these ways.\n\nThose charged with corporate governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditor in connection with the audit of the separate financial statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate financial statements taken as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,\n\n3\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance means a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise due to fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism during the audit. I also:\n\n- \uf0b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the separate financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is greater than that arising from error, because fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override or override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 I obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 I conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may indicate significant doubt about the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I should draw attention in my report to the disclosure describing this situation in the separate financial statements or, if such disclosure is inadequate, I should modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to operate as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the separate financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate financial statements present the underlying transactions and events so as to achieve a fair presentation.\n- \uf0b7 I obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the group financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Group's audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\nI communicate to those charged with governance of the Bank, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, as well as significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide those charged with governance with confirmation that I have complied with relevant ethical independence requirements and that I have disclosed to them all relationships and other matters that might reasonably be considered to bear on my independence and, where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, I determine the matters that were of most significance in the audit of the current period's separate financial statements and, therefore, are the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my Auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely exceptional circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably outweigh the benefits to the public interest of such communication.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n- 1. Based on the results of my tests, in my opinion, during 2022:\n- a) The Bank's accounts have been kept in accordance with legal regulations and accounting techniques.\n- b) The operations recorded in the books are in conformity with the bylaws and the decisions of the General Shareholders' Meeting.\n- c) The correspondence, account vouchers, minute books and share registry books are duly kept and maintained.\n- d) There has been compliance with the rules and provisions of the Financial Superintendence of Colombia related to the adequate administration and provision of assets received in payment and with the implementation and impact on the separate statement of financial position and separate statement of income of the applicable risk management systems.\n- e) The provisions of Law 2195 of 2022 have been complied with in relation to the Transparency and Business Ethics Program, through instructions from the Superintendence of Finance of Colombia related to the Asset Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Risk Management System - SARLAFT or applicable Internal Control System, according to Concept 2022033680-002-000 of April 7, 2022 issued by this control entity.",

On the other hand, the inherent limitations of internal control include human error, failures due  to  the  collusion  of  two  or  more  people,  or  inappropriate  oversight  of  controls  by  the administration.\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe criteria considered for the evaluation of the matters mentioned in paragraph Description of the main subject matter include: (a) the bylaws and the minutes of the Shareholders' Meeting and, (b) the internal control components implemented by the Company, such as the control environment, risk assessment procedures, its information and communications systems and the monitoring of controls by management and those charged with corporate governance, which are based on the provisions of Part 1, Title 1, Chapter IV and Part III, Title V, Chapter I of the Basic Legal Circular of the Financial Superintendency of Colombia.\n\n## Conclusion",

These standards are periodically evaluated by the Vice Presidency of Internal Audit and other control bodies.\n\nBanco Davivienda S.A.'s ICS features the following characteristics:\n\n- \u25cf To encourage and maintain an adequate control environment built upon organizational culture, raising awareness among employees.\n- \u25cf To continuously strengthen the established risk management systems, supporting operations by establishing objectives, identifying incidents, assessing them, and responding to risks.\n- \u25cf Define and implement control activities and procedures required to manage risks; periodically assess how such activities and procedures are performing and formulate mitigation plans accordingly to the evaluated risks.\n- \u25cf Take appropriate actions aimed at protecting, storing, accessing, preserving, safeguarding, and disclosing information, ensuring data reliability, integrity and availability; effectively communicating key information to relevant parties and stakeholders.\n- \u25cf Set and enforce policies and procedures aimed at ensuring continuous monitoring and oversight by both management and upper management.\n\nTo verify the effectiveness of the ICS, the Bank is supported by the Audit Vice-presidency and the Risk Management areas who, according to the three lines of defense scheme, carry out evaluation and monitoring; likewise, they identify the areas that execute internal control from the First Line. The above, in the following way:\n\nFirst Line: Includes those who are responsible for processes, who are in charge of designing, executing, and overseeing controls that mitigate risks associated with financial reporting.\n\nThe main duties of the First Line are: designing, executing, and overseeing controls related to identifying, measuring, and disclosing financial information. These controls are applied throughout the entire process, starting from initial transactions to their preparation, consolidation, and disclosure through the various institutional channels and control bodies.\n\nThese processes are formally documented and there are well-defined and effective execution and oversight controls in place to provide reasonable assurance in terms of financial reporting risk mitigation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSecond Line: Risk areas monitor the Entity's controls under a second-line approach. This includes key financial reporting controls, namely those designed to ensure the proper recording, processing, and disclosure of financial information.\n\nVarious methodologies are used to monitor these controls, such as:\n\n- \u25cf Evaluation of controls in conjunction with those responsible for processes (first line).\n- \u25cf Focused and prioritized monitoring to measure the reasonableness and effectiveness of controls.\n\nBased on these results, identified opportunities for improvement are conveyed to those in charge of processes, improvement actions are defined, and control ratings are updated, if required.\n\nThird Line: The Bank's Audit Vice-presidency assesses the Internal Control System to determine if it is reasonable to assure that it is effective, encompassing financial reporting matters (Accounting Management).\n\nThe Internal Audit Vice-presidency independently and objectively assesses risk management, internal control, and corporate governance. Based on its findings, it shares recommendations aimed at improving processes and operations. Key financial reporting controls are embedded in these evaluations. The assessments in 2022 were conducted under the approved planning, following a risk level prioritization exercise for the various processes within the Bank, guided by the Strategy Map and regulatory and legal obligations. No material deficiencies were identified upon revision of financial reporting related processes.\n\nInternal Audit followed up on the action plans defined by those responsible for processes, who followed the recommendations made and continue to do so; similarly, the Audit Committee and additional Corporate Governance bodies monitored the status of implementation and effectiveness of such plans, thereby contributing towards achieving our mission to properly present and disclose financial information.\n\nAs a result of the activities conducted by the three defined lines, no significant deficiencies were detected that would have prevented the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of the financial information.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRICARDO LE\u00d3N OTERO Legal Representative",
