The tremendous stress that mankind has exerted on natural resources, since the advent of the Industrial Revolution, has brought us to a stage where we need to collectively ramp up our e/uniFB00orts to combat climate change.\n\nThe Paris Agreement of 2015 entered into at the 21 st Conference of Parties (COP 21) brought the world together in this pursuit. Our company's ESG ambitions are aligned with this global quest. On a personal note, it is a privilege for me to serve on the Advisory Committee of COP 28 UAE, and contribute to this ongoing e/uniFB00ort.\n\n## Shri Mukesh D. Ambani\n\nChairman and Managing Director, Reliance Industries\n\nOur goal is to become Net Carbon Zero by 2035. Accordingly, the development of giga factories at the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Complex at Jamnagar is progressing rapidly. Considering the collective potential of our five giga factories, we are well on track for establishing a world class, self-su/uniFB03cient green energy ecosystem. The transition from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is going to be a crucial milestone in our history. We, as a company, have a proven record of creating value through transformational changes, be it the digital revolution through Jio, transforming consumer experience and the retail landscape in India or the integration of our refining and petrochemicals businesses into the oil to chemicals value chain.\n\nA switch to cleaner energy sources is key to our decarbonisation strategy. We are making significant strides in establishing a world class solar energy value chain. We are also progressing on building a green hydrogen ecosystem. Our goal is to provide a/uniFB00ordable green hydrogen as a viable alternative to traditional fuels.\n\nAdoption of concepts like circularity in our chemical products also brings us closer to a low carbon economy. We have partnered with accomplished innovator entities globally, with whom we share the common goal of establishing a sustainable world economy. We are leveraging their expertise to derive maximum value for our new energy initiatives. We recognise the urgency of addressing the issues emanating from climate change. We believe our new energy initiatives will contribute to the global e/uniFB00ort of limiting the rise in average temperatures.\n\nIt is important for us to ensure the wellbeing of our employees and communities. We lay great emphasis on the health, safety and development of all our employees, customers, business partners and local communities. Human rights considerations have been at the core of Reliance's DNA since inception. The principles of human rights are enshrined in our internal codes of conduct as well as our business partner codes of conduct. Our Reliance Foundation works round the clock driving initiatives in education, healthcare and social development that have impacted millions of lives over the years. Abiding by our principle of inclusive growth, our teams across businesses work at a grass root level to identify the needs of every stakeholder involved and commit to securing their interests and maintaining their satisfaction.\n\nManaging large and diverse businesses is not possible without a robust governance structure. We, as a company, have always strived to maintain the highest levels of governance in our management. We emphasise the importance of Board oversight, given the fact that the company's diverse and evolving operations impact essential sectors of the Indian economy. The Board Committees at Reliance have clearly defined roles and mandates. We are committed to adhering to the best practices and to adapting to emerging standards of governance.\n\nPursuing the path of good governance, we constituted the ESG committee to ensure our continued alignment to best ESG practices and compliance with applicable ESG frameworks. The committee will advise the board and other committees on environmental, social and governance aspects involved in the conduct of business activities.\n\nWe have entered an era of transformation - transformation to a greener and a more inclusive economy. Our businesses, our people and our practices are evolving and adapting to the new age with a renewed zest. Our newest growth engine, our new energy business is poised to become a pioneer and lead the way towards just global energy transition.\n\n## Creation of an Independent Financial Services Business\n\nMy dear friends, as you are aware that this year we have demerged our financial services arm into a separate listed entity named 'Jio Financial Services Limited' (JFS). I thank you for your wholehearted support to this initiative.\n\nToday's India is young and entrepreneurial, adopting digital finance at an unprecedented pace. The digital revolution has penetrated every corner of the nation through Jandhan Accounts, digital payments, usage of smart phones and low cost data. The growth opportunities presented by financial services are remarkable and\n\nCONSOLIDATED EBITDA\n\n## H 1,53,920 CRORE\n\n## CONSOLIDATED NET PROFIT H\n\n## 73,670 CRORE\n\nprovide a strong directional support to the economy.\n\nAs various financial services are governed by di/uniFB00erent regulatory frameworks, we believe, an independent financial services entity will allow us to access the opportunities available in the\n\nIndian market.\n\nJio Financial Services Limited along with its subsidiaries will leverage the technological capabilities of Reliance and digitally deliver financial services, democratising access to financial services o/uniFB00erings for Indian citizens. Jio Financial Services aims to provide simple, a/uniFB00ordable and innovative digital first solutions.\n\nJio Financial Services Limited is positioned uniquely to capture the growth opportunities in financial services sector and play a crucial role in transforming the landscape of digital finance in India.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for the Year\n\nThere was continued volatility in the global markets amidst disruptions in trade flows and economic uncertainties. Despite the headwinds, Reliance was able to deliver another year of remarkable performance both on operating and financial fronts. Consolidated EBITDA was at ' 1,53,920 crore which is a robust 24.4% growth as compared to last year. Consolidated net profit also grew at 11.3% to ' 73,670 crore.\n\nThe impressive growth was well rounded and supported by all our business segments. Consumer businesses continued their growth trajectory with a rapid expansion of retail store footprint and strong subscriber acquisition in Jio. O2C business delivered a record performance amidst a challenging business environment.",

This has helped us maintain a strong and conservative balance sheet and retain superior investment grade ratings.\n\n## Robust Operational Performance\n\nReliance touches the lives of millions of consumers in India and worldwide through its energy and consumer businesses.

The rollout of FTTH services also gained momentum during the year.\n\nMillions of viewers enjoyed the live action of the FIFA World Cup, the first ever Women's Premier League and the 16 th edition of the Indian\n\nPremier League on Jio Cinema. Jio Platforms powered the technology behind streaming these events. The new home broadband back up plan is the latest addition to the bouquet of broadband services and is expected to grow the broadband market further.\n\nJio retained its preeminent position in the Indian telecom space with 439.3 million subscribers as on March 2023, with a net addition of 29.2 million subscribers during the year. The strong growth in the digital services business is aptly reflected in its financial performance for the year. With an increase of 24.9% from the previous year, digital services EBITDA for FY 2022-23 stood at ' 50,286 crore.\n\nJio commits itself to continually innovate and launch newer technologies and products and expand the market for digital services. Jio True 5G stack is one such feature loaded indigenous technology, o/uniFB00ering superior performance. It is secure, cost e/uniFB00ective and also easy to install. This technology is fully cloud native, software defined, digitally managed and supports advanced features like Quantum Security. Jio AirFiber is also an innovative solution, o/uniFB00ering clutter free and high speed connectivity to users with the capability of supporting multiple devices simultaneously without compromising on the quality of connectivity. JioDive is a technology that helps users to explore the virtual reality universe through a smartphone based headset. JioDive runs on the JioImmerse application which o/uniFB00ers users exclusive VR experiences in gaming, learning, entertainment and wellness, all accessible through their smartphone.\n\nI believe Jio's digital o/uniFB00erings have established it as a strong market leader in India's digital services ecosystem. The scale of Jio's operation and advantages of deep penetration help Jio grow stronger with the launch of each new o/uniFB00ering. Jio's vision is to make the highest level of connectivity available to the masses at a/uniFB00ordable prices at all times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u2192 PAGE 50\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Retail\n\nReliance Retail further consolidated its position as the largest retailer in India and the only Indian retailer to feature in the top 100 retailers globally. FY 2022-23 witnessed Reliance Retail cross the 1 billion transactions mark.\n\nThe retail business expanded its store network with over 3,300 new stores added during the financial year, taking the store tally to 18,040 stores Pan-India. Our stores now cover 65.6 million sq ft of store area which is a more than 50% growth of retail space as compared to the previous year. Footfalls increased by 50% from last year to 780 million. The registered customer base also grew to 249 million, establishing Reliance Retail as the preferred shopping venue of Indian citizen across formats.\n\nDuring the year, Reliance Retail entered into the beauty segment by launching the 'Tira' digital platform and opening its flagship store in Mumbai. The business also expanded its product basket through acquisitions and partnerships at both local and global levels like Metro, Campa Cola, GAP, Pret A Manger, Lotus, Sosyo, Maliban, To/uniFB00eeman to name a few.\n\nReliance Retails runs an integrated network of physical stores, digital commerce and new commerce initiatives. Through digital brands like Ajio and Netmeds, digital commerce is scaling up at a rapid pace and is contributing to the strong growth of retail segment. The launch of JioMart on WhatsApp is a truly novel initiative which combines online shopping experience with the simplicity of instant chat services. Growth in new commerce business has been fast paced with rapid expansion of its merchant partner network.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 105\n\nDuring the year our teams across sites worked towards finding sustainable solutions. The first ever green hydrogen production was achieved with firing of torrefied biomass in gasifiers. Biomass firing in Coal Fired Boilers (CFBs) at petrochemical sites increased to >11% of total feed in line with our decarbonisation e/uniFB00orts. Ethanol blending in motor spirit (EBMS) facility was also commissioned. We also successfully commissioned the demo plant for our patented Continuous Catalytic Pyrolysis oil technology.\n\nOur O2C business is transforming. From switch to renewable sources of energy and newer energy technologies to promoting the concept of circular economy especially for our petrochemical products, sustainable business techniques are rapidly gaining momentum.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 116\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Oil and Gas Exploration and Production\n\n## Performance of the exploration and production segment was noteworthy for the year. The\n\nrevenue more than doubled and the EBITDA was 2.5x the previous year number at ' 13,589 crore. The growth in EBITDA was primarily on account of improved gas price realisation and higher gas production in the KG D6 block. Domestic production was, in fact, at a 10-year high. I am proud to share that we have an exceptional record of safety in our upstream business with another year 100% incident free operations.\n\nCurrently, more than 3 million merchants have partnered with our new commerce platforms.\n\nRetail segments EBITDA stood at ' 17,974 crore which reflects a strong 44.7% increase from the previous year. The EBITDA growth was well supported by all verticals right from grocery to fashion and lifestyle.\n\nReliance Retail is an indispensable part of the Indian household's shopping experience not only in metro regions but also in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. Reliance Retail envisions to expand its o/uniFB00erings and scale of operations to make best in class products available to the Indian consumers at a/uniFB00ordable prices.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 94\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Oil to Chemicals\n\nDespite facing major operational challenges given the highly volatile global scenarios, our O2C business posted highest ever earnings excluding the impact of SAED.\n\nRevenues increased on account of improved price realisation for transportation fuel, tracking higher average oil prices for the year. O2C business EBITDA stood at ' 62,075 crore with a healthy 17.7% increase as compared to last year despite considering the SAED levy of ' 6,648 crore. EBITDA growth was driven by feedstock flexibility, sharp improvements in fuel cracks and advantageous ethane cracking.\n\nDuring the year, our refinery processed 13 new variants of crude oil, broadening the feedstock sources. Demand for transportation fuels was strong for the year reflecting the opening up of economies post pandemic restrictions. Demand for downstream chemical products remained subdued globally, but was strong in the domestic markets.\n\nMJ field at the KG D6 Block commenced production post testing and commissioning activities. At peak production of ~30 MMSCMD, KG D6 block will contribute ~30% of the domestic gas production. Operationalization of the KG D6 MJ gas field is a crucial step towards enhancing India's energy security.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDear fellow shareholders, Reliance, as a company has grown multifold by delivering value to the citizens, the country and global community. Our products are ingrained in the lives of the citizens and are an integral part of their daily routines. Our various businesses have always identified the needs of the society and worked towards devising and making available timely and a/uniFB00ordable solutions.\n\nThe current needs of the society are sustainable solutions which can tackle climate change through a/uniFB00ordable green energy and inclusive growth. Our initiatives in New Energy businesses and our consumer businesses are aimed at meeting societal needs and aspirations.\n\nUsing the right technology, deploying the right talent and through empowering our young leaders, I am confident that we can make the world a better place to live in for future generations.\n\nI would like to express my sincere appreciation to the Board of Directors for their continued guidance. I would like to thank our teams across businesses, for their dedicated work and commitment to excellence. I would also like to extend my gratitude to all our stakeholders for their support and unwavering faith in Reliance.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nMukesh D.

Despite synchronised raising of policy rates by Central Banks and volatility in commodity prices, we contained the rise in finance costs while ensuring the Balance Sheet has strength and liquidity to support growth initiatives.\n\n## Global Economy\n\nGlobal economy grew 3.4% in CY22, slowing from the post-COVID rebound of 6.2% in CY21. Growth was in-line with pre-pandemic average (201519) of 3.4% despite Russia-Ukraine conflict and aggressive rate hikes by central banks. Advanced economies (AEs) saw above-trend growth of 2.7% in CY22, higher than the 2.1% average seen in the five years prior to the pandemic. This was led by strong growth in both US and Euro area which grew at 2.1% % and 3.5% respectively. Inflationary pressures remained near multi-decade highs in AEs, with US inflation averaging 8% Y-o-Y (highest since 1980s), while Euro area inflation also averaged a\n\nmulti-decade high of 8.4%. Developed market central banks aggressively tightened their monetary policy to address inflation, with US Federal Reserve raising rates by 450bps in CY22, while European Central Bank hiked rates by 250 bps. Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) grew 4% in CY22, below the pre-pandemic average of 4.4% due to slowdown in Chinese economy amidst frequent lockdowns. China growth eased to 3%, well below the pre-pandemic average of 6.7% on continued zero-COVID policy and housing downturn. Crude oil prices were elevated during FY 2023, averaging $93/bbl, remaining above $100/bbl in first half of the fiscal year due to Russia-Ukraine conflict,\n\nbut receding in the second half with Chinese demand slowing and release of strategic petroleum reserves from OECD countries.\n\nGlobal growth is expected to slow in CY23 to 2.8% as the lagged impact of synchronised global monetary tightening. Growth in advanced economies is expected to decelerate to 1.3%, with US and Euro area growth expected at 1.6% and 0.8% respectively. E/uniFB00ect of rapid rate hikes over last one year as well as emerging credit crunch risks from US regional banks remain key concerns for advanced economies. Emerging markets growth is expected to hold near pre-pandemic average at ~3.9% in CY23, supported by India and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChina. China growth is expected to rebound to 5.2% in CY23 from 3% on reopening of the economy after three years and continued monetary policy support. India is expected to remain amongst the fastest growing economies as per IMF.\n\n## Indian Economy\n\nThe Indian economy remained relatively stable amidst the global imbalances caused by the RussiaUkraine conflict. The economy grew at 7.2% in FY 2022-23, down from 9.1% in FY 2021-22, as per the National Statistical O/uniFB03ce data release.\n\nThe spike in global commodity prices pushed up prices in India too, with retail inflation peaking at 7.79% in April 2022, above the medium-term target band of 2%-6% of the RBI. The RBI took stringent measures to combat the rising prices, hiking repo rate six times in FY 2022-23, from 4% at the beginning of May 2022 to 6.5% at the close of the financial year. Private consumption, however, witnessed a strong surge fuelling a boost in production across sectors. Domestic sector services activity remained resilient with average Services PMI higher at 57.5 in FY23 vs 52.2 in FY22. Manufacturing too remained robust with average manufacturing PMI higher at 55.8 in FY23 vs 54.1 in FY22. Credit growth gained traction with year-on-year growth of 15% (as of March '23) while deposit growth lagged with year-on-year growth of 9.6%, leading to a rise in incremental credit-deposit ratio.\n\nIndia overtook Japan and Germany to become the third largest automobile market in terms sales in December 2022. India also emerged as the second largest mobile phone manufacturer globally. India's digital adoption continues in an accelerated way. UPI payments continued their impressive run in FY 2022-23, with transaction volumes almost doubling from ~45 billion in FY 2021-22 to ~84 billion in FY 2022-23, while transaction value also surged to ~139 lakh crore\n\nin FY 2022-23 from ~84 lakh crore in FY 2021-22. The pan- India monthly mobile data tra/uniFB03c stood at 14.4 Exabyte in 2022 with 3.2x growth over last five years. Rapid digitisation supported by solid infrastructure is driving e/uniFB03ciency and productivity in the economy. India's external sector continued to gain strength as FY23 merchandise exports grew to $447 billion, growing at 6% Y-o-Y and services exports grew to $322 billion, growing at 27% Y-o-Y.\n\nGlobal supply chain improvements and falling commodity prices coupled with softening domestic demand are likely to moderate inflation to 5.1% in the current financial year. With a growing working age population, a large domestic market, boost to infrastructure development and advent of digitisation, India is well positioned to be the fastest growing large economy in the world. India GDP is expected to grow at 6.5% in FY24.\n\n## Performance Overview\n\nReliance delivered strong annual performance amid macro headwinds caused by geo-political conflicts, disruptions in commodity trade flows and economic downturn. Resilience of Reliance's strategic and operational capabilities reflected in its ability to adapt to dynamic business environments and navigate through complex business situations. Growth was supported by agile and e/uniFB03cient operations by all business teams with sound strategic planning and implementation.\n\nEarnings growth was led by rebound in O2C business, backed by healthy domestic demand, strong fuel margins and high utilisation rates. Oil and gas segment performance reflected volume growth in KG D6 gas production, higher gas price realisations and margin improvements. Operational e/uniFB03ciencies continued with 100% uptime.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nPersistent Inflationary pressures and globally rising interest rate environment were the key underlying themes of financial markets in FY 2022-23. The year was also marked by a sharp depreciation of the Rupee against the Dollar. RIL successfully managed its Balance Sheet risks through the challenging environment while ensuring su/uniFB03cient liquidity for business operations.\n\n## External Environment\n\nA persistent broadening of inflation pressures triggered a rapid and synchronised tightening of global monetary conditions, alongside strong appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies.\n\nThe rising price pressures were expected to produce a squeeze on real incomes as well as undermine macroeconomic stability. This led most Central Banks around the world to rapidly lift nominal policy rates to much above the pre-pandemic levels, both in advanced and emerging market economies. The US Federal Reserve raised policy rates aggressively by 500 bps in past fifteen months, the fastest hiking cycle since 1980. In Europe, the warrelated intensification of inflationary pressures led European Central Bank to finally exit its negative interest rate regime and ultra-easy monetary policy after eight years and raise interest rates by 325 bps in past nine months. The real activity and financial markets responded to the removal of monetary accommodation with slowing momentum in housing market, credit conditions, labour markets and PMI surveys.\n\nIn response to progressive rate hikes by the Central Banks, the global headline inflation started declining in the second half of the year. However, the decline in inflation print reflects the sharp reversal in energy and food prices and the core inflation continues\n\nto remain sticky. Consequently, to anchor inflation expectations major central banks have signalled the need for staying course on a restrictive monetary policy stance.\n\nOn the other side, the accelerated policy normalisation has brought forth vulnerabilities in the US regional banks. The risk of contagion across the broader financial sector is inducing volatility in the financial markets and driving market-implied policy path on downside.\n\nRBI too raised rates by a cumulative 250 bps in the year, in-line with global monetary tightening as inflation remained persistently above RBI's 6% upper-target band. As the forward outlook on inflation moderated towards 5-5.5% in the second half of the year, RBI guided for a conditional pause keeping the policy stance focused on withdrawal of accommodation. A prolonged pause from RBI is expected to progressively align headline inflation to its target while also supporting growth.\n\nOn the external front, a noticeable improvement in India's current account deficit (CAD) on back of moderation in oil prices and structural strength in India's services exports, is expected to keep CAD benign and below 2% of GDP. The outlook on capital inflows also looks promising as emerging markets growth is expected to outperform developed markets. As the lagged e/uniFB00ect of cumulative hikes sets-in, developed markets is expected to witness slowdown. In contrast, India is expected to emerge as the fastest growing economy in FY 2023-24 with 6.5%, while global growth are expected only at 2.8%. Overall, India's growth di/uniFB00erential and comfortable CAD dynamics are expected to keep the Indian Rupee well supported in the near to medium-term.\n\nDespite the unprecedented macro-economic uncertainty, the Company was successfully able to navigate abrupt adjustments in the market, maintain adequate liquidity\n\non its balance sheet, manage its financial market risks and deliver a consistent return on its investment portfolio by staying invested in low risk, liquid instruments. Reliance Treasury continued to stay focused on providing liquidity to the businesses at the optimal risk adjusted cost by accessing financing from di/uniFB00erent markets and using appropriate instruments and currencies.\n\n## Treasury Management and Financial Strategy\n\nReliance's medium term Financial Strategy is guided by a Financial Planning process which is integrated with individual business plans. RIL Treasury's key objectives include raising Long Term financing for capex and Short-Term liabilities for financing working capital at the most e/uniFB03cient rates and also design suitable hedging strategies to manage currency and interest rate risks on both the asset and liability side of company's Balance Sheet.\n\n## Fund Raising\n\nDuring FY 2022-23, the Company and its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) tied up $3 billion equivalent through syndicated term loan facilities. The transaction was heavily oversubscribed in the primary syndication market by global lenders across geographies. The proceeds from the loans were used to meet the capital expenditure requirements of both the companies. This was a landmark transaction on various counts:\n\n- a) The aggregate liquidity raised from primary syndication was $3 billion equivalent, one of the largest liquidity raised through syndication in Asia Pacific (APAC).\n- b) 55 international lenders across all major continents participated in the transaction making it the\n- largest bank group in a corporate loan out of APAC since 2000.\n- c) This is the largest syndicated loan from India\n\nRJIL tied up its first ever Swedish Export Credit Agency (EKN) supported facilities of $2.2 billion equivalent making it the largest cover ever provided by EKN for a deal to a private corporate globally.\n\nThe proceeds of the facilities shall be utilised to finance the equipment and services in relation to RJIL's pan-India 5G roll out.\n\n## Liquidity Management\n\nThe combination of strong cash flows from operations, access to unutilised borrowing facilities, and robust cash and cash equivalents\n\nposition forms the basis of Reliance Industries' liquidity base. This strong liquidity position provides the company with financial flexibility, enabling it to navigate various market conditions, pursue growth opportunities, and meet its financial obligations e/uniFB00ectively.\n\nThe operating cycle is closely monitored to optimise the working capital structure and facilitate short term financing. Our proactive approach to reviewing trade financing solutions and optimising the operating cycle demonstrates our commitment to robust working capital management and e/uniFB00ective business financing. RIL e/uniFB00ectively uses Commercial Paper, Working Capital Demand Loan and other solutions to\n\nfinance its payables and receivables and reduce the cost of funds.\n\nRIL manages its cash and cash equivalents through an investment portfolio, diversified across instruments and counterparties. The investments are in highly liquid instruments such as government bonds, AAA papers, Bank deposits and Debt Mutual Funds. The investment portfolio is monitored under a strong risk management framework assuring adherence to liquidity objectives. The portfolio is calibrated continually to straddle between the objectives of capital protection, steady returns, and provision of adequate liquidity at short notice.\n\n## Credit Rating\n\nRILs focussed approach on financial discipline and risk management is reflected in its strong credit rating as it continues to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and one notch above sovereign by Moody's.\n\n| Instrument         | Rating Agency   | Ratings      | Remarks                                    |\n|--------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| International Debt | S&P             | BBB+         | Two notches above India's sovereign rating |\n| International Debt | Moody's         | Baa2         | One notch above India's sovereign rating   |\n| Long-Term Debt     | CRISIL          | AAA (Stable) | Highest rating by CRISIL                   |\n| Long-Term Debt     | CARE            | AAA (Stable) | Highest rating by CARE                     |\n| Long-Term Debt     | ICRA            | AAA (Stable) | Highest rating by ICRA                     |\n| Long-Term Debt     | India Ratings   | AAA (Stable) | Highest rating by India Ratings            |\n\n## Awards and Accolades\n\nIn FY 2022-23, RIL won the much-coveted IFR Asia Award for 'Investment Grade Bond' for the $4 billion multi-tranche Senior Unsecured Notes issued in January 2022.\n\n## Way Forward\n\nRIL will continue to draw strength from its robust balance sheet and operating cash flows to create value for its shareholders in a sustainable manner by investing in new business opportunities. RIL will continue to monitor financial markets for the right opportunity to raise capital to support growth plans of existing and new businesses while maintaining a keen focus on financial discipline and risk management.",

These include a favourable demographic profile, increasing per capita income, rising aspirations supported by a/uniFB00ordable data that has narrowed the information gap, and improved access to stores and e-commerce in rural areas that has deepened the reach of brands and closed the aspirational divide between urban and rural consumers.\n\nFurthermore, emerging organised retail formats, digital and technological advancements, the ongoing trend of urbanisation and greater access to financing are changing the consumption landscape. With per capita GDP surpassing the critical $2,000 threshold, consumer discretionary spending is likely to trend upward, and these trends together suggest a promising outlook for the Indian retail sector.\n\nReliance Retail with its industry leading store network and emerging digital platforms, investments across the consumption value chain and its track record of strong execution is well poised to lead the industry in the coming decade.",

This leads to low productivity, high animal mortality rates and increased costs. Despite being the leading dairy producer globally, India's per capita milk production is significantly lower than that of global producers.\n\nJio's cattle IoT device will assist in monitoring the activity levels, food habits and rumination of the cattle, and also in the detection of early signs of diseases. The data collected by the device can be shared in real-time for benchmarking and analysing cattle health and productivity using AI. This is then shared with the farmer daily through the Jio GauSamriddhi application.\n\n## CASE STUDY\n\n## Remote Diagnostics and Community Clinics\n\nApproximately 65% of the Indian population lives in rural areas with limited access to high-quality, critical preemptive diagnostics. In addition to this, the doctor-patient ratio is as low as 1:2000. These limitations often lead to delayed detection of diseases, escalated treatment costs, and a higher mortality rate.\n\nTo address this, Jio will enable a robotic teleradiology set-up with a radiological probe at remote sites and a haptic controller at specialist doctor sites. Camera feeds will relay live patient feed and haptic feedback with no latency. Doctors can then examine radiological imaging data and diagnose conditions without being physically present at the location.\n\nJio True 5G-enabled community clinics will bring quality healthcare to remote geographies using the 'Clinic in a Bag' platform. Paramedics and ASHA workers can carry connected probes such as stethoscopes, ECG machines, glucose monitors and ENT probes to remote locations, and real-time feedback can be shared with specialised doctors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\n## CASE STUDY\n\n## Augmenting the Shopping Experience with Smart Retail\n\nWith Jio True 5G, retail experiences are set to transform. Users can create a 3D avatar with a depth sensorenabled camera. Using a life-sized smart mirror, users can virtually try-on a variety of clothing options. This can significantly improve the choices on o/uniFB00er and add convenience to the process, and enhance the shopping experience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE STUDY\n\n## Intelligent Farming with IoT Sensors and Precision Spraying Drones\n\nJio 5G can significantly boost per capita output by relying on IoT and drone-based precision farming solutions. 5G-powered drones can be flown remotely from distant control centres from actual sites such as farmers' premises, district or taluka o/uniFB03ces, or even the state or central headquarters. Drones can cover farmlands and multi-spectral cameras can be used to scan the fields with real-time relay of images\n\non the cloud over the 5G network. The data can then be analysed using AI/ML algorithms to detect insect or pest infestations, soil moisture and irrigation.\n\nJio Krishi IoT devices such as weather stations and soil testers can aid in data-driven farming methods ensuring the optimal use of farming resources, judicious use of harmful chemicals, and improvement in farm productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJio's digital services span the entire ecosystem, and these capabilities will power scale-up of all our businesses. This would equip Jio to spearhead India's transformation into a leading Digital Society. Once proven at scale, these solutions can also be taken to the rest of the world. Jio True 5G is uniquely positioned to deliver the best quality, highest value digital connectivity solutions to every citizen of India. The scale of Jio's 5G rollout will give it a distinct competitive edge and accelerate market share gains. All this will generate strong shareholder returns over the next several decades.\n\n## CAPITALS\n\n<!-- image -->",

Despite the impact of high inflation due to the sharp rise in oil prices post US-Ukraine conflict as well as the disruption of global supply chains in the aftermath of the pandemic, Indian economy fared better than the rest of the world. However, consumer demand slowed down in the first half as prices of consumer goods increased to keep pace with raw material prices. The increase in lending rates in the second half also impacted the industrial growth and consumer spending power.\n\nMedia and Entertainment sector, being inextricably linked to the macro-economic environment, also faced headwinds during the year. While Y-o-Y growth (CY2022 vs CY2021) was strong at ~20%, compared to pre-pandemic levels of 2019, total revenue was only 10% higher. The demand for content continued to grow as consumers increasingly spent more time on media consumption, but monetisation faced challenges on both advertising and subscription fronts. Growth during the year was driven by 30% 5 growth in Digital segment. Digital advertising, including spends by small and medium sized businesses, for whom digital is often the only marketing platform due to limited budgets, commanded more than 50% share of the total ad revenues. TV's share in the total ad pie declined by ~500 bps as the ad revenue on the medium was flat. As per various industry reports, TV and Digital are the most e/uniFB00ective mediums for brand building and reach, capturing nearly 80% share of the total ad spends. Print continued to struggle and despite a 13% Y-o-Y growth, it remains well below the pre-pandemic levels. While cinema advertising continues to languish, theatrical revenues saw a sharp jump\n\n5 Source : FICCI EY Report 2023\n\nas consumers returned to cinemas and several movies achieved phenomenal box-o/uniFB03ce success. For CY2023, the reports forecast that the M&E industry will grow at ~12%, led by digital which is expected to grow at ~18% while TV is expected to grow at low single-digit rate.\n\n## INDIAN AD INDUSTRY\n\n(\n\n'\n\nBILLION)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDIGITAL\n\nTV\n\nPRINT\n\nRADIO + CINEMA + OOH\n\nSource: FICCI EY Report, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n## TRILLION\n\nAD SPENDS CROSSED THE MILESTONE IN CY2022, GROWING 19% Y-O-Y\n\n## OTT Advertising and Subscription to Continue Growing\n\nGiven the secular trend of increasing smartphone and internet penetration, digital medium is expected to continue its impressive growth for the foreseeable future. Within Digital, OTT is one of the fastest growing segments as increasingly more consumers are spending time consuming content on these platforms.\n\nAs per the BCG CII Report - Shaping the future of Indian M&E, the current size of the Indian OTT market is $2.6 bn and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20%-23% to reach $11-13 bn by 2030. OTT provides two options to the consumer - to consume free content which is monetised through advertising (AVOD model) or watch premium content on paying a subscription fees (SVOD model).\n\nAs per the same report, India currently has 85-90mn paid subscriptions, which is expected to nearly double to 160-165mn by 2027. Bundling of subscriptions through telecom plans and emergence of aggregator platforms is also expected to aid this growth.\n\nOTT advertising will continue to grow on the back of increasing internet-connected audience, growing time-spend and improving targeting advertising capabilities.\n\n## SIZE OF THE INDIAN OTT INDUSTRY\n\n($)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: BCG CII Report - Shaping the Future of Indian M&E\n\n## Connected TVs - A Promising Growth Opportunity\n\nInternet-connected mobile phones have been the primary driver for the massive growth in digital content consumption, responsible for nearly 90% of this growth. However, the engagement levels on big screens (TV) continue to be much higher than handsets. Connected TVs (CTV) o/uniFB00er the best features of both traditional and digital eco-system - a large screen size and ability for targeted advertising, thus providing an opportunity to brands to reach premium audiences in an intelligent fashion. Due to a low penetration of CTVs, advertising on the medium is currently at a nascent stage in India, at just over 1% of total TV spends.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCAGR CTV AD SPENDS IN INDIA 2022-2027\n\nSource: Groupm TYNY Report, 2023\n\n## New Tari/uniFB00 Order Finally Clears Legal Hurdles\n\nAfter being mired in multiple litigation challenges for more than two years, the New Tari/uniFB00 Order was cleared for implementation after the regulatory body, TRAI, amended the regulation post an industry-wide consultation process.\n\nThe proposal to lower the price ceiling for including a channel in a bouquet to ' 12 was dropped, reverting to the earlier price limit of ' 19. Another key proposal to introduce a discount cap of 33% on the bouquet price vis a vis a-la-carte price was modified, with the discount limit increased to 45%. While a few appeals were filed against the new regulation by some distribution platforms, it was implemented in February 2023.\n\nHowever, with the fast-increasing adoption of CTVs in India, it is expected that advertising spends on the platform will also follow suit. The growth in CTV revenue is also expected to be driven by subscription, fuelled by the investments in high quality digital content. This is likely to further accelerate the adoption of CTV, as viewers seek out big-screen experience for the premium content.\n\n## CTV ADVERTISING SPENDS FORECAST\n\n($ MILLION)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key Hindi General Entertainment Channels moved out of the DD Freedish Platform\n\nAt the beginning of the year, all the major broadcasters took their FTA channels o/uniFB00 DD Freedish distribution platform. This had an impact on viewership, up to 90% for some of these channels, as they run older content which doesn't get much viewership on pay platforms.\n\nSubsequently, it also impacted the ad revenue growth for these channels and the networks. However, it has helped to slow down the loss of pay-TV subscribers, an issue which has a/uniFB00ected the industry since the implementation of the New Tari/uniFB00 Order (NTO) in early 2019, followed\n\nby the pandemic a year later. Given that the quality of content on these channels is superior to most of the other content available on the FTA platform, it provides an incentive for consumers to upgrade and become pay subscribers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These European sanctions further led to re-routing of global crude and product trade flows.\n\nGlobal oil demand continued to rise in FY 2022-23 despite being impacted by high oil prices, China's Covid lockdowns during the first half of the year, and global economic growth concerns during the second half of the year.\n\nInternational air travel rose steadily throughout the year as most countries lifted restrictions with covid related concerns receding. Global refinery operations also increased on support of rising demand. Improving mobility and gas to oil switching, amid high natural gas prices, also supported oil demand growth during the year.\n\nTightening of monetary policy by Central Banks caused concerns on economic recovery leading to sharp drop in oil prices in March 2023.\n\n## Crude Oil Demand and Supply\n\nGlobal Oil demand in CY 2022 increased by 2.3 mb/d to 99.8 mb/d.\n\nHigh oil prices and China Covid lockdowns limited oil demand growth in the year. However, demand growth\n\nwas supported by improving mobility, rising air travel demand, increasing use of oil for power generation and gas to oil switching in the industrial sector.\n\nGlobal oil supply increased by 4.5 mb/d to 99.9 mb/d in CY 2022. Oil supply growth was strong in the year in both OPEC and Non-OPEC countries. OPEC supply growth was led by Saudi Arabia, UAE and Iraq. Non-OPEC supply growth was led by US.\n\n## Global Refining Operations\n\nDuring FY 2022-23, Global refinery operations increased steadily on the back of strong demand, high refinery margins and also due to start-up\n\nof new refineries in Middle East, US and China.\n\nIn CY 2022, global refinery throughput was 1.9 mb/d higher than in CY 2021. Overall refinery utilisation reached 82% by March 23. Refiners increased run rates to take advantage of the higher product cracks.\n\nRefining margins were strong in FY 2022-23 as concerns of loss of Russian product exports to Europe due to sanctions led to huge disruption in global trade flows. Margins were healthy in the year mainly due to strong middle distillate cracks amid rising fuel demand and lower global inventories.\n\n## GLOBAL REFINERY CRUDE THROUGHPUT\n\n(MB/D)\n\n|                   |   CY 2022 |   CY 2021 | Change   2022 vs. 2021   |\n|-------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| OECD Americas     |      18.7 |      17.7 | 1.0                      |\n| OECD Europe       |      11.5 |      11   | 0.5                      |\n| China             |      13.7 |      14.4 | (0.7)                    |\n| Rest of the World |      36.6 |      35.5 | 1.1                      |\n| World Total       |      80.5 |      78.6 | 1.9                      |\n\nSource: IEA\n\n## Crude Oil, LNG and Ethane Prices\n\n## Oil Prices\n\nCrude oil prices rose sharply in FY 2022-23 with Brent price averaging $96.2/ bbl in the year. Higher crude oil prices during February 2022 to August 2022 were mainly on account of war premium as an after e/uniFB00ect of Russia Ukraine conflict. Brent oil rose to high levels of $123.7/bbl in June 2022 amid rising demand and on concerns of impact of upcoming EU embargo on Russian oil imports from\n\nDecember 2022. However, Oil prices started to cool down after June 2022 as US increased SPR oil sales and Russia was able to divert much of its crude oil exports from Europe to Asia.\n\nOil price volatility continued through the year with Brent oil prices falling to $81.1/ bbl in December 2022 on recessionary concerns while Russian oil exports remained resilient.

Asian LNG prices averaged at $32.96/MMBtu in FY 2022-23.\n\nGeopolitical tensions reduced pipeline gas flow from Russia to Europe leading to decrease in European inventories by Q1 2022. Also, significant outages at LNG terminals like USA, Australia, Malaysia tightened LNG availability during FY 2022-23.\n\nIn anticipation of the winter season, despite a tight LNG market, Europe\n\n## LNG PRICES\n\n(US$/MMBtu)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Reuters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nacquired an additional 45 MT of LNG over and above their 2021 volume to substitute Russian pipeline gas to build inventory.\n\nThese events resulted in significant increase in LNG prices during Q2 2022. However, high LNG prices and tight COVID restrictions in China led to demand destruction in Asia (7%) and Europe (13%).\n\nIn addition, the relatively mild winter experienced in Europe and Asia resulted in sustained high inventories towards the end of winter 2022, which subsequently contributed to reduction of LNG prices by March 2023.\n\n## Ethane Prices\n\nIn February 2023, Reliance completed six years of ethane value chain project.\n\nThe ethane chain acted as a virtual pipeline from US to India ensuring uninterrupted ethane supply to our crackers and providing them feedstock security, flexibility and a unique competitive advantage.\n\nDuring the year, ethane prices were highly volatile, seeing a high of 68.0 US cents per gallon (cpg) in June 2022 and a low of 22.7 cpg in February 2023. As ethane prices moved in tandem with natural gas prices for most of the year, prices peaked in anticipation of strong winter and low inventory levels. However, the Freeport LNG terminal shutdown, rising interest rates and milder winter eased ethane prices.\n\n## Transportation Fuels\n\n## Global Market Environment\n\nGlobal gasoline demand growth remained steady during the year on rising mobility. In CY 2022, demand recovered to 97.5% of pre-pandemic levels (CY 2019 levels) to 26.0 mb/d as restrictions on mobility were lifted gradually by various countries. China lifted Covid related mobility restrictions in December 2022.\n\nGlobal diesel demand was strong during the year due to improving economy and rising industrial activity. In CY 2022, diesel demand recovered to pre-pandemic levels to reach 28.3 mb/d.\n\nJet fuel demand gradually increased through the year. It recovered to 78% of pre-pandemic levels in CY 2022 to 6.2 mb/d amid slow recovery in business and international travel.\n\n## Domestic Market Environment\n\nIndian transportation fuel market has bounced back completely to register new highs across both HSD and MS segment in FY 2022-23. Despite being significantly below pre-covid levels, ATF volumes have shown the steepest growth.\n\n## INDIA FUEL CONSUMPTION TREND (EXIT QUARTER TREND) (MMT)\n\n| Product   |   Q4 FY 2019-20 |   Q4 FY 2020-21 |   Q4 FY 2021-22 |   Q4 FY 2022-23 |\n|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| HSD       |            19.7 |            20.6 |            20.6 |            22   |\n| MS        |             7.1 |             7.8 |             7.9 |             8.7 |\n| ATF       |             1.9 |             1.4 |             1.4 |             2   |\n\nWith this being the first complete year since FY 2020-21 without any specific (pandemic led or otherwise) demand disruption in the country, there has been healthy growth of petroleum products in the country despite elevated retail selling prices.\n\nIndia's oil demand grew by 10.2% and stood at 222.3 MMT. LPG demand also maintained an upward growth trajectory.\n\nStrong economic traction is reflected in the double-digit growth demonstrated by gasoil and gasoline with demand for both fuels surpassing peak demand levels of pre-pandemic times. While gasoil demand has grown\n\nby 12%, gasoline has grown back at 13% on Y-o-Y basis.\n\nDespite the slowdown concerns of previous year, both state-owned oil marketing companies and private players have continued expanding their network, adding over 4,000 outlets in FY 2022-23, and taking the total number of retail outlets in India to over 90,000.\n\nBuoyant economic activity in the country, consistent growth in 2w and 4w sales, continued enhancement of road infrastructure and increase in retail outlet network augurs well for maintaining the momentum in transportation fuels demand growth in the country over the coming decade.\n\nThe average price of ethane for FY 2022-23 was 44.4 cpg.

This is on the back of unleashing of pent-up travel demand both within India and outside due to lockdown concerns over the last few years. That the growth is coming despite churn and consolidation amongst the airline players augurs well for sustained growth of Indian Aviation sector.\n\n## Margins\n\nGasoline margins rose to $14.7/ bbl in FY 2022-23 from $11.4/bbl in FY 2021-22 backed by steady demand growth and improving mobility.

This was mainly due to higher price realisation along with increase in the gas production as compared to FY 2021-22.\n\n## INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n2022 was another volatile year for global oil markets on account of unprecedented challenges. At the start of the year, strong oil demand growth was expected as the economy continued its recovery from the global pandemic. However, Russia-Ukraine conflict introduced huge geopolitical uncertainties and caused energy prices to soar.\n\nGlobal oil demand in CY 2022 grew over 2 million b/d from 2021 but remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe Brent crude oil price averaged $96.2/bbl in FY 2022-23 and the WTI spot price averaged $95/bbl. Oil prices rose significantly in the first half of 2022 due to geopolitical tension but declined in the second half of the year.\n\n|                     | FY 2022-23   | FY 2021-22   | % change Y-o-Y   |\n|---------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Revenue ( '  crore) | 16,508       | 7,492        | 120.3%           |\n| EBITDA ( '  crore)  | 13,589       | 5,457        | 149.0%           |\n| EBITDA margin (%)   | 82.3%        | 72.8%        | 950 bps          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNatural gas witnessed record high prices in 2022 due to steep decline in Russian piped gas supply to Europe, higher gas burn in the power sector and strong storage injections. Europe TTF spot prices averaged a record high of $38/MMBtu in 2022 while Henry Hub prices averaged $6/MMBtu, their highest level since 2008. Asian spot LNG prices also averaged $32.96/MMBtu for FY 2022-23 which is highest level on record.\n\nRecord high gas prices led to an unprecedented reduction in gas demand in industry in 2022. Gas consumption declined by an estimated 2% in Asia and 13% in Europe (over 70 BCM). United States experienced growth of 5.4% in gas\n\nconsumption largely due to colder than average temperatures during the heating season.\n\nLNG demand was dominated by a sharp surge in gross LNG imports into Europe, which was balanced by a steep decline in the rest of the world, particularly in Asia. LNG supply growth was relatively modest in 2022 at 5.5%, despite an unprecedented rise in LNG demand in Europe following the gradual decline in Russian pipeline gas deliveries throughout the year.\n\nThe Govt. of India appointed Dr. Kirit Parikh Committee to review domestic natural gas pricing. The Committee recommended removal of price ceiling on gas produced from High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT) fields from January 1, 2026.",

The three integrated projects - R Cluster, Satellite Cluster and MJ - have been leveraging the existing hub infrastructure in place by utilising existing production facilities and thus reducing costs.\n\nIn FY 2022-23, on back of higher production and improved price realisation, the business delivered a robust performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n~30\n\nMMSCMD\n\nEXPECTED GAS PRODUCTION IN FY 2023-24\n\n## KG D6\n\n## Deepwater Production Update\n\nRIL successfully and safely delivered R Cluster & Satellite Cluster projects in the KG D6 Block during the peak COVID times.\n\nCurrently both the fields together are producing about 20 MMSCMD gas and contributing ~20% to India's gas production.\n\n## MJ Deepwater Development Update\n\nMJ Field has started producing gas and condensate from 1Q FY 2023-24. All o/uniFB00shore installation and commissioning works have been completed. Floating Production Storage and O/uniFB04oading (FPSO) is at the field. Drilling and completion of wells is in progress.\n\nIncremental gas production from MJ field, combined with gas production from R Cluster and Satellite Cluster fields, is expected to deliver ~30 MMSCMD in FY 2023-24.\n\nCombined production from these three projects is expected to enhance India's energy security in volatile market environment. With the incremental production from MJ field, KG D6 block is expected to contribute around 30% of India's gas production.\n\n## Exploration Strategy\n\nBlock KGUDWHP-2018/ (KG-UDW1) was awarded to RIL-BP JV under OALP II licensing round and Petroleum Exploration License (PEL) was issued in August 2019.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic and related challenges, the 3D Seismic Acquisition and Processing campaign was completed in the Block. Currently Seismic data interpretation and prospect maturation is ongoing, post which first exploration well is planned to be drilled in the Block.\n\n## Abandonment\n\nD1 D3 Field ceased production in February 2020, following which the Oil Industry Safety Directorate (OISD) and Management Committee (MC) have approved the permanent Plug & Abandonment (P&A) of wells and in-situ abandonment of the associated equipment. P&A of one well in the D1 D3 field has been completed in FY 2022-23. Procurement of Rig & Services to complete P&A of the balance wells in the D1 D3 field is ongoing.\n\nFollowing cessation of production in 2018, MA Field was decommissioned, Hydrocarbon freeing of flexible flowlines and flushing of umbilicals was completed and FPSO was demobilised. The flexible flowlines, dynamic flexibles dynamic umbilicals, subsea structures, mooring lines and STP buoy have been decommissioned. In FY 2022-23, P&A Activities have been completed in all wells in accordance with the Field Decommissioning Plan approved by the OISD and the MC.\n\n## Coal Bed Methane\n\nRIL is currently producing Coal Bed Methane (CBM) from its block SP (West)-CBM-2001/1. More than 300 wells are in production with an average output of 0.73 MMSCMD gas during the year.\n\nTo sustain plateau production further CBM development is being undertaken in blocks SP (West)CBM-2001/1 and SP (East)-CBM2001/1.\n\nReliance Gas Pipeline Limited, a subsidiary of RIL, operates the 302 km Shahdol-Phulpur Pipeline from Shahdol (MP) to Phulpur (UP) connecting the CBM Gas fields with the National Gas Grid, thus providing access to consumers across the country.\n\n## Update on Arbitrations and Other Legal Issues\n\n## KG D6 Cost Recovery Arbitration\n\nArbitration claim commenced by the Company in November 2011 seeking declaration that it is entitled to recover 100% of its contract costs under the Production Sharing Contracts (PSC) for the KG D6 Block. The matter is at the stage of Final Hearing as part of arbitration proceedings. Government of India has filed an application before the Arbitration Tribunal alleging that majority of the Tribunal members are biased and cannot continue hearing the dispute. The Arbitration Tribunal has reserved its decision on Government's bias application.\n\n## Public Interest Litigations (PILs)\n\nThree PILs were filed before the Supreme Court in 2013 against the Company in relation to the KG D6 PSC, seeking reliefs in the nature of disallowance of cost recovery, quashing GOI's decision to approve certain gas price formula and termination of PSC. The Company has submitted that the underlying issues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin the PILs are already subject matter of ongoing arbitrations relating to the KG D6 Block. Matter is still pending in the Supreme Court.\n\n## PMT Arbitration\n\nArbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) against the Government of India (GOI) on December 16, 2010 under PSCs, for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to di/uniFB00erence in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and Government.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on October 12, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on April 16, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated October 1, 2018 ('2018 FPA').\n\nThe Government and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected Government's challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants'\n\nchallenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable award on January 29, 2021 ('EPOD Agreements Case Award').\n\nGovernment challenged the EPOD Agreements Case Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on June 9, 2022 by Judge, Sir Ross Cranston. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice.\n\nArbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of Claimants' request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nThe Government has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The Claimants contend that Government's Execution Petition is not maintainable.",

This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company's fact witnesses in the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\n\n## Arbitration Relating to Alleged Migration Of Gas\n\nGOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on November 4, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately $1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. RIL, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated July 24, 2018 upheld\n\nContractor's claims. GOI filed an appeal on November 15, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nVide Judgment dated May 9, 2023, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award dated July 24, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI's appeal challenging the Award.\n\n## Writ Petition Filed Against FIR in Anti-Corruption Bureau\n\nIn 2014, four individuals filed a complaint with the Chief Minister of the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi alleging collusion between the then Ministers of the Central Government and the Company in relation to increasing the price of gas produced by the Company from the KG D6 Block. The Chief Minister of Delhi had ordered the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to register the first information report (FIR) and investigate the matter.\n\nThe Company has filed a Writ Petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court questioning the jurisdiction of the ACB in registering the case against the Company. The Company has contended that the ACB lacks jurisdiction to file the case. The matter is currently pending before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court.\n\n## New Technologies\n\nRIL is engaged in R&D e/uniFB00orts to increase recovery from CBM fields. The current focus of this research is Bio-CBM.\n\nThe Bio-CBM technology uses microbe injection to produce in-situ methane in places where either the coals are devoid of methane or conventional CBM extraction is uneconomical.\n\nSeveral microbial consortia were isolated from various locations within India and screened for methane production potential. The best consortium was optimised under bottle and scale up conditions. Besides this, the commercially available coal specific synthetic consortia were evaluated and have shown very high methane productivity\n\nTo mimic some of the field conditions, a core flood reactor was designed and built. The isolated microbial consortia as well as the synthetic consortia were tested successfully for their ability to produce methane under low porosity and highpressure conditions in this reactor. Other variables such as coal size, recirculation of media and nutrient augmentation were also tested successfully in the core flood reactor.\n\nLab tests and preliminary field trials have shown encouraging results with respect to methane production potential. Research work is underway to establish ability of this technology to scale up to a commercial operation.\n\nRIL is leveraging its infrastructure (advance laboratories), requisite diverse inter-disciplinary technical skills, CBM production expertise, CBM fields and knowledge of regulatory requirements to give impetus to the BioCBM research.\n\n## RIL KG D6 CSR ACTIVITIES 2022-23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reliance Dhirubhai Ambani Protsaham\n\nSince 2010, under the Reliance Dhirubhai Ambani Protsaham scheme, RIL has been assisting local students for admission into well-established junior colleges in Kakinada. 130 poor meritorious students were selected under this scheme for the academic year 2022-23.\n\n## Facilitating Quality Education\n\nAll schools were provided with teaching aids, computer systems and trained the school teachers for e/uniFB00ective teaching.\n\nAdditionally, educational kit comprising of two pairs of uniform, shoes, and notebooks has been providing to around 2,000 students.\n\n## Education\n\n## Newly constructed classrooms\n\nOn the request of authorities, new classrooms constructed in Gadimoga High School to cater to the needs of increasing number of school going children.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Medical Camps and Health Awareness Programmes\n\nTo create awareness on basic health, sanitation & hygiene, RIL conducted mega medical camp at Primary Health Centre (PHC), Gadimoga. 330 patients were examined by specialist doctors.

Global warming is having a compounding e/uniFB00ect on the climate system, resulting in increased humanitarian challenges and further straining already stretched fiscal balances.\n\nFor businesses, climate change risks manifests in two broader categories, namely physical and transition risks, as outlined by global frameworks. Physical risks refer to the potential impacts on a company caused by both short-term extreme weather events (acute) and long-term changes in climate patterns (chronic). On the other hand, transition risks pertain to the potential hazards businesses may face as the world transitions to a lower-carbon energy system which includes risks due to policy changes, legal action, technological advancements, shifts in supply and demand, and changes in stakeholder attitudes.\n\n## Physical Risk\n\nThroughout the year, an array of climate change induced weather events was experienced around the globe and in India too. These calamities included extreme weather events like intense heatwaves, cyclones, erratic rainfall, floods, and others, a/uniFB00ecting almost every region of the country and causing unprecedented levels of destruction. Having a wide geographical spread, the organisation is susceptible to such erratic weather phenomenon which could cause disruptions in its operations and supply chains, in addition to causing negative impact on the wellbeing of our people and our assets.\n\nAdditionally, long term changes in climate patterns causing rising temperatures and sea levels may also expose our operations to future impacts of worsening climate change, which can impact our business continuity in certain vulnerable regions.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance has robust business continuity management plans to manage risks arising from the physical impacts of climate change events. Each business segment after thorough evaluation of risks and its impact, develops these plans to ensure uninterrupted availability or swift recovery of essential business processes, resources and\n\noperations. Regular review and testing are undertaken to ensure the e/uniFB00ectiveness.\n\nThe Global Corporate Security (GCS) team focuses on adopting pre-emptive, de-risking strategies to safeguard and secure operations from disasters, natural calamities, and any other disruptions or incidents at RIL. Digital Services has established an integrated process for Disaster Recovery and Emergency Response to ensure network functionality and uninterrupted customer services. Retail has also developed comprehensive plans for disaster recovery and incident response to guarantee business continuity during any potential disruptions or incidents.\n\n## Transition Risk\n\n## Risks Related to Policies, Law and Regulations\n\nDriven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and the urgency to act on climate change, a new global energy order is emerging - leading to a shift in the way energy is produced and consumed. This gradual move away from fossil fuels is prompting an increased focus on developing policies, incentives and regulatory frameworks that can bolster the adoption of low-carbon technologies and green products - which may impact the demand for RIL's current products. Additionally, the envisaged development of a domestic carbon market regime and thereby the likely introduction of stricter regulations related to GHG emissions may impact RIL's operating costs.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nWith the increasing number of customers embracing clean energy and materials, the demand for conventional products is likely to reduce, which may potentially impact the company's revenue and profits.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nThe Company has integrated climate-related issues into its strategic planning, investment reviews, risk management processes, and long-range supply and demand forecasts. As reflected in its adoption of a long-term perspective on the transition to green energy, Reliance has set a bold and forward-looking vision to establish itself as a leading global player in the New Energy and New Materials industry. The company's 15-year plan entails a multi-pronged approach to creating sustainable energy sources and futuristic materials for India's future, while advancing the development of cutting-edge technologies to convert CO 2 emissions into useful products,\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance continues to focus on energy management and resource optimisation to reduce its carbon footprint through adoption of data analytics, advanced process controls and optimisation models. It is proactively shifting its dependence on fossil fuels to renewable alternatives like solar, biomass etc. to meet its captive energy demand. The Company also has plans to establish 20 GW of solar energy generation capacity by 2025, which will be consumed for captive round-theclock (RTC) power and will also serve as intermittent energy for Green Hydrogen production.\n\nReliance is committed to scaling up responsible consumption practices and maximising circularity across its value chain through sustained investments in R&D of innovative technologies and solutions. By keeping resources in use for longer, our circular business models can help to reduce the demand for new raw materials and the associated carbon emissions from their extraction, transportation and processing. These initiatives are enabling us to minimise our impact on the environment and thereby mitigate the regulatory risks that may arise from a high carbon liability.\n\nuse CO 2 as feedstock and develop next-gen carbon capture and storage technologies, in line with its focus on sustainability and innovation.\n\nWith a plan to invest around H 75,000 crore over a span of 3 years, Reliance aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Establish and enable 100 GW of solar energy by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Build five Giga factories namely the integrated solar photovoltaic module factory, an advanced energy storage battery factory, an electrolyser factory, a fuel cell factory, and a power electronics factory, thereby creating an integrated, end-to-end renewable energy ecosystem.\n- \u00b7 Partner with leading companies globally in Solar, Battery, and Electrolyser space.\n- \u00b7 Focus on bioenergy, o/uniFB00shore wind, and other non-conventional sources.\n- \u00b7 Maximise crude to chemicals integration and create a portfolio of advanced and speciality materials.\n- \u00b7 Transform RIL's business into Net Carbon Zero operations.\n\nOnce proven at scale, RIL is prepared to double the investment to scale up its manufacturing ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, Reliance is also engaging in R&D initiatives and taking concrete measures to enable transformation in its value chain. For instance, RIL along with Ashok Leyland developed this unique technology of India's first Hydrogen Internal Combustion Engine (H2-ICE) powered heavy duty truck.\n\nThrough these strategic initiatives, RIL aims to not only mitigate the negative impacts of climate change, but also position itself as a reputable leader in green energy business. The company's green energy transition underscores its commitment to address evolving customer demands for a sustainable future, as well as its dedication to responsible corporate citizenship.",

Failure to meet these expectations could lead to damage to the company's reputation, which could impact RIL's ability to access capital, as well as to attract and retain talent.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance is leveraging the expertise and experience of its New Energy Council (NEC), a group of leading global technocrats and thought leaders, to accelerate its transition to clean energy. NEC is enabling creation of a strong foundation to realise\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance is closely monitoring the progress of its Net Carbon Zero by 2035 target including realisation of its near-term targets. We have set interim timelines for significant milestones across various initiatives within the New Energy business. A dedicated ESG committee has been instituted at the group level to facilitate supervision over the implementation and review of crucial initiatives, with the aim of ensuring progress towards the attainment of our Net Carbon Zero goals.\n\n## Commodity Prices and Markets\n\nImpact on:\n\nour vision of New Energy business - its strategic advice on innovative technologies and partnerships will help us mitigate the risks posed in these novel areas.\n\nFurther, the company recognises the significance of e/uniFB00ective stakeholder engagement, particularly in relation to its climate change goals and believes that ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders is essential to ensure alignment with the company's objectives for a sustainable future.\n\nWith focus on research and technological innovation, strong fundamentals and deep understanding and knowledge of chemistry and materials that adds to our competitive edge. Reliance is well positioned to manage, risks while creating opportunities in the coming decades.\n\n, Oil to Chemicals & Retail business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Description\n\nThe Russia Ukraine conflict and consequent US and EU sanctions on Russian crude oil, product and natural gas exports have the potential for creating shortages of crude oil and products and driving up prices. This can impact the availability of crude oil and cause a spike in price of feedstock.\n\nThe high energy inflation could lead to headwinds for the global economy a/uniFB00ecting oil demand and refining margins.\n\nThere was unforeseen market scenario with a disruption of energy sources and oil supply mainly in the western regions due to geo-political developments between neighbouring countries of Ukraine and Russia. This has resulted in a shift in sourcing of energy and oil from alternate destinations, which has led to change in the trade-flows worldwide.\n\nThe resultant longer sea passage has created shortage of availability of tankers and thus historically high volatility in freight rates.\n\nFurther, the phased embargoes of Russian products that has come into place has created challenges which are likely to continue to be more complex for transportation of food and energy worldwide.\n\nNon availability of goods at right price, quality and quantity can adversely a/uniFB00ect our retail business. There are several variables that may impact procurement decisions such as stock limits imposed by Government, adverse monsoon which may impact commodity prices, international geo-political events such as Russia - Ukraine war.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nRIL's strategy has been to source feedstocks from diverse sources to ensure supply security. Accordingly, RIL has long term contracts with various Middle East National Oil Companies, African and Latin American countries. It has also entered into term contracts with Canadian companies to source heavy crude oil.\n\nReliance has a robust ship tanker fleet, which is suitable to trade worldwide. This set of time charter ships was optimally and proactively utilised along with ships from the spot markets achieving smooth and timely cargo evacuation and by limiting exposure to freight cost.\n\nThe liquid tanker shipping markets has never seen such demand before. The challenge was to find suitable ships at commercially viable cost. This was managed by tight monitoring of the time charter ships multiple scheduling until the last minute for the best and optimum route for the time charter ships, while ensuring nil downtime (100% utilisation) basis ship and cargo availability and at the same time fulfilling the contractual commitment to the customers.\n\nMinute planning and close coordination between the teams of Business, Operations and Chartering achieved this complex task.\n\n## Customer Experience and Retention\n\nReliance Retail undertakes a detailed analysis of the macro-economic situation and proactively maintains and tracks market intelligence on geopolitical/economic policies shaping up in the global market. Continuous interactions and engagement with di/uniFB00erent stakeholders like brokers, traders and monitoring commodity exchange trades gives business the right impetus to carefully plan and de-risk itself against the external factors. We have internal controls and processes to ensure we procure optimum quantities at competitive prices in the market and also have wide base of vendors across geographies for each of the goods we procure.\n\nImpact on:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n, All Businesses\n\n## Risk Description\n\nDigital Services being a customer oriented business, any sub-optimal customer experience may result in customer dissatisfaction and increased chances of churn.\n\nEvolving habits and changing customer preferences could weaken our value proposition and in turn could lead to low loyalty and repeat purchases from customers.\n\nReliance Retail could lose customers or incur liability for any injuries su/uniFB00ered by customers which can impact our reputation and financial performance.\n\nCompetition from other oil marketing companies poses risk of customer retention as the country is surplus in petroleum products. Certain sanctions and embargoes on export of petroleum products to some countries may also pose a risk.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nFor sustained customer experience at Digital business, following measures are adopted:\n\n- \u00b7 Superior usage and billing experience\n- \u00b7 Anytime, anywhere mobile and wireline broadband network access\n- \u00b7 Best-in-class customer service backed by technologies like AI, Bots and app based QRC (Query Resolution Complaints) process\n- \u00b7 Competitive tari/uniFB00 pricing\n- \u00b7 Agile service model adopted to develop systems and platforms\n- \u00b7 Enhancing customer experience with localised support\n- \u00b7 Structured process of measuring Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) across all touchpoints.\n\nCustomer engagement remains robust with strong gross additions of subscribers, significant increase in net MNP subscribers and increase in per capita data usage. The Company has also invested in newer technologies start-up's such as AI / ML, Blockchain, BoT, Speech / NLP, Metaverse, Mobility & 5G network, Robotics, Cloud & Edge computing etc. Use of these technologies will further enhance customer experience and value proposition.\n\nReliance Retail remains abreast on the trends in consumer preferences taking place in Indian and global markets. Its deep consumer understanding helps in designing and developing trendy and relevant products to cater to the dynamic needs of its consumers.\n\nReliance Retail is consumer centric organisation and has adopted a\n\nstringent policy of taking cognisance of 'CUSTOMER SAFETY' as topmost value and priority. Rigorous quality checks and all safety norms are adhered to at all times.\n\nOn the customer complaints front, the business has placed a dedicated 'Customer Service' team that handles all queries routed through emails, voice calls, chats, social media etc. This has ensured faster resolutions and enabled retention of our end consumers.\n\nEnsuring timely deliveries, quality assurance, e/uniFB03cient logistic solutions, pricing options, etc. at competitive prices reduce the risk of customer loss in oil to chemicals business. Diversified customer profile across various geographical regions provides alternative markets for our products thereby reducing risks arising from sanctions.",

This data is consumed and used by businesses for providing customised experiences, helping shape new business models and driving a customer-centric service environment in this competitive market. This also brings challenges to organisations in ethically handling such data. The rising number of data breaches is the greatest concern for organisations of every size and scale.\n\nDue to the large-scale digitisation and expansion of B2C businesses, the handling of personal data of customers, consumers, employees, partners, and service providers transparently and securely becomes of utmost importance. Improper handling and inadequate data protection practices may lead to data breaches and non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nConstant training and skilling initiatives along with a rigorous development regime empowers our businesses to have the right set of people at the right place and at the right time.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance recognises the importance of Data privacy and safeguarding personal data is one of the top priorities at Reliance. Data privacy principles are followed across the lifecycle of personal data to address data privacy risks.\n\nReliance ensures all its business processes follow the privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default approach and makes sure that the personal data is used ethically and legally. Adequate control measures are implemented for\n\n## Cybersecurity Risk\n\nthe protection of the personal data of individuals collected, processed, and stored by RIL.\n\nData Privacy processes are formalised across all businesses.

Digital transformation is thus an ongoing activity in Reliance. The pace of digital transformation has been increasing over the years. One of the consequences of such rapid digital transformation is the expansion of cyber-attack surfaces. Cybersecurity risk is thus emerging as one of the prominent business risks.\n\nCybercrime and Cyber Insecurity is considered as one of the severe global risks as per the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 2023 making it clear that cyber risks will remain a constant and significant concern over the next decade. Cyber Attacks today are more sophisticated, persistent, and disruptive in nature. Geo-political influences are magnifying the risks to critical infrastructure. Adversaries are leveraging emerging technologies such as AI etc. to initiate cyber-attacks on organisations that typically evade the existing defenses.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance has adopted an approach of being proactive and at the same time being resilient to manage cyber risk. The Cyber Security strategy defined at Reliance is based on Mark to Threat and is aligned to business as well as technology.\n\nSecurity by design principle and shift left strategy is followed across the lifecycle of the digital platforms to ensure that cyber security controls are part of the design. The cyber-attack surface is continuously monitored to identify vulnerabilities or misconfigurations and identified weaknesses are fixed on priority.\n\nContemporary and state-of-the-art security technologies and processes are deployed for protection against emerging attacks at multiple layers. Intelligence-driven Cyber Defense\n\noperations are performed for proactive threat detection. Rapid response playbooks are in place and updated regularly for cyber incident management.\n\nThird-party risk management processes are in place to manage and minimise the impact of supply chain attacks.\n\nAt RIL, special attention is paid to Cyber Security awareness and to foster a culture of Cyber security as humans have turned out to be the best defenses to combat cyber threats. Innovative solutions such as R-phish are deployed to improve user awareness levels by tracking their Phishing Resistance Score levels.\n\nCybersecurity awareness month is observed every year with a\n\ncontext-based campaign. The context for this year was 'Fostering a culture of cyber security'. During this month we have also released a 'Cyber Suraksha Handbook' for all the users. This handbook acts as a guide to stay safe online in the digital era and contains cyber safety guidelines for Work Place, Digital Life, teens and kids, and protection of Personal data.\n\nCyber Security practices followed at RIL are benchmarked against Industry Best standards such as NIST, ISO 27001, etc. RIL's O2C and Retail businesses are ISO 27001 certified whereas Retail and RBML businesses have attained PCI DSS certification.

These risks may manifest during various phases of facility life cycle and vary in the magnitude depending on the geographic, demographic and regulatory regimes where we operate. Risks may also present themselves through external factors with an impact to company's personnel and assets, like external events in the neighbouring industries and natural calamities.\n\nWith rapid-changes in the HSE regulatory requirement due to evolving global trends, changes in legal and regulatory framework, ask from investors, and customer awareness, it is compelling to stay abreast of these requirements for smooth operations and business continuity. The health risk is not only restricted to occupational health but also covers mental health of the workforce. The environment regulations are evolving, and becoming stringent for businesses due to risk of global warming and climate change risk. Safety risk is not only restricted to site operations but also require to capture risk across the upstream and downstream supply chain for business continuity.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nReliance's motto of 'Growth is Life' has always been reinforced with our commitment on conducting safe, reliable, compliant and sustainable operations.\n\nThere has been a continuous endeavour to manage risks across our existing assets at Exploration & Production, Refining & Marketing, Petrochemicals, Polyester and other dispersed facilities through world-class HSE management practices. Implementation of advanced technologies like video analytics, robotics, remote-sensing devices for inspection have reduced personnel exposure to hazardous environment.\n\nOur People are our critical assets in managing HSE risks. We have invested significant e/uniFB00orts in\n\ndeveloping and maintaining in-house competencies which are critical to manage Safety, including managing Integrity Operating Window, advanced techniques of risk assessment, deep-dive technical analysis techniques and functional safety. This talent pool helps execute risk and control studies and provides assurance with agility, while leveraging industry expertise.\n\nOur HSE risks and controls are maintained through digital platforms enabling traceability and transparency of information to all concerned workforce for e/uniFB00ective prioritisation and decision making.\n\nOur involvement in regulatory bodies in setting HSE standards and participation in international and\n\nnational HSE forums further aids in imbibing High Value Learnings in conducting our operations. Reliance's strong framework of auditing, assurance and third-party verification ensures e/uniFB00ective governance of these practices.\n\nWith the diversification of operations towards Oil to Chemicals and New Energy, this year presented new opportunities to embed HSE management best practices in the novel technologies since the conceptual stage itself. This involved strategic partnerships with industry experts, application of scientific methods to analyse the risks in the new units and devising advanced technologies for risk mitigation.\n\nOur flagship CASHE program has seen continuity for 20 th year with massive involvement of asset facing teams and entire workforce in execution of ideas to improve Safety, Health and Environment.\n\nHealth of workforce including mental well-being has been a priority, with programmes organised through internal and external experts to provide support to workforce operating across locations.\n\nHealth and Safety Management System (HSMS) is developed and deployed with robust governance\n\nmechanism with an aim to identify, assess, respond and monitor, on a real-time basis, risks that impact business objectives.\n\nThe Retail Health and safety management system (HSMS) has been certified with ISO 45001:2018, an internationally recognised standard for Occupational Health and Safety management system.

This makes Reliance vulnerable to manmade and natural disasters such as insider threat, social unrest, cyclones etc. These threats may be amplified by divisive use of social media networks. Geopolitical developments too can have a defining impact on business operations. These could cause harm to our assets, people, information and reputation.\n\nEven a seemingly minor incident has the potential to snowball and adversely impact our operations and stakeholders. Therefore, having high situational awareness with prompt and commensurate means to e/uniFB00ectively respond in a proactive manner, is required to deal with all crises. Risk management and Business continuity plans are critical to ensure that business operations are not disrupted and if compromised, we should have the ability to restore the operations at the earliest.\n\nSome of the network locations, o/uniFB03ces, employees and other ecosystems are subject to various forms of intentional or natural disruptions, thereby impacting network availability, customer experience, restoration cost and e/uniFB00orts.\n\nThe growing E-commerce business is vulnerable to specific risks like Customer abuse (fake returns, related account abuse, fake claims - as order not received, empty box, wrong item received etc.), Account compromise, Brand infringement, Phishing/Vishing attacks etc. which are likely to increase manifolds. Of these, customer abuse is probably the most critical of risks. Fraudsters continue to innovate new methods to bypass system checks on Ecom platform/physical processes to defraud. There is thus a need to closely monitor these risks and have a robust mitigation strategy to protect business interests.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nGlobal Corporate Security (GCS) focuses on adopting dynamic and pre-emptive risk management strategies to safeguard and secure the Company.\n\nGCS is responsible for securing people, assets and operations of RIL. GCS works closely with the business teams to conduct a thorough and regular assessment of all the existing and evolving risks to our operations. This is accomplished by employing the best global practices and accepted mitigation strategies to minimise the risk exposure.\n\nWe employ the best-in-class security professionals with multi-domain knowledge to draw from their vast experience.

The onset of Russia Ukraine conflict drove commodity prices and inflation higher. Major central banks embarked on liquidity tightening measures through the year as inflation spiralled. On the domestic front too, banking liquidity and financial conditions tightened. Central banks are expected to calibrate their monetary stance based on the balance of risks of continuing inflation and those of financial stability.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk\n\nReliance borrows funds from Domestic and International markets to meet its funding requirements. Faced with the scenario of spiralling inflation, central banks across the globe raised policy rates through the year. US Fed raised rates by 450 bps. RBI was also quick to respond to rising inflation in India and raised policy rates by 250 bps. The rise in global and domestic rates translates into higher finance costs for RIL.\n\n## Foreign Exchange (FX) Risk\n\nRIL avails LT and ST Foreign currency liabilities to fund its capital investments and working capital requirements. Rupee depreciation impacts the landed cost of the foreign currency liabilities. Given the steep rise in US interest rates, the Dollar remained strong against most currencies through the year. The INR depreciated sharply through first half of the year and closed the year with a depreciation of 8.4%.\n\n## Credit Risk on Investment Portfolio\n\nReliance deploys its investible surplus in Government securities, State Government securities, AAA Corporate bonds, Fixed Deposits and Debt mutual funds. Corporate bonds and Debt Mutual Fund investments bear credit risk.\n\n## Risk Response\n\nRIL maintained healthy liquidity bu/uniFB00er as it had raised Long term Senior unsecured notes of $4.0 billion in January 2022. Even as liquidity tightened through the year, RIL and its subsidiaries accessed Short Term markets comfortably and raise short term INR liabilities (including Commercial Paper, Short-Term Loans and Overdrafts against FDs) to fund its working capital requirements. Reliance's Retail business too strengthened the liquidity position by raising Term Loans to fund its capex and business requirements.\n\nInterest rate risk is managed actively by maintaining an appropriate mix of Fixed and Floating rate liabilities which limits the translation of rise in market interest rates into higher coupon costs of market liabilities.

However, the Company also believes that prompt action can provide an opportunity to create a healthier, happier, secure, and more resilient future. Consequently, Reliance advocates urgent on-ground implementation of action to move beyond dialogue and commit to the global energy transition agenda. Based on this vision, Reliance announced its ambition to become Net Carbon Zero by 2035.\n\n## The Reliance Commitment\n\nReliance is leading the way in designing decarbonisation solutions to build a sustainable future for the Company and the nation by embracing new technologies and pathways to combat climate change.

Prioritising the interests of its stakeholders allows Reliance to develop stronger relationships with them, resulting in positive business outcomes such as increased revenue, market share, and brand reputation. Reliance designs and manages a sustainable and responsible business model that recognises the significant role stakeholders play in shaping the Company's long-term success.\n\n## Materiality Approach\n\nReliance operates in dynamic environments. The Company continually assesses issues that are most material to its business and stakeholders and prioritises critical topics that need to be addressed as part of its business activities. Reliance conducted a materiality assessment for the listed entity in FY 2021-22 to identify material issues based on international reporting standards. The assessment also prioritised key internal and external stakeholders with the most impact and influence on Reliance. Relevant stakeholder engagement mechanisms were used to capture the inputs of the identified stakeholders on the potential material issues. Each potential material issue was analysed in detail, taking into account the inputs from stakeholders and management. The material topics were then prioritised based on both management and stakeholder perspectives.\n\n## Materiality Assessment Methodology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeer Benchmarking: A list of industry peers and international standards, such as GRI and SASB, were identified for benchmarking material topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholder Identification: Key internal and external stakeholder groups were identified and engaged with as part of the materiality assessment exercise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStakeholder Survey: Questionnaires were administered and responses were garnered from di/uniFB00erent stakeholder groups to understand the impacts of the probable material topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Stakeholder Response Evaluation:\n\nStakeholders' responses were collected and collated, and a detailed response analysis was completed to understand their perception of the impact of probable material topics on Reliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material Topic Prioritisation: The\n\nresult of the analysis threw up a list of material topics that were considered the most material for Reliance based on their priority and overall impact.\n\n## Key External Stakeholder Groups\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShareholders/Investors\n\nCustomers\n\nSuppliers\n\nNGOs\n\nLocal Communities\n\nGovernment Regulators\n\n## Key Internal Stakeholder Groups\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees\n\nContractual Employees\n\nSenior Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Material Topics\n\n## Matrix\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Climate Change \u2192 PAGE 175\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2 Managing Environmental Impacts \u2192 PAGE 174\n- 3 Energy E/uniFB03ciency of Operations \u2192 PAGE 179\n- 4 Water and E/uniFB04uent Management \u2192 PAGE 183\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Raw Material Security \u2192 PAGE 200\n\nEcosystem and\n\nBiodiversity\n\n\u2192 PAGE 180\n\n- 7 Innovation and Technology \u2192 PAGE 203\n- 8 Waste Management and Circular Economy\n\n\u2192 PAGE 180\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 9 Sustainable Supply Chain Management \u2192 PAGE 222\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n14\n\nDisaster Preparedness and Management\n\n\u2192 PAGE 218, 140\n\n- Health, Safety and Employee Well-being \u2192 PAGE 186\n- Diversity and Inclusion \u2192 PAGE 189\n- Customer Satisfaction \u2192 PAGE 218\n- Data Privacy and Cybersecurity \u2192 PAGE 208\n- 15 Security and Asset Management \u2192 PAGE 201\n\n16\n\n- Talent Management \u2192 PAGE 191\n- 17 Community Development \u2192 PAGE 213\n\n18\n\n- Labour Management \u2192 PAGE 195\n\n- Natural  Capital\n- Human  Capital\n- Manufactured  Capital\n- Intellectual  Capital\n- Financial  Capital\n- Social and Relationship Capital\n- Risk  Management\n- Governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n21\n\n22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n25\n\nHuman Rights\n\n\u2192 PAGE 195\n\n- Business Ethics, Integrity and Transparency\n\n\u2192 PAGE 195\n\nRegulatory Issues and\n\nCompliance\n\n\u2192 PAGE 228\n\nGrievance Redressal\n\nMechanisms\n\n\u2192 PAGE 195\n\nRisk Management\n\n\u2192 PAGE 130, 158\n\nEconomic Performance \u2192 PAGE 42\n\nCode of Conduct\n\n\u2192 PAGE 231\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Double Materiality\n\nAs a Company that strongly focuses on integrating the key concerns and needs of its stakeholders into its business and sustainability strategy, Reliance has identified double material issues. This will help Reliance evaluate the cross-impact of material issues on the environment and society against its impact on the Company. Double materiality assessment will allow the Company to recognise the impact of material issues holistically and enhance the transparency and breadth of ESG disclosures.\n\n## Material Issue and Associated Capital\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate Change\n\nReliance faces several physical and transitional risks related to climate change. Physical risks include climate-related events that can impact the Company's financial stability and value creation capabilities. Transitional risks stem from changes in the energy market as the world progresses towards a more sustainable future and embraces cleaner energy forms. Failure to adapt to these changes could lead to decreased profitability and stakeholder value and regulatory penalties.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 175\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Managing Environmental Impacts\n\nE/uniFB00ective environmental management is important for Reliance to comply with regulations, avoid legal risks, and maintain a positive reputation. It is, therefore, critical for the Company to assess potential risks associated with its operations and mitigate them by reducing emissions, minimising water use, and preventing waste and pollution. Failure to do so could result in legal action, fines, and reputational damage. Prioritising environmental sustainability demonstrates Reliance's commitment to responsible corporate citizenship, protecting brand reputation and contributing to a more sustainable future.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 174\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ecosystem and Biodiversity\n\nNon-compliance with regulations related to land use, greenfield expansions, rehabilitation and redevelopment can expose the Company to regulatory and legal risks. Hence, it becomes imperative for Reliance to work with all stakeholders and address ecosystem and biodiversity issues.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 180\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Waste Management and Circular Economy\n\nThe Company generates various forms of waste from the processing and storage of petroleum products. Many of these substances are hazardous to human health and the environment and may be subject to regulations. Reliance O2C unit reduces and recycles hazardous waste streams and has e/uniFB00ective and prompt clean-up and remediation measures to ensure seamless operations. The Company has a structured process to manage decommissioned facilities to reduce regulatory and litigation risks and associated costs.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 180\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance's O2C operations have a greater environmental impact than its Retail and Telecom businesses. Abating emissions from O2C is challenging due to the nature of its activities. Burning fossil fuels during O2C operations releases greenhouse gases (GHG), resulting in environmental impacts such as air and water pollution, habitat destruction, and the release of toxic chemicals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance's O2C business has significant environmental impacts related to GHG emissions, water use, waste generation, ecosystems and biodiversity. In addition, the O2C business can negatively impact the health and wellbeing of stakeholders, including workers, local communities, and consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance's O2C business can have a negative impact on biodiversity through various activities such as habitat fragmentation, deforestation, and erosion. This can result in the loss of habitats for wildlife, as well as cause a decline in the diversity and abundance of species.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance's O2C operations generate high volumes of hazardous waste that can negatively impact the environment and human health. Reliance Retail and Jio also generate substantial waste from the use of paper, plastic, and packaging. Appropriate waste management practices are essential to minimise their impact on people and the planet. Reliance undertakes various initiatives to reduce waste and promote sustainability across its business segments, such as recycling PET bottles and used PPEs and developing and deploying waste-to-road and waste-to-oil technology solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health, Safety and Employee Wellbeing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWorkers involved in various manufacturing activities could face significant health and safety risks due to the harsh working environments and the hazards of handling oil and gas. In addition to acute impacts resulting from accidents, workers may develop chronic health conditions. Therefore, worker health and safety performance can have an impact on Reliance's operations and profitability. RIL recognises the importance of healthy and safe working conditions as a human right, implementing a globally benchmarked HSE framework across all sites, services, and o/uniFB03ces \u2192 PAGE 186\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Talent Management\n\nReliance o/uniFB00ers peer-benchmarked monetary and nonmonetary benefits to enhance employee engagement and improve retention and productivity. Initiatives to improve employee engagement and work-life balance can positively influence the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 191\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Labour Management\n\nThe Company's significance to the economy as a major employer means that it is also often at the centre of public discussions around labour practices. Therefore, poor performance in labour relations can have serious reputational implications for the Company.\n\nCustomers regularly interact directly with employees in the Retail business. Reliance can face a decrease in market share and revenues from negative customer sentiments generated due to public disagreements between the Company and its workers.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 195\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human Rights\n\nReliance faces additional community-related risks when operating in sensitive areas to protect human rights and areas with vulnerable communities such as indigenous peoples. If Reliance is perceived to be violating human rights or failing to account for indigenous peoples' rights, the operations of the Company may be a/uniFB00ected due to protests, riots, or suspension of permits.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 195\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company's operations across business segments impact Goal 3, underlined in the UN SDGs, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote wellbeing for all.\n\nUN SDG: 3.8: Achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential healthcare services and access to safe, e/uniFB00ective, quality and a/uniFB00ordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.\n\nUN SDG: 3.9: By 2030, substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution and contamination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance has robust talent management systems to identify high-potential employees and provide opportunities for career growth and development. This helps to retain top talent, create a culture of continuous learning, and build a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce that can drive business performance and innovation. E/uniFB00ective talent management plays a crucial role in improving both employee experience and client satisfaction, which ultimately leads to higher business performance and Return on Investment for Reliance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaintaining cordial labour relations is crucial for Reliance to ensure the wellbeing and productivity of its workforce. A healthy labour relationship means that both the management and the employees are led by a common purpose, which results in improved job satisfaction, employee retention, and organisational performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVulnerable sections of the population, with limited capacity to defend their rights and interests, may need added e/uniFB00ort and support to ensure their human rights are protected. The Company's governance structures and actions can account for the same.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Business Ethics, Integrity and Transparency\n\nManaging business ethics and maintaining appropriate levels of transparency in payments to governments or individuals are significant issues for Reliance. Strong relations are critical to ensure the Company's ability to conduct business. Inappropriate action or violation of business ethics could lead to significant one-time costs or higher ongoing compliance costs. Reliance ensures compliance with all regulations and has a well-established Code of Conduct that mandates ethical business behaviour at all times. These measures o/uniFB00er adequate risk mitigation opportunities and prevent adverse outcomes.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 195\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grievance Redressal Mechanisms\n\nEstablishing e/uniFB00ective grievance redressal mechanisms is essential for Reliance to track the issues raised by stakeholders and take immediate action to resolve their concerns.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 195\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Raw Material Security\n\nThe availability of raw materials is crucial for the smooth running of Reliance's business operations. Judicious use of raw materials can have long standing impact on the Company and local economy. Raw material security provides investors and other key stakeholders confidence in the ability of the Company to run operations seamlessly. The availability of raw materials can also directly impact Reliance's ability to meet market demand for its products.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 200\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Data Privacy and Cybersecurity\n\nData breaches can result in the leakage of confidential company information. Reliance's extensive digital presence and large market share makes it a common target for such breaches. The Company has implemented several initiatives to make its technology framework secure and resilient and protect confidential assets and information.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 208\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Innovation and Technology\n\nReliance's ability to adapt to changing trends and technology has made the Company one of the most successful businesses in the country. Reliance's R&D operation is a crucial growth engine for the Company. Evolving market trends drive Reliance to develop innovative solutions and streamline existing mechanisms constantly. Innovation also accelerates organisational growth and strengthens the Company's industry leadership.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 203\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance has a well-established Code of Conduct that is applicable to its employees and the value chain, supported by strong governance structures and business practices to prevent corruption and wilful or unintentional participation in illegal or unethical payments or gifts to government o/uniFB03cials or private persons.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance has an e/uniFB00ective mechanism to address the grievances of all stakeholders, including employees, suppliers, customers and communities. This encourages stakeholders to communicate their concerns to the management and expect prompt redressal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has helped boost the socioeconomic wellbeing of several local communities through its operations across India. Raw material security can directly impact Reliance's ability to generate employment for local communities. A lack of raw material security may cause the Company to move its operations to di/uniFB00erent locations leaving behind overused/ exploited spaces for local communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nData privacy is a global concern that has increased significantly in the past few years. Access to private data and lack of digital privacy threatens the security and safety of millions of people worldwide. Reliance's digital business is susceptible to data breaches, and the Company has implemented cutting-edge security measures and complies with all applicable regulations to protect its customers' privacy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company's R&D team has a strong focus on developing sustainable solutions and alternatives to preserve the natural environment. Reliance's streamlined processes and e/uniFB03ciency enhancements have significantly improved the quality of life for many. Reliance innovations have led to higher productivity, better results and increased motivation among people to do better.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable Supply Chain Management\n\nReliance Retail relies heavily on third-party manufacturing partners. Any failure on the part of suppliers to comply with dynamically changing regulations and issues of human rights violations can disrupt the Company's operations and create negative sentiments amongst stakeholders, including customers and impact business. The Company has a structured approach to enhancing supplier performance, deepening sustainability practices, and a well-defined Code of Conduct that mandates respect for human rights across the value chain.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 222\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic Performance\n\nExtreme climatic situations can derail Reliance's business operations across O2C, E&P, Retail and Telecom and impact the Company's economic performance. Reliance is mindful of this and has set a goal to become a Net Carbon Zero company and created new growth engines, like the New Energy business. Future-proofing the Company against the disruptions of climate change is critical to protect its ability to grow revenue and profits, manage expenses and allocate resources, and generate adequate cash flows.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 42\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory Issues and Compliance\n\nReliance gains a competitive advantage by staying compliant as it demonstrates a commitment to transparency and accountability that is valued by customers, investors, and other stakeholders. In addition, compliance also promotes workforce engagement and retention, as employees feel proud to work for a company that upholds high ethical standards.\n\n## \u2192 PAGE 228\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk Management\n\nFor Reliance, identifying and addressing probable risks proactively is critical to improving the likelihood of achieving business objectives successfully.\n\n\u2192 PAGE 130, 158\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrong supply chain standards, monitoring mechanisms and ongoing engagement models with suppliers to address labour concerns are critical for Reliance to protect shareholder value over the long term. Sustainable supply chains are essential to further the Company's progress on its Net Carbon Zero goal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance is working on its Net Zero strategies led by investments to set up the world's largest integrated manufacturing ecosystem for green energy. By prioritising economic performance, Reliance can increase its profitability and competitiveness and accelerate its progress on the Net Carbon Zero journey, benefiting its stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance places a high priority on regulatory compliance, especially in an evolving regulatory environment. The Reliance Compliance Management System is a comprehensive, digitally enabled framework regularly updated and integrated with business processes, risks, and controls. The Group Compliance Committee monitors regulatory changes and provides timely updates to Directors on key developments and judicial rulings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReliance places utmost importance on employees and ensures a reduction in the likelihood and severity of potential project risks through early identification and a ready action plan to handle untoward incidents.",

The policy terms are implemented through a systematic Operating Management System (OMS) that promotes execution excellence and compliance to manage Health, Safety, Security and Environment (HSSE) risks in daily operations.

This function aligns OMS requirements with global and national standards such as OSHA, ACGIH, API, PESO, PNGRB, OISD and NFPA. The Company has adopted a three lines of defense approach to gain an impartial\n\nperspective on OMS implementation for operations and maintenance procedures. The OMS principles are integrated within the operational framework, ensuring the safe, compliant and dependable functioning of the business. The system is continually enhanced to draw on learnings from incidents to improve operational e/uniFB03ciency, safety and reliability further.\n\nThe Company conducts regular training sessions for employees and workers to improve their awareness and understanding of workplace hazards and risks. The Company maintains open communication channels with its employees and workers to understand their concerns and feedback related to HSE and address them promptly.\n\nReliance collaborates with other industry players to further the mission of health and safety for all and sponsored the \"6 th Global Summit on Process Safety\" organised by the Centre for Chemical Process Safety.\n\nThe Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management system at Reliance encompasses the Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) process, workers' training and incident identification frameworks.

Through regular message broadcasting, the Company keeps employees informed about safety policies, procedures, and best practices, empowering them to take ownership of safety.\n\nThrough consistent engagement with the asset-facing personnel, the Company has demonstrated unwavering commitment to maintaining a secure work environment.

The learning module sensitises employees about the concept of bribery, how it happens, and its various types, causes, and e/uniFB00ects. The module helps recognise red flags indicating bribery, advises about overcoming bribery, and explains the link between ABMS and Reliance's Code of Conduct. The module also emphasises the importance of ABMS violation reporting. It highlights Reliance's expectations from employees and business associates in the context of its Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) policy.\n\nTo benchmark itself against the best in class, Reliance has adopted the ISO 37001:2016 standards for its ABMS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Grievance Redressal Mechanisms\n\nEmployees and other stakeholders are required to report actual or suspected violations of applicable laws and regulations and the Code of Conduct.\n\nReliance has established a robust mechanism through a Vigil Mechanism and Whistle-blower Policy for reporting and handling of such violations, termed as 'Reportable Matters'. Under this policy, the employees are encouraged to report any such violations without fear of retaliation. For easy access, the Vigil Mechanism and Whistle-blower Policy is hosted on the website of the Company. The whistle-blower can make a protected disclosure either to the Ethics and Compliance Task Force or directly to the Audit Committee via e-mail, telephone or letter without fear of any reprisal.\n\n## WAY FORWARD\n\nReliance is leading the movement to build the next generation of leaders who will significantly contribute to the advancement of India and the world. The Company aspires to advance its internal talent management system to accelerate the development of employees while ensuring their overall emotional and physical wellbeing. Reliance will embed the principles of diversity and inclusion deeper into its core strategic intent and across its operations and value chain. Implementing globally benchmarked Health, Safety and Environment practices will continue to be a critical focus for the Company.\n\nThe Company has outlined ten tenets to develop institutional leadership capacity and intends to relentlessly nurture human capital by significantly focusing on identified parameters.

Reliance supports and encourages its suppliers to indigenise, expand their capabilities, and grow their economic returns. The Company has established long-term relationships with leading Indian engineering companies, raw material suppliers, and industrial goods manufacturers and procured 75% of goods and services (non-crude/nonfeedstock) from indigenous suppliers in FY 2022-23.\n\nReliance has launched the 'Supplier Relation Management (SRM)' programme to engage in constructive dialogue with critical O&M (Operations and Maintenance) contractors who provide services across the manufacturing sites. The SRM programme aims to build mutually beneficial relationships with the Company's strategic service providers to drive higher and more satisfying service levels and promote quality, productivity, innovation, and ethical value-based association. Thirty contractors have been selected to participate in the first phase of this programme.\n\nReliance delivers superior products and services to its customers by working with its contractors to ensure that their employees are competent and that work is carried out in a safe environment in compliance with statutory requirements. Some of the initiatives on this front include:\n\n- \u00b7 Standardisation of PPEs for contract workmen\n- \u00b7 Fair & transparent practices of statutory compliance\n- \u00b7 Contractor performance evaluation, including safety and environment performance\n\n- \u00b7 Trade & safety test for all contract workmen\n- \u00b7 Focus on safety practices and records during new contractor registration\n- \u00b7 Pre-medical check-ups for all contract workmen\n- \u00b7 Weekly visit of safety ambassadors to plants for improvement of the safety of contract workmen\n- \u00b7 Training for field personnel for safe handling of hazardous chemicals by vendors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable Supply Chain Management\n\nReliance has implemented several initiatives in its supply chain to promote sustainable sourcing, reduce its environmental impact, and promote supplier engagement. The Company's sustainable sourcing ethos focuses on following eight parameters:\n\nGreen Packaging: Reliance focuses on using recycled plastic/PET flakes, returnable pallets/tubes management, optimisation of bag specifications, and palletisation to reduce material usage and ensure safe handling and faster turnaround.\n\nEnvironment Protection: Reliance aims to reduce wood consumption by replacing pine-wood platters with plastic pallets, bring down paper consumption through the use of 5-ply recycle cartons, and prefer energye/uniFB03cient products. The Company makes procurement decisions based on energy e/uniFB03ciency and procures energy-e/uniFB03cient LED/solar lights. Reliance also focuses on catalyst regeneration/rare metals reuse.\n\nSupplier Collaboration: Reliance collaborates with its contractors and suppliers to build contractor capacity, invest in R&D, ensure business continuity through suppliers' new generation leaders, and establish long-term agreements. Major O&M contractors have established new skill development centres for Hazira,\n\nDahej and Vadodara, and have operationalised their skill centre in Jamnagar to cater to the Company's skilled resource requirements. Mechanical maintenance contractors have arranged train-the-trainer sessions through OEMs. In addition, contractors are investing in research and development (R&D) to continuously develop new tools, clamp design, and standard operating procedures to increase productivity and reduce lead times.\n\nReliance is also building business continuity with its suppliers' nextgeneration leaders who are keen on digital initiatives and support the Company's current roll-out plans. Long-term agreements have been established with packaging suppliers to reduce system costs, including joint programmes with vendors to develop new products that o/uniFB00er alternate grades, lower dosage, and better product quality. Reliance is capturing the risk of high spend critical O&M service providers across business continuity, compliance, and financial risk. These collaborative e/uniFB00orts aim to build trust and establish long-term partnerships with contractors and suppliers to achieve the Company's business objectives.\n\n## Make in India and Development of India's Engineering Talent:\n\nReliance has taken several initiatives to promote local sourcing and indigenisation of its supply chain. These include the replacement of imported Spin Finish oil with in-house recipes and indigenous manufacture, and development of alternate lubricity additive from a local source for the refinery. Reliance has also onboarded local suppliers to de-risk single source overseas suppliers and developed local integrators to supply low spend spares/consumables currently supplied by multiple tail spend vendors.\n\nLaunch of Digital Platform Applications for Procurement and Contracts: Reliance has launched a digital Procurement and Contracts (P&C) platform that uses Industry 4.0\n\ntechnologies to streamline end-to-end procurement processes. The platform includes several applications such as SourcingFirst, SupplierFirst, WellSpent and BuyerFirst, which ensure compliance with the Company's sourcing policy, provide real-time visibility of the sourcing cycle, and minimise risk.\n\nThe P&C platform has developed multiple digital tools that enhance e/uniFB03ciency and address digital challenges faced by both buyers and suppliers. One such tool is the Automated Measurement Sheet (Green Channel), which considerably reduces invoicing lead time. This enables suppliers/contractors to receive quicker payment and better payment visibility. It also helps Reliance and its suppliers/ contractors to reduce paper usage and manual labor.\n\nContract Worker Care: Reliance ensures 100% compliance with laws and regulations related to contract worker wages payment verification, contractor worker safety focus, and contract worker PPE norms by work type.\n\nCommunity Support: Reliance encourages the use of \"near plant\" community in its contracts.\n\n## Regeneration and Safe Disposal:\n\nThe Company promotes the recycling of scrap thermal insulation, rejuvenation of hydro treating catalysts for refinery, sale of e-waste, used oil, used batteries, used catalyst, and plastic waste to vendors authorised by SPCB/CPCB, and recovery and recycling of all recyclable waste.\n\n## Robust Supplier Evaluation Criteria\n\nThe company follows a rigorous screening process for supplier registration and assessment during pre- and post-award stages. The Supplier Code of Conduct, is the basis of the company's relationship with its suppliers. Reliance strengthens its commitment to the Supplier\n\nCode of Conduct by seeking explicit acceptance from its suppliers. The company also facilitates measures to comply with Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Bribery, and Prevention of Corruption Act and its own Supplier Code of Conduct. The Ethics Committee and compliance functions undertake regulatory compliance and counterparty checks, real-time screening, and investigations to curb unlawful behaviour by suppliers.\n\nReliance has also subscribed to EcoVadis Sustainable Procurement solution to assess value chain partners in the O2C business on 21 parameters covering four major criteria: Environment, Labour & Human Rights, Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. As on March 31, 2023, the Company has engaged with over 90% of suppliers on the aforementioned assessment, of which 11% have completed the assessment.\n\n## WAY FORWARD\n\nAs a leading multinational conglomerate, Reliance prioritises strengthening social and relationship capital to drive long-term growth and success. The Company continuously emphasises the significance of building and maintaining strong relationships with key stakeholders such as customers, communities, and supply chain partners.\n\nReliance has adopted a customer-centric approach to understand the needs and preferences of its customers and provide tailored experiences and services that best meet their evolving needs. Combined with a world-class, di/uniFB00erentiated experience, Reliance will further enhance long-term shareholder value and expand outreach to an expanded customer base.\n\nThe Company will continue to prioritise the development of a robust and sustainable supply chain, working closely with suppliers to manage disruptions, improve e/uniFB03.alt1ciency, and drive innovation. Reliance is developing and strengthening\n\nits value chain relationships to better leverage the expertise and resources of its partners to accelerate growth and innovation. The Company also takes conscious measures to enhance the capabilities of its partners and suppliers to broaden growth opportunities for them. Reliance stays focused on encouraging its suppliers and partners to embrace sustainable sourcing practices to minimise the environmental impact of the Company's operations and that of its value chain.\n\nReliance's unstinting support for community developmental imperatives will aim to empower and enrich many more community members so they can become equal partners and contributors to the nation's success and secure a sustainable future for themselves and India.\n\nStrengthening its social and relationship capital through trust-led and transparent stakeholder engagement will continue to be critical to help Reliance achieve long-term sustainable success.",

The objective is to meet stakeholders' aspirations and societal expectations. Good governance practices stem from the dynamic culture and positive mindset of the organisation. We are committed to meet the aspirations of all our stakeholders. This is demonstrated in shareholder returns, high credit ratings, awards and recognitions, governance processes and an entrepreneurial performance focussed work environment. Additionally,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour customers have benefited from high quality products delivered at extremely competitive prices.\n\nThe essence of Corporate Governance lies in promoting and maintaining integrity, transparency and accountability in the management's higher echelons. The demands of Corporate Governance require professionals to raise their competence and capability levels to meet the expectations in managing the enterprise and its resources e/uniFB00ectively with the highest standards of ethics. It has thus become crucial to foster and sustain a culture that integrates all components of good governance by carefully balancing the inter relationship among the Board of Directors, Board Committees, Finance, Compliance & Assurance teams, Auditors and the Senior Management. Our employee satisfaction is reflected in the stability of senior management, ability to attract talent across various levels and substantially higher productivity. Above all, we feel honoured to be integral to India's social development. Details of several such initiatives are available in the Report on Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nAt RIL, Corporate Governance is all about maintaining a valuable relationship and trust with all the stakeholders. We consider stakeholders as partners in our success and remain committed to maximising stakeholders' value, be it Customers, Local Communities, Employees, Suppliers & Distributors, Trade Unions, NGOs, Investors & Shareholders and Government & Regulatory Authorities. This approach to value creation emanates from RIL's belief that sound governance system, based on relationship and trust, is integral to creating enduring value for all. We have a defined policy framework for ethical conduct of businesses. We believe that any business conduct can be ethical only when it rests on the six core values viz. Customer Value, Ownership\n\nMindset, Respect, Integrity, One Team and Excellence.\n\nAt RIL, we believe that as we move closer towards our aspirations of being a global corporation, our Corporate Governance standards must be globally benchmarked. Therefore, we have institutionalised the right building blocks for future growth. The building blocks will ensure that we achieve our ambition in a prudent and sustainable manner. RIL not only adheres to the prescribed Corporate Governance practices as per the Listing Regulations, but is also committed to sound Corporate Governance principles and practices. It constantly strives to adopt emerging best practices being followed worldwide. It is our endeavour to achieve higher standards and provide oversight and guidance to the management in strategy implementation, risk management and fulfilment of stated goals and objectives.\n\nOver the years, we have strengthened governance practices. These practices define the way how business is conducted and value is generated. Stakeholders' interests are taken into account before making any business decision. RIL has the distinction of consistently rewarding its shareholders for over four eventful decades from Initial Public O/uniFB00er (IPO). Since then, RIL has moved from one big idea to another and these milestones continue to fuel its relentless pursuit of ever-higher goals.\n\nOn Standalone basis, we have grown by a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of Revenues 22.2%, Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) before exceptional items 22.9% and Net Profit before exceptional items 23.8%. The financial markets have endorsed our sterling performance and the market capitalisation has increased by CAGR of 30.5% during the same period. In terms of distributing wealth to our shareholders, apart from having a\n\ntrack record of uninterrupted dividend payout, we have also delivered consistent unmatched shareholder returns since listing. The result of our initiative is our ever widening reach and recall. Our shareholder base has grown from 52,000 after the IPO to a consolidated present base of around 36 lakh.\n\nFor decades, RIL is growing in step with India's industrial and economic development. The Company has helped transform the Indian economy with large projects and world-class execution. The quest to help elevate India's quality of life continues and is unabated. It emanates from a fundamental article of faith: 'What is good for India is good for Reliance'.\n\nWe believe, Corporate Governance is not just a destination, but a journey to constantly improve sustainable value creation. It is an upward-moving target that we collectively strive towards achieving. Our multiple initiatives towards maintaining the highest standards of governance are detailed in this Report.\n\n## Corporate Governance Structure, Policies and Practices\n\nThe Company has put in place an internal multi tier governance structure with defined roles and responsibilities of every constituent of the system. The Company's shareholders appoint the Board of Directors, which in turn govern the Company. The Board has established various Committees to discharge its responsibilities in an e/uniFB00ective manner. The Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) provides overall direction and guidance to the Board. In the operations and functioning of the Company, the CMD is assisted by Executive Directors and a core group of senior level executives.",

On an appeal by the Company, the Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal set aside SEBI's order and remanded the matter for fresh consideration by SEBI. SEBI issued a fresh show cause notice dated April 5, 2016 in the matter alleging incorrect disclosure of the diluted Earnings per Share. The Company filed a reply to the show cause notice and attended the personal hearing on July 26, 2016. SEBI appointed new Adjudicating O/uniFB03cer (AO). The last hearing before the AO was held on November 22, 2018. Further details sought by AO were provided in December 2018. After more than 2 years, the AO sent a letter dated March 19, 2021 granting an opportunity to the Company to make additional submissions and personal hearing in the matter.

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company\n\nin accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating e/uniFB00ectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the Standalone Financial Statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the Standalone Financial Statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Standalone Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted\n\nin accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/uniFB03cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements in place and the operating e/uniFB00ectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Standalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Standalone Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Standalone Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Standalone Financial Statements may be influenced.\n\nWe consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the e/uniFB00ect of any identified misstatements in the Standalone Financial Statements.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matter\n\nThe Standalone Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 st March, 2022, prepared in accordance with Ind AS have been audited by the predecessor auditors. The report of the predecessor auditors dated 6 th May, 2022, expressed an unmodified opinion.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our audit, we report that:\n- a) We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit.\n- b) In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books.\n- c) The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Cash Flow and Statement of Changes in Equity dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the books of account.",

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating e/uniFB00ectively for ensuring the orderly and e/uniFB03cient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under -section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\n\nabout whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/uniFB00ectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements and their operating e/uniFB00ectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/uniFB00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/uniFB03cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Standalone Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/uniFB00ect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With reference to Standalone Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Standalone Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## For Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP\n\nChartered Accountants\n\nFirm's Registration No. 117366W/W-100018\n\n## Abhijit A.

Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use.\n\nInterest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (h)  Inventories\n\nItems of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except in case of by-products which are valued at net realisable value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their respective present location and condition.\n\nCost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing\n\nmaterials, trading and other products are determined on weighted average basis.\n\n## Impairment of Non-Financial Assets - Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets\n\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets or group of Assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets.\n\nThe impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is reversed if there has been a change in the estimate of recoverable amount.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the e/uniFB00ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Provision for Decommissioning Liability\n\nThe Company records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (k)  Contingent Liabilities\n\nDisclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\n## (l) Employee Benefits Expense\n\nShort-Term Employee Benefits\n\nThe undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.\n\n## Post-Employment Benefits\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Company recognises contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to a reduction in future payment or a cash refund.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe Company pays gratuity to the employees who have completed five years of service with the Company at the time of resignation/ superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity fund has been approved by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and\n\nspread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\nEmployee Separation Costs: The Company recognises the employee separation cost when the scheme is announced, and the Company is demonstrably committed to it.\n\n## (m)  Tax Expenses\n\nThe tax expenses for the period comprises of current tax and deferred income tax. Tax is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## i. Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the Income Tax authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance sheet date.\n\n## ii. Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary di/uniFB00erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary di/uniFB00erences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of Deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## (n)  Share Based Payments\n\nEquity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-",

        "page_content": "to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023\n\nsettled share based payments transactions are set out in Note 29.2.\n\nThe fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments Reserve.\n\nThe dilutive e/uniFB00ect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\nIn case of Group equity-settled share-based payment transactions, where the Company grants stock options to the employees of its subsidiaries, the transactions are accounted by increasing the cost of investment in subsidiary with a corresponding credit in the equity.\n\n## (o)   Foreign Currencies Transactions and Translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency closing rates of exchange at the reporting date. Exchange di/uniFB00erences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange di/uniFB00erences which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets which are capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016 which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value\n\nof the item (i.e. translation di/uniFB00erences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\n\nIn case of an asset, expense or income where a non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## (p)  Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company is generally the principal as it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nGenerally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods is made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Company has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped.\n\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised over time by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations at the reporting period.\n\nRevenue is measured at the amount of consideration which the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring distinct goods or services to a customer as specified in the contract, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example taxes and duties collected on behalf of the government). Consideration is generally due upon satisfaction of performance obligations and a receivable is recognised when it becomes unconditional. Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of goods or services as the case may be. The Company provides volume rebates to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified and also accrues discounts to certain customers based on customary business practices which is derived on the basis of crude price volatility and various market demand - supply situations. Consideration are determined based on its most likely amount. Generally, sales of petroleum products contain provisional pricing features\n\nwhere revenue is initially recognised based on provisional price.\n\nDi/uniFB00erence between final settlement price and provisional price is recognised subsequently. The Company does not adjust short-term advances received from the customer for the e/uniFB00ects of significant financing component if it is expected at the contract inception that the promised good or service will be transferred to the customer within a period of one year.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Company's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or is due from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Company transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier).\n\nContract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Company performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest Income from a Financial Assets is recognised using e/uniFB00ective interest rate method.\n\n## Dividend Income\n\nDividend Income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the amount has been established.\n\n## (q)  Financial Instruments\n\n- i. Financial Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll Financial Assets are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of Financial Assets, which are not at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchase and sale of Financial Assets are recognised using trade date accounting. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\n## a) Financial Assets measured at Amortised Cost (AC)\n\nA Financial Asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)\n\nA Financial Asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling Financial Assets and the contractual terms of the Financial Asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represents solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\n\nA Financial Asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL. Financial assets are reclassified subsequent to their recognition, if the Company changes its business model for managing those financial assets. Changes in business model are made and applied prospectively from the reclassification date following the changes in business model in accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 Financial Instruments.\n\n## C. Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nThe Company has accounted for its investments in Subsidiaries, associates and joint venture at cost less impairment loss (if any). The investments in preference shares with the right of surplus assets which are in nature of equity in accordance with Ind AS 32 are treated as separate category of investment and measured at FVTOCI.",

        "page_content": "to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023\n\n## D. Other Equity Investments\n\nAll other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Company has elected to present the value changes in 'Other Comprehensive Income'. However, dividend on such equity investments are recognised in Statement of Profit and loss when the Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## E. Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of Financial Assets other than those measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL).\n\nExpected Credit Losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or\n- \u00b7 Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).\n\nFor Trade Receivables the Company applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\nThe Company uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nFor other assets, the Company uses 12 month ECL to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime ECL is used.\n\n## ii. Financial Liabilities\n\n## A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll Financial Liabilities are recognised at fair value and in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\nFinancial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the e/uniFB00ective interest method. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n\n## iii. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Company uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards & options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nDerivatives are carried as Financial Assets when the fair value is positive and as Financial Liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the e/uniFB00ective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later to Statement of Profit and Loss when the hedged item a/uniFB00ects profit or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a Non-Financial Assets or Non-Financial liability.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## A. Cash Flow Hedge\n\nThe Company designates derivative contracts or non-derivative Financial Assets/ Liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions.\n\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the e/uniFB00ective\n\nportion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ine/uniFB00ective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was e/uniFB00ective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the underlying transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## B. Fair Value Hedge\n\nThe Company designates derivative contracts or non-derivative Financial Assets/Liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the e/uniFB00ective interest method is used is amortised to Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.\n\n## iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company derecognises a Financial Asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the Financial Asset expire or it transfers the Financial Asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109. A Financial liability (or a part of a Financial liability) is derecognised from the Company's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## v. O/uniFB00setting\n\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities are o/uniFB00set and the net amount is presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company has a legally enforceable right to set o/uniFB00 the amount and it intends, either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (r) Non-current Assets Held for Sale\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable.\n\nA sale is considered as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the date of classification.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised.\n\nAssets and liabilities classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal and are presented separately in the Balance Sheet.\n\n## (s) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\nThe Company has adopted Successful E/uniFB00orts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. The policy of recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed o/uniFB00. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and evaluation other than those which are expensed o/uniFB00 are accounted for as Intangible Assets Under Development. All development costs incurred in respect of proved reserves are also capitalised under Intangible Assets Under Development. Once a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets Under Development are classified as Intangible Assets corresponding to proved developed oil and gas reserves. The exploration and evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss.",

        "page_content": "to the Standalone Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023\n\nThe Company uses technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually.\n\nOil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of joint operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Company's Financial Statements, according to the participating interest of the Company.\n\n## (t) Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at a later date.\n\n## C.   Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources Of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Company's Financial Statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that a/uniFB00ect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities a/uniFB00ected in next financial years.\n\n## (A)   Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe determination of the Company's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the determination of the Company's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Company bases it's proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Company's oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively\n\nby amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the Financial Statements.\n\nDetails on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 36.2.\n\n## (B)  Decommissioning Liabilities\n\nThe liability for decommissioning costs is recognised when the Company has an obligation to perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions. These include; the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\n\n## (C)   Property Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets\n\nEstimates are involved in determining the cost attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Property, Plant and Equipment/Intangible Assets are depreciated/amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking into account estimated residual value. Management reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation/ amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful life and residual values are based on the Company's historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological and future risks. The depreciation/amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes from previous estimates.\n\n## (D)  Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nJudgments are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required. Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.\n\n## (E) Provisions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe timing of recognition and quantification of the liability (including litigations) requires the application of judgement to existing facts and circumstances, which can be subject to change. The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed\n\nregularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.\n\n## (F)   Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates. The Company uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Company's past history, existing market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn case of non-financial assets, assessment of impairment indicators involves consideration of future risks. Further, the company estimates asset's recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset's or Cash Generating Units (CGU's) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\n## (G)   Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary di/uniFB00erences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be\n\nrecognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n## (H) Fair Value Measurement\n\nFor estimates relating to fair value of financial instruments refer note 39 of financial statements.\n\n## D.   Standards Issued but not E/uniFB00ective\n\nOn March 23, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate A/uniFB00airs (MCA) has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023. This notification has resulted into amendments in the following existing accounting standards which are applicable to company from April 1, 2023.\n\n- i.

The sensitivity analysis below, have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the assumptions occurring at end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant. The result of Sensitivity analysis is given below:\n\n|                                                                       | As at 31st March, 2023   | As at 31st March, 2023   | As at 31st March, 2022   | As at 31st March, 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Decrease                 | Increase                 | Decrease                 | Increase                 |\n| Change in rate of discounting (delta e/uniFB00ect of +/- 0.5%)        | 21                       | 22                       | 24                       | 26                       |\n| Change in rate of salary increase (delta e/uniFB00ect of -/+ 0.5%)    | 22                       | 23                       | 25                       | 26                       |\n| Change in rate of employee turnover (delta e/uniFB00ect of -/+  0.5%) | 2                        | 2                        | 2                        | 2                        |\n\nThese plans typically expose the Company to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and Salary Risk.\n\n| Investment Risk   | The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.                                                                                  |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest Risk     | A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially o/uniFB00set  by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.                                                                                                       |\n| Longevity Risk    | The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate  of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life  expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability. |\n| Salary Risk       | The present value of the defined plan liability is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan  participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the plan's liability.                                                                |\n\n## 29.2  Share Based Payments\n\n## a) Scheme details\n\nThe Company has Employees' Stock Option Scheme i.e. ESOS-2017 under which options have been granted at the exercise price of C 10 per share to be vested from time to time on the basis of performance and other eligibility criteria.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million ( C 1,353 crore) being the Company's share (total demand $ 247 million C 2,029 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023. The next date of hearing is awaited.\n\nIn supersession of the Ministry's Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10 th January, 2014, the GOI notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26 th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit di/uniFB00erential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 crore (net) as at 31 st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1 st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\n\n- 36.4 (a) GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4 th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US$ 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24 th July, 2018 upheld Contractor's claims. GOI filed an appeal on 15 th November, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9 th May, 2023, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award dated 24 th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI's appeal.\n- (b) Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) against GOI on 16 th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts ('PSCs') for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to di/uniFB00erence in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 16 th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 ('2018 FPA'). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI's challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants' challenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable award on 29 th January, 2021 ('EPOD Agreements Case Award'). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements Case Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9 th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of Claimants' request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nGOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The Claimants contend that GOI's Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government's Execution Petition before the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon'ble Court ruled that Government of India's execution petition seeking enforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal's Final Partial Award dated 12 th October, 2016 ('2016 FPA') relating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.\n\n- (c) NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company's fact witnesses in the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\n\nConsidering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure to the Company will have an e/uniFB00ect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/ litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\n\n## 36.5  Exploration for and Evaluation of Oil and Gas Resources\n\nThe following financial information represents the amounts included in Intangible Assets under Development relating to activity associated with the exploration for and evaluation of oil and gas resources.\n\n| Particulars                               | As at  31st March, 2023   | ( C  in crore) As at  31st March, 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Exploration & Evaluation (E&E) Cost       |                           |                                          |\n| Exploration Expenditure written o/uniFB00 | -                         | 102                                      |\n| Other Exploration Cost                    | 4                         | 79                                       |\n| Exploration Cost for the year             | 4                         | 181                                      |",

and\n\nLevel 3 : Inputs based on unobservable market data.\n\n## Valuation Methodology\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:\n\n- a) The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of Deposit and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.\n- b) The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n- c) The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.\n- d) The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.\n- e) Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers and price index developers.\n\n- f) The fair value for level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions and other data that are available.\n- g) The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.\n- h) All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.\n\n## B. Financial Risk Management\n\nThe company's activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.

The company has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs.\n\nThe Company's commodity risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Company enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\n\n## iii) Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the company. Credit risk arises from company's activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables from customers. The Company ensure that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Investment and other market exposures are managed against counterparty exposure limits. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify and respond to cases of credit deterioration.\n\nThe company has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. Credit risk is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Company Guarantees, advance payments and factoring & forfeiting without recourse to the company to avoid concentration of risk. The company restricts its fixed income investments to liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\n## iv) Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the Company's inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The company maintains su/uniFB03cient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The company accesses global and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure e/uniFB03cient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the company's cash flow position and ensures that the company is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\nThe company's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the di/uniFB00erent operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n\n|                           | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Particulars ^             | Below 3  Months                           | 3-6 Months                                | 6-12 Months                               | 1-3 Years                                 | 3-5 Years                                 | Above 5 Years                             | Total                                     |\n| Borrowings                |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| Non-Current * @           | 12,633                                    | 7,389                                     | 24,053                                    | 56,150                                    | 21,040                                    | 59,234                                    | 1,80,499                                  |\n| Current  $                | 33,985                                    | 2,387                                     | -

The Company has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge e/uniFB00ectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method and critical term matching method.\n\nThe hedge ine/uniFB00ectiveness can arise from:\n\n- - Di/uniFB00erences in the timing of the cash flows.\n- - Di/uniFB00erent indexes (and accordingly di/uniFB00erent curves).\n- - The counterparties' credit risk di/uniFB00erently impacting the fair value movements.\n\nThe table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:\n\n## Disclosure of e/uniFB00ects of hedge accounting\n\n- A.

Other information so far as it relates to the joint operations, subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, is traced from their financial statements / financial information audited by the other auditors.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Parent's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated changes in equity of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Group and its associates and its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating e/uniFB00ectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements by the Directors of the Parent, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the respective",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/uniFB03cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Parent has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating e/uniFB00ectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a\n\ngoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/uniFB03cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities or business activities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities or business activities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been audited by the other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial Statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors (i) in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the e/uniFB00ect of any identified misstatements in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance of the Parent and such other entities included in the Consolidated Financial Statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current year and are therefore the key\n\naudit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Matters\n\n- (a) The Consolidated Financial Statements include the financial statements / financial information of 181 subsidiaries, whose Standalone / Consolidated Financial Statements / financial information reflect total assets of C 8,02,378 crore as at 31 st March, 2023, total revenues of C 2,45,656 crore and net cash inflows amounting to C 767 crore for the year ended on that date.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating e/uniFB00ectively for ensuring the orderly and e/uniFB03cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the 'Guidance Note') issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements. Those Standards and the Guidance\n\nNote require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e/uniFB00ectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements and their operating e/uniFB00ectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/uniFB00ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the subsidiary companies, associate companies and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is su/uniFB03cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Parent, its subsidiary companies, its associate companies and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance\n\nwith authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/uniFB00ect on the financial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to Consolidated Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of the reports of the other auditors\n\n## For Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP\n\nChartered Accountants\n\nFirm's Registration No. 117366W/W-100018\n\n## Abhijit A.

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## B.1  Basis of Preparation and Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following assets and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:\n\n- i. Certain financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments),\n- ii. Defined Benefit Plan's - Plan Assets and\n- iii. Equity settled Share Based Payments\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (as amended from time to time) and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, (Ind AS compliant Schedule III), as applicable to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprises of Reliance Industries Limited and all its subsidiaries, being the entities that it controls. Control is assessed in accordance with the requirement of Ind AS 110 Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Indian Rupees ( C ) and all values are rounded to the nearest crore ( C 00,00,000), except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## B.2 Principles of Consolidation\n\n- (a) The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together like items of assets, liabilities, equity, incomes, expenses and cash flows, after fully eliminating intra-group balances and intragroup transactions.\n\n- (b) Profits or losses resulting from intra-group transactions that are recognised in assets, such as Inventory and Property, Plant and Equipment, are eliminated in full.\n- (c) In case of foreign subsidiaries, revenue items are consolidated at the average rate prevailing during the year. All assets and liabilities are converted at rates prevailing at the end of the year. Any exchange di/uniFB00erence arising on consolidation is recognised in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve (FCTR).\n- (d) The audited/unaudited financial statements of foreign subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates have been prepared in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principle of its Country of Incorporation or Ind AS.\n- (e) The di/uniFB00erences in accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries/joint ventures/ associates are not material and there are no material transactions from 1st January, 2023 to 31 st March, 2023 in respect of subsidiaries/joint ventures/associates having financial year ended 31st December, 2022.\n- (f) The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary is o/uniFB00set (eliminated) against the parent's portion of equity in each subsidiary.\n\n- (h) The di/uniFB00erence between the proceeds from disposal of investment in subsidiaries and the carrying amount of its assets less liabilities as on the date of disposal is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss being the profit or loss on disposal of investment in subsidiary.\n- (i) Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures has been accounted under the Equity Method as per Ind AS 28 - Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures. Investments in joint operations are accounted using the Proportionate Consolidation Method as per Ind AS 111 - Joint Arrangements.\n- (j) The Group accounts for its share of postacquisition changes in net assets of associates and joint ventures, after eliminating unrealised profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures.\n- (k) Non-Controlling Interest's share of profit/loss of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted against the income of the Group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n- (l) Non-Controlling Interest's share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## B.3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## (a) Current and Non-Current Classification\n\nThe Group presents assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet based on Current/NonCurrent classification.\n\nAn asset is treated as Current when it is -\n\n- -Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle;\n- -Held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- -Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- -Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classified as Non-Current.\n\nA liability is treated as Current when -\n\n- -It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle;\n- -It is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\n- -It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or\n- -There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nThe Group classifies all other liabilities as Non-Current.\n\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities are classified as Non-Current Assets and Liabilities.\n\n## (b)  Business Combination\n\nBusiness Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, except for common control transactions which are accounted using the pooling of interest method that is accounted at carrying values.\n\nThe cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date i.e. the date on which control is acquired. Contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at fair value and included as part of cost of acquisition. Transaction related costs are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred.\n\nFor each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nGoodwill arising on business combination is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. After initial recognition, Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses if any.\n\nCommon control business combination: Business combinations involving entities or businesses that are controlled by the group are accounted using the pooling of interest method.\n\n## (c) Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment are stated at cost, net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing cost and any cost directly attributable to bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the assets. In case of land the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably. Property, Plant and Equipment which are significant to the total cost of that item of Property, Plant and Equipment and having di/uniFB00erent useful life are accounted separately. Other Indirect Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed under Capital Work-in-Progress.\n\nDepreciation on Property, Plant and Equipment is provided using written down value method on depreciable amount except in case of certain assets of Oil to Chemicals and other segment which are depreciated using straight line method. Depreciation on wireless telecommunications equipment and components is determined based on the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits. Depreciation is provided based on useful life of the assets",

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of a Property, Plant and Equipment are measured as the di/uniFB00erence between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (d)  Leases\n\nThe Group, as a lessee, recognises a right-ofuse asset and a lease liability for its leasing arrangements, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset.\n\nThe contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, if it involves the use of an identified asset and the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset and has right to direct the use of the identified asset. The cost of the rightof-use asset shall comprise of the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date plus any initial direct costs incurred. The right-of-use assets is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation/amortisation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated/ amortised using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset.\n\nThe Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be\n\nreadily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate.\n\nFor short-term and low value leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group, as a lessor, classifies a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease. Leases are classified as finance lease whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (e) Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther Intangible Assets are stated at cost of acquisition net of recoverable taxes, trade discount and rebates less accumulated amortisation/depletion and impairment loss, if any. Such cost includes purchase price, borrowing costs, and any cost directly attributable for preparing the asset for its intended use, net charges on foreign exchange contracts and adjustments arising from exchange rate variations attributable to the Other Intangible Assets. In case of certain Other Intangible Assets, the Group has availed fair value as deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS.\n\nSubsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity and the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nOther Indirect Expenses incurred relating to project, net of income earned during the project development stage prior to its intended use, are considered as pre-operative expenses and disclosed under Intangible Assets Under Development.\n\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an Other Intangible Asset are measured as the di/uniFB00erence between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\nThe Group's Other Intangible Assets include assets with finite and indefinite useful life. Assets with finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful life and assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually at the cash generating unit level.\n\nA summary of the amortisation/depletion policies applied to the Group's Other Intangible Assets to the extent of depreciable amount is as follows.\n\n| Particulars         | Depreciation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Technical  Know-How | Over the useful life of the underlying  assets ranging from 5 years to 35 years                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Computer  Software  | Over a period of 5 to 10 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Development  Rights | W.r.t.

Development costs are capitalised as an intangible asset if it can be demonstrated that the project is expected to generate future economic benefits, it is probable that those future economic benefits will flow to the entity and the costs of the asset can be measured reliably, else it is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (g)  Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents comprise of cash on hand, cash at bank, short-term deposits and short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (h)  Finance Costs\n\nBorrowing costs include exchange di/uniFB00erences arising from foreign currency borrowings to the\n\nextent they are regarded as an adjustment to the interest cost. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of such assets. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. Interest income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the period for which they are incurred.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(i)\n\n## Inventories\n\nItems of inventories are measured at lower of cost and net realisable value after providing for obsolescence, if any, except in case of byproducts which are valued at net realisable value. Cost of inventories comprises of cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs including manufacturing overheads net of recoverable taxes incurred in bringing them to their respective present location and condition. Cost of finished goods, work-in-progress, raw materials, chemicals, stores and spares, packing materials, trading and other products are determined on weighted average basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (j) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that any Property, Plant and Equipment, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets or group of assets, called Cash Generating Units (CGU) may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss to the extent, asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is higher of an asset's fair value less cost of disposal and value in use. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and risk specific to the assets.

If the e/uniFB00ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.\n\n## Provision for Decommissioning Liability\n\nThe Group records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets. Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## (l) Contingent Liability\n\nDisclosure of contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of amount cannot be made.\n\n## (m)  Employee Benefits Expense\n\nShort-Term Employee Benefits\n\nThe undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised as an expense during the period when the employees render the services.\n\n## Post-Employment Benefits\n\n## Defined Contribution Plans\n\nThe Group recognises contribution payable to the provident fund scheme as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the balance sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or refund.\n\n## Defined Benefit Plans\n\nThe Group pays gratuity to the employees who have completed five years of service at the time of resignation/superannuation. The gratuity is paid @15 days basic salary for every completed year of service as per the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972. The gratuity liability amount is contributed to the approved gratuity fund formed exclusively for gratuity payment to the employees. The gratuity fund has been approved by respective Income Tax authorities. The liability in respect of gratuity and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the period in which they occur, in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## Employee Separation Costs\n\nThe Group recognises the employee separation cost when the scheme is announced and the Group is demonstrably committed to it.\n\n## (n)  Tax Expenses\n\nThe tax expenses for the period comprises of Current Tax and Deferred Income Tax. Tax is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in the Other Comprehensive Income. In which case, the tax is also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.\n\n## i. Current Tax\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation\n\nauthorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted at the Balance sheet date.\n\n## ii. Deferred Tax\n\nDeferred Tax is recognised on temporary di/uniFB00erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred Tax Assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary di/uniFB00erences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The carrying amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period.\n\n## (o)  Share Based Payments\n\nEquity-settled share based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at the grant date. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equitysettled share based payments transactions are set out in Note 28.2. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss such that the cumulative expenses reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the Share Based Payments Reserve. The dilutive e/uniFB00ect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\n\n## (p)   Foreign Currencies Transactions and Translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated\n\nat the functional currency's closing rates of exchange at the reporting date.\n\nExchange di/uniFB00erences arising on settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent of exchange di/uniFB00erences which are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on foreign currency borrowings that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets, are capitalised as cost of assets. Additionally, exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings taken prior to April 1, 2016, which are related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are adjusted in the carrying cost of such assets.\n\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are recorded using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. The gain or loss arising on translation of non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fair value of the item (i.e. translation di/uniFB00erences on items whose fair value gain or loss is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss are also recognised in Other Comprehensive Income or Statement of Profit and Loss, respectively).\n\nIn case of an asset, expense or income where a non-monetary advance is paid/received, the date of transaction is the date on which the advance was initially recognised. If there were multiple payments or receipts in advance, multiple dates of transactions are determined for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\n## (q)  Revenue Recognition\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Group is generally the principal as it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nGenerally, control is transferred upon shipment of goods to the customer or when the goods is made available to the customer, provided transfer of title to the customer occurs and the Group has not retained any significant risks of ownership or future obligations with respect to the goods shipped.",

Generally, the credit period varies between 0-60 days from the shipment or delivery of goods or services as the case may be.\n\nThe Group provides volume rebates to certain customers once the quantity of products purchased during the period exceeds a threshold specified and also accrues discounts to certain customers based on customary business practices which is derived on the basis of crude price volatility and various market demand supply situations. Consideration is determined based on its most likely amount.\n\nGenerally, sales of petroleum products contain provisional pricing features where revenue is initially recognised based on provisional price. Di/uniFB00erence between final settlement price and provisional price is recognised subsequently.\n\nThe Group does not adjust short-term advances received from the customer for the e/uniFB00ects of significant financing component if it is expected at the contract inception that the promised good or service will be transferred to the customer within a period of one year.\n\n## Contract Balances\n\n## Trade Receivables\n\nA receivable represents the Group's right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n## Contract Liabilities\n\nA contract liability is the obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration or is due from the customer. If a customer pays consideration before the Group transfers goods or services to the customer, a contract liability is recognised when the payment is made or the payment is due (whichever is earlier). Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the Group performs under the contract.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest Income from a financial asset is recognised using E/uniFB00ective Interest Rate Method.\n\n## Dividend Income\n\nDividend Income is recognised when the Group's right to receive the amount has been established.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (r) Financial Instruments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- i. Financial Assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A. Initial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets, which are not at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss, are adjusted to the fair value on initial recognition. Purchase and sale of financial assets are recognised using trade date accounting. However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\n## a) Financial assets measured at Amortised Cost (AC)\n\nA financial asset is measured at Amortised Cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specified dates that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## b) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)\n\nA financial asset is measured at FVTOCI if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## c) Financial Assets measured at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)\n\nA financial asset which is not classified in any of the above categories are measured at FVTPL.\n\nFinancial assets are reclassified subsequent to their recognition, if the Group changes\n\nits business model for managing those financial assets. Changes in business model are made and applied prospectively from the reclassification date following the changes in business model in accordance with principles laid down under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments.\n\n## C. Other Equity Investments\n\nAll other equity investments are measured at fair value, with value changes recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except for those equity investments for which the Group has elected to present the value changes in 'Other Comprehensive Income'.\n\nHowever, dividend on such equity investments is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the Company's right to receive payment is established.\n\n## D. Impairment of Financial Assets\n\nIn accordance with Ind AS 109, the Group uses 'Expected Credit Loss' (ECL) model, for evaluating impairment of financial assets other than those measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL). Expected Credit Losses are measured through a loss allowance at an amount equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 The 12-months expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from those default events on the financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date); or\n- \u00b7 Full lifetime expected credit losses (expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the life of the financial instrument).\n\nFor trade receivables, the Group applies 'simplified approach' which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables. The Group uses historical default rates to determine impairment loss on the portfolio of trade receivables. At every reporting date these historical default rates are reviewed and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.\n\nFor other assets, the Group uses 12 month Expected Credit Loss to provide for impairment loss where there is no significant increase in credit risk. If there is significant increase in credit risk full lifetime Expected Credit Loss is used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ii. Financial Liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA.\n\nInitial Recognition and Measurement\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised at fair value and in case of borrowings, net of directly attributable cost. Fees of recurring nature are directly recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost.\n\n## B. Subsequent Measurement\n\nFinancial Liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the e/uniFB00ective interest method. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the balance sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n\n## iii. Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, forwards and options and commodity contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates, exchange rates and commodity prices. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are also subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives are taken directly to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, except for the e/uniFB00ective portion of cash flow hedge which is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and later to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, when the hedged item a/uniFB00ects profit or loss or is treated as basis adjustment if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability.\n\nHedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA.\n\n## Cash Flow Hedge\n\nThe Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative financial assets/liabilities",

        "page_content": "to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023\n\nas hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of movement in interest rates and foreign exchange rates for foreign exchange exposure on highly probable future cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or forecast cash transactions. When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, the e/uniFB00ective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve being part of Other Comprehensive Income. Any ine/uniFB00ective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold/terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in cash flow hedging reserve till the period the hedge was e/uniFB00ective remains in cash flow hedging reserve until the underlying transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the underlying transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\n## B. Fair Value Hedge\n\nThe Group designates derivative contracts or non-derivative financial assets/liabilities as hedging instruments to mitigate the risk of change in fair value of hedged item due to movement in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices.\n\nChanges in the fair value of hedging instruments and hedged items that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the e/uniFB00ective interest method is used is amortised to Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the period of maturity.\n\n## iv. Derecognition of Financial Instruments\n\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it\n\ntransfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109 - Financial Instruments. A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognised from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expires.\n\n## v. O/uniFB00setting\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are o/uniFB00set and the net amount is presented in the Balance Sheet when, and only when, the Group has a legally enforceable right to set o/uniFB00 the amount and it intends, either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## (s) Non-Current Assets Held for Sale\n\nNon-Current Assets are classified as Held for Sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and sale is considered highly probable. A sale is considered as highly probable when decision has been made to sell, assets are available for immediate sale in its present condition, assets are being actively marketed and sale has been agreed or is expected to be concluded within 12 months of the date of classification. Non-current assets held for sale are neither depreciated nor amortised. Assets and liabilities classified as Held for Sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost of disposal and are presented separately in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## (t) Accounting for Oil and Gas Activity\n\nThe Group has adopted Successful E/uniFB00orts Method (SEM) of accounting for its Oil and Gas activities. The policy of recognition of exploration and evaluation expenditure is considered in line with the principle of SEM. Seismic costs, geological and geophysical studies, petroleum exploration license fees and general and administration costs directly attributable to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed o/uniFB00. The costs incurred on acquisition of interest in oil and gas blocks and on exploration and evaluation other than those which are expensed o/uniFB00 are accounted for as Intangible Assets under Development. All development costs incurred in respect of Proved Reserves are also capitalised under Intangible Assets under Development. Once a well is ready to commence commercial production, the costs accumulated in Intangible Assets under Development are classified as Other Intangible Assets corresponding to proved\n\ndeveloped oil and gas reserves. The exploration and evaluation expenditure which does not result in discovery of proved oil and gas reserves and all cost pertaining to production are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n\nThe Group uses technical estimation of reserves as per the Petroleum Resources Management System guidelines 2011 and standard geological and reservoir engineering methods. The reserve review and evaluation is carried out annually. Oil and Gas Joint Ventures are in the nature of Joint Operations. Accordingly, assets and liabilities as well as income and expenditure are accounted on the basis of available information on a lineby-line basis with similar items in the financial statements, according to the participating interest of the Group.\n\n## (u)  Earnings Per Share\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share is calculated by dividing the net profit after tax by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year adjusted for bonus element in equity share. Diluted Earnings Per Share adjusts the figures used in determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period unless issued at a later date.\n\n## C.   Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\n\nThe preparation of the Group's financial statements requires management to make judgement, estimates and assumptions that a/uniFB00ect the reported amount of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities a/uniFB00ected in future periods.\n\n## (A)   Estimation of Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe determination of the Group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves requires significant judgements and estimates to be applied and these are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity, drilling of new wells, and commodity prices all impact on the determination of the Group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. The Group bases it's proved reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves are used to calculate depletion charges for the Group's oil and gas properties. The impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortising the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production. Oil and natural gas reserves also have a direct impact on the assessment of the recoverability of asset carrying values reported in the financial statements. Details on proved reserves and production both on product and geographical basis are provided in Note 35.\n\n## (B)  Decommissioning Liabilities\n\nThe liability for decommissioning costs are recognised when the Group has an obligation to perform site restoration activity. The recognition and measurement of decommissioning provisions involves the use of estimates and assumptions. These include the timing of abandonment of well and related facilities which would depend upon the ultimate life of the field, expected utilisation of assets by other fields, the scope of abandonment activity and pre-tax rate applied for discounting.\n\n## (C)   Property Plant and Equipment/Other Intangible Assets\n\nEstimates are involved in determining the cost attributable to bringing the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management. Property, Plant and Equipment/Other Intangible Assets are depreciated/ amortised over their estimated useful life, after taking into account estimated residual value. Spectrum Cost is amortised over its balance validity period, based on the expected pattern of consumption of the expected future economic benefits.\n\nManagement reviews the estimated useful life and residual values of the assets annually in order to determine the amount of depreciation/amortisation to be recorded during any reporting period. The useful life and residual values are based on the Group's historical experience with similar assets and take into account anticipated technological and future risks. The depreciation/ amortisation for future periods is revised if there are significant changes from previous estimates.\n\n## (D) Recoverability of Trade Receivables\n\nJudgements are required in assessing the recoverability of overdue trade receivables and determining whether a provision against those receivables is required. Factors considered include the credit rating of the counterparty, the amount and timing of anticipated future payments and any possible actions that can be taken to mitigate the risk of non-payment.",

The carrying amounts of provisions and liabilities are reviewed regularly and revised to take account of changing facts and circumstances.\n\n## (F)   Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets with indefinite useful life\n\nManagement reviews the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life annually, to determine whether there has been any impairment by allocating the value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life to a Cash Generating Unit (CGU). The Group has identified CGUs' for this purpose, considering the nature of the businesses to which each of the CGU relates.\n\nValue in use i.e. the enterprise value of each CGU is aggregate of cash flow projections, for five years as approved by Senior Management and beyond five years extrapolated using a long-term growth rate which ranges from 2% to 5%. Cash flow projections are discounted by a pre-tax discount rate, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), which ranges from 8% to 12%.\n\nThe Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions on which recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the CGU.\n\n## (G)   Impairment of Financial and Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe impairment provisions for Financial Assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected cash loss rates. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the impairment calculation, based on Group's past history, existing market conditions as well as forwardlooking estimates at the end of each reporting period.\n\nIn case of non-financial assets, the Group estimates asset's recoverable amount, which is higher of an asset's or Cash Generating Units (CGU's) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated to the respective CGUs which are determined at the entity level. During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Group has determined that there is no impairment towards these assets.\n\n## (H)  Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary di/uniFB00erences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable profit. The Group uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits and business developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(I)\n\n## Fair Value Measurement\n\nFor estimates relating to fair value of financial instruments refer Note 38 of financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (J)  Revenue\n\nThe application of Accounting Standard on Revenue Recognition for digital segment involves complexity and use of key judgements with respect to multiple elements deliverables, timing of revenue recognition, accounting of discounts, incentives, etc. The Management has reviewed such accounting treatment and is satisfied about its appropriateness in terms of the relevant Ind AS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (K) Leases\n\nThe Group evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Group uses judgement in assessing whether a contract (or part of contract) include a lease, the lease term (including anticipated renewals), the applicable discount rate, variable lease payments whether are in-substance fixed. The judgement involves assessment of whether the asset included in the contract is a fully or partly identified asset based on the facts and circumstances, whether the contract include a lease and non-lease component and if so, separation thereof for the purpose of recognition and measurement, determination of lease term basis, inter alia the non-cancellable period of lease and whether the lessee intends to opt for continuing with the use of the asset upon the expiry thereof, and whether the lease payments are fixed are variable or a combination of both.\n\n## D.  Standards Issued but not E/uniFB00ective\n\nOn March 31, 2023, the Ministry of Corporate A/uniFB00airs (MCA) has notified Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023. This notification has resulted into amendments in the following existing accounting standards which are applicable to the Group from April 1, 2023.\n\n- i.

The above information is certified by the actuary.\n\nThe Expected Rate of Return on Plan Assets is determined considering several applicable factors, mainly the composition of Plan Assets held, assessed risks, historical results of return on Plan Assets and the Group's policy for Plan Assets Management.\n\n- VIII)   The expected contributions for Defined Benefit Plan for the next financial year will be in line with financial year 2022-23.\n- IX) These plan's typically expose the Group to actuarial risks such as: Investment Risk, Interest Risk, Longevity Risk and Salary Risk.\n\n| Investment Risk   | The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is  determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.                                                                                  |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Interest Risk     | A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partially o/uniFB00set  by an increase in the return on the plan's debt investments.                                                                                                       |\n| Longevity Risk    | The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate  of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment.

The Company continues to maintain that the Contractor is entitled to recover all of its costs under the terms of the PSC and there are no provisions that entitle the GOI to disallow the recovery of any Contract Cost as defined in the PSC. The Company referred the issue to arbitration with GOI for resolution of disputes. The demand from the GOI of $ 165 million ( C 1,353 crore) being the Company's share (total demand $ 247 million C 2,029 crore) towards additional Profit Petroleum has been considered as contingent liability in the financial statements for the year ended 31 st March, 2023. The next date of hearing is awaited.\n\nIn supersession of the Ministry's Gazette notification no. 22011/3/2012-ONG.D.V. dated 10 th January, 2014, the GOI notified the New Domestic Natural Gas Pricing Guidelines, 2014 on 26 th October 2014. The GOI had directed the Company to instruct customers to deposit di/uniFB00erential revenue on gas sales from D1D3 field on account of the prices determined under the guidelines converted to NCV basis and the prevailing price prior to 1 st November 2014 ($ 4.205 per MMBTU) to be credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL (India) Limited. The amount so deposited by customer to Gas Pool Account is C 295 crore (net) as at 31 st March, 2023. Revenue has been recognized at the GOI notified prices on GCV basis, in respect of gas quantities sold from D1D3 field from 1 st November 2014. This amount in the Gas Pool Account has also been challenged under cost recovery arbitration and is pending adjudication.\n\n- 35.4 (a) GOI sent a notice to the KG D6 Contractor on 4 th November, 2016 asking the Contractor to deposit approximately US$ 1.55 billion on account of alleged gas migration from ONGC's blocks. The Company, as Operator, for and on behalf of all constituents of the Contractor, initiated arbitration proceedings against the GOI contesting its unfair claim. The Arbitral Tribunal vide its Final Award dated 24 th July, 2018 upheld Contractor's claims. GOI filed an appeal on 15 th November, 2018 before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court, under section 34 of the Arbitration Act, against the Final Award of the Arbitral Tribunal. Vide Judgment dated 9 th May, 2023, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court upheld the Arbitration Award dated 24 th July, 2018 in the Gas Migration dispute and dismissed GOI's appeal.\n- (b) Arbitration was initiated by BG Exploration and Production India Limited and the Company (together the Claimants) against GOI on 16 th December, 2010 under Production Sharing Contracts ('PSCs') for Panna - Mukta and Tapti blocks due to di/uniFB00erence in interpretation of certain PSC provisions between Claimants and GOI. The Arbitral Tribunal by majority issued a final partial award ('2016 FPA'), and separately, two dissenting opinions in the matter on 12 th October, 2016. Claimants challenged certain parts of the 2016 FPA before the English Courts, which delivered its judgment on 16 th April, 2018 and remitted one of the challenged issues back to the Arbitral Tribunal for reconsideration. The Arbitral Tribunal decided in favour of the Claimants in large part vide its final partial award dated 1 st October, 2018 ('2018 FPA'). GOI and Claimants filed an appeal before the English Commercial Court against this 2018 FPA. The English Commercial Court rejected GOI's challenges to 2018 FPA and upheld Claimants' challenge in February 2020 and remitted the underlying issue in challenge back to the Arbitration Tribunal for determination. Tribunal gave favorable award on 29 th January, 2021 ('EPOD Agreements Case Award'). Government challenged the EPOD Agreements Case Award before the English High Court which was dismissed on 9 th June, 2022. Claimants have filed an application before the Arbitral Tribunal seeking increase in the PSC Cost Recovery Limits and the same is sub-judice. Arbitral Tribunal is yet to schedule the final re-computation of accounts and the quantification phase of the arbitration, which will take place post determination of Claimants' request for increase in cost recovery limit under the PSCs.\n\nGOI has also filed an execution petition before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court under sections 47 and 49 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 and Section 151 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 seeking enforcement and execution of the 2016 FPA, ignoring the judgments of English High Court and the subsequent Tribunal Awards. The Claimants contend that GOI's Execution Petition is not maintainable. The hearing in Government's Execution Petition before the Delhi High Court has concluded. Hon'ble Court ruled that Government of India's execution petition seeking enforcement and execution of the Arbitration Tribunal's Final Partial Award dated 12 th October, 2016 ('2016 FPA') relating to disputes under Panna-Mukta and Tapti Production Sharing Contracts is not maintainable.\n\n- (c) NTPC filed suit in 2006 for specific performance of contract for supply of natural gas of 132 trillion BTU annually for a period of 17 years. This suit is still pending adjudication in the Bombay High Court and the Company's fact witnesses in the suit are to be cross examined by NTPC.\n\nConsidering the complexity of above issues, the Company is of the view that any attempt for quantification of possible exposure to the Company will have an e/uniFB00ect of prejudicing Company's legal position in the ongoing arbitration/litigations. Moreover, the Company considers above demand/disputes as remote.\n\n|                                           |                                                                                                                             | As at   31st March, 2023                  |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| 36.

and\n\nLevel 3: Inputs based on unobservable market data.\n\n## Valuation Methodology\n\nAll financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value as described below:\n\n- a) The fair value of investment in quoted Equity Shares, Bonds, Government Securities, Treasury Bills, Certificate of Deposits and Mutual Funds is measured at quoted price or NAV.\n- b) The fair value of Interest Rate Swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.\n- c) The fair value of Forward Foreign Exchange contracts and Currency Swaps is determined using observable forward exchange rates and yield curves at the balance sheet date.\n- d) The fair value of over-the-counter Foreign Currency Option contracts is determined using the Black Scholes valuation model.\n- e) Commodity derivative contracts are valued using available information in markets and quotations from exchange, brokers and price index developers.\n- f) The fair value for Level 3 instruments is valued using inputs based on information about market participants assumptions and other data that are available.\n- g) The fair value of the remaining financial instruments is determined using discounted cash flow analysis.\n- h) All foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rate at reporting date.\n\n## B. Financial Risk Management\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Within the boundaries of approved Risk Management Policy framework, the Group uses derivative instruments to manage the volatility of financial markets and minimize the adverse impact on its financial performance.\n\n## i) Market Risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk and commodity risk.\n\n- a) Foreign Currency Risk\n\nForeign Currency Risk is the risk that the Fair Value or Future Cash Flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency rates. Exposures can arise on account of the various assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than Indian Rupee.\n\nThe following table shows foreign currency exposures in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen on financial instruments at the end of the reporting period. The exposure to all other foreign currencies are not material.\n\n|                             |          |          |          |                           |                           | ( C  in crore)            |\n|-----------------------------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                             |          |          |          | Foreign Currency Exposure | Foreign Currency Exposure | Foreign Currency Exposure |\n|                             | USD      | EUR      | JPY      | USD                       | EUR                       | JPY                       |\n| Borrowings                  | 1,35,702 | 12,029   | 11,693   | 1,17,302                  | 11,998                    | 12,054                    |\n| Trade and Other Payables    | 85,369   | 745      | 76       | 1,33,506                  | 1,261                     | 60                        |\n| Trade and Other Receivables | (12,251) | (280)    | (22)     | (14,914)                  | (319)                     | (22)                      |\n| Derivatives                 |          |          |          |                           |                           |                           |\n| -  Forwards and Futures     | (23,921) | (11,806) | (11,776) | (55,442)                  | (12,523)                  | (12,250)                  |\n| -  Options                  | (4,860)  | 301      | 96       | (2,877)                   | 126                       | (319)                     |\n| Exposure                    | 1,80,039 | 989      | 67       | 1,77,575                  | 543                       | (477)                     |\n\n- b) Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Group is also exposed to interest rate risk, changes in interest rates will a/uniFB00ect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally debt. The Group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities and it uses derivatives to hedge interest rate exposures.\n\nThe exposure of the Group's borrowings and derivatives to interest rate changes at the end of the reporting period are as follows:\n\n|                                                        | ( C  in crore)         | ( C  in crore)         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                        | Interest Rate Exposure | Interest Rate Exposure |\n| Particulars                                            | As at 31st March, 2023 | As at 31st March, 2022 |\n| Borrowings                                             |                        |                        |\n| Non-Current - Floating (Includes Current Maturities) * | 1,21,093               | 96,097                 |\n| Non-Current - Fixed (Includes Current Maturities) *    | 1,11,932               | 1,19,723               |\n| Current  #                                             | 82,577                 | 52,178                 |\n| Total                                                  | 3,15,602               | 2,67,998               |\n| Derivatives                                            |                        |                        |\n| Foreign Currency Interest Rate Swaps                   | 12,079                 | 7,712                  |\n| Rupees Interest Rate Swaps                             | 50,500                 | 54,845                 |\n\n- # Includes C 319 crore (Previous Year C 592 crore) as Commercial Paper Discount.",

The Group has a risk management framework aimed at prudently managing the risk arising from the volatility in commodity prices and freight costs.\n\nThe Group's commodity price risk is managed centrally through well-established trading operations and control processes. In accordance with the risk management policy, the Group enters into various transactions using derivatives and uses over-the-counter as well as Exchange Traded Futures, Options and Swap contracts to hedge its commodity and freight exposure.\n\n## iii) Credit Risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to perform or pay the amounts due causing financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises from Group's activities in investments, dealing in derivatives and receivables from customers and other financial instruments. The Group ensures that sales of products are made to customers with appropriate creditworthiness. Credit information is regularly shared between businesses and finance function, with a framework in place to quickly identify, respond and recognise cases of credit deterioration.\n\nThe Group has a prudent and conservative process for managing its credit risk arising in the course of its business activities. Credit risk across the Group, is actively managed through Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees, Parent Group Guarantees, advance payments, security deposits and factoring and forfaiting without recourse to Group. The Group restricts its fixed income investments in liquid securities carrying high credit rating.\n\n## iv) Liquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity risk arises from the Group's inability to meet its cash flow commitments on the due date. The Group maintains su/uniFB03cient stock of cash, marketable securities and committed credit facilities. The Group accesses global and local financial markets to meet its liquidity requirements. It uses a range of products and a mix of currencies to ensure e/uniFB03cient funding from across well-diversified markets and investor pools. Treasury monitors rolling forecasts of the Group's cash flow position and ensures that the Group is able to meet its financial obligation at all times including contingencies.\n\nThe Group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and liquidity requirements. Treasury pools the cash surpluses from across the di/uniFB00erent operating units and then arranges to either fund the net deficit or invest the net surplus in a range of short-dated, secure and liquid instruments including short-term bank deposits, money market funds, reverse repos and similar instruments. The portfolio of these investments is diversified to avoid concentration risk in any one instrument or counterparty.\n\n|                           | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   | Maturity Profile as at 31st March, 2023*   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Particulars*              | Below 3  Months                            | 3-6 Months                                 | 6-12 Months                                | 1-3 Years                                  | 3-5 Years                                  | Above 5 Years                              | Total                                      |\n| Borrowings                |                                            |                                            |                                            |                                            |                                            |                                            |                                            |\n| Non-Current  #@           | 13,449                                     | 8,594                                      | 27,254                                     | 78,290                                     | 42,750                                     | 62,688                                     | 2,33,025                                   |\n| Current  ^                | 77,761                                     | 3,500                                      | 1,316                                      | -

Hedge Accounting\n\nThe Group's business objective includes safe-guarding its earnings against adverse price movements of crude oil and other feedstock, refined products, precious metals, freight costs as well as foreign exchange and interest rates. The Group has adopted a structured risk management policy to hedge all these risks within an acceptable risk limit and an approved hedge accounting framework which allows for Fair Value and Cash Flow hedges. Hedging instruments include exchange traded futures and options, over-the-counter swaps, forwards and options as well as non-derivative instruments to achieve this objective.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships. To test the hedge e/uniFB00ectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and critical term matching method.\n\nThe hedge ine/uniFB00ectiveness can arise from:\n\n- - Di/uniFB00erences in the timing of the cash flows.\n- - Di/uniFB00erent indexes (and accordingly di/uniFB00erent curves).\n- - The counterparties' credit risk di/uniFB00erently impacting the fair value movements.\n\nThe table below shows the position of hedging instruments and hedged items as on the balance sheet date:",
