Since then, we have sold mature London o/ffices and made acquisitions that bring value, opportunity and long-term growth. And we've restructured our business to bring us closer to our customers and better able to take advantage of the changes on the horizon.\n\nHigh-quality o/ffices, in the right locations, continue to attract new businesses and talent; the future of major retail destinations is more positive than many people thought three years ago; and there remains a structural need to remodel city centres in a sustainable way. With /flexibility on the timing of any future capital commitments, we are ready to seize the opportunities this new market environment presents.\n\nBut our strategy is about more than buildings. It's built on a vision and commitment to shape successful and sustainable urban places where our customers can achieve their goals and our communities can realise their potential. With the quality of our portfolio, expertise of our people and strength of our customer relationships underpinning our business, this strategy is the right one and we are well positioned to continue to pursue it.\n\n## Contents\n\n## Strategic report\n\n002  Chairman's statement\n\n004  Chief Executive's statement\n\n008  Market context\n\n010  Our top ten assets\n\n011  Our stakeholders\n\n012  Our business model\n\n014  Our strategy\n\n016  Our KPIs\n\n017  Our strategic focus\n\n020  Operating and portfolio review\n\n028  Financial review\n\n034  Our people and culture\n\n040  Our approach to sustainability\n\n041  Build well - our commitment to the environment\n\n044  Live well - our commitment to our communities\n\n045  Act well - our commitment to being a responsible business\n\n047  Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\n\n(TCFD)\u00a0statement\n\n054  Managing risk\n\n056  Principal risks and uncertainties\n\n060  Going concern and viability\n\n062  Non-/financial information statement\n\n## Governance\n\n064  Introduction to the Corporate Governance Report\n\nfrom\u00a0the\u00a0Chairman\n\n065  Board of Directors\n\n069  Our governance structure\n\n072  Executive Leadership Team\n\n074  The Board in action\n\n076  The Board and our stakeholders\n\n080  The Board and our culture\n\n- 082  Introduction from the Chairman of the Nomination\u00a0Committee\n- 084  Report of the Nomination Committee\n- 085  Board induction\n- 086  Board evaluation\n- 088  Introduction from the Chairman of the Audit Committee\n- 090  Report of the Audit Committee\n- 096  Directors' Remuneration Report - Chairman's\u00a0Annual\u00a0Statement\n- 098  Remuneration at a glance\n- 100  Annual Report on Remuneration\n- 114  Directors' Remuneration Policy Summary\n- 117  Directors' Report\n\n## Financial statements\n\n- 120  Statement of Directors' Responsibilities\n- 121  Independent Auditor's Report\n- 129  Income statement\n- 129  Statement of comprehensive income\n- 130  Balance sheets\n- 131  Statements of changes in equity\n- 132  Statements of cash /flows\n- 133  Notes to the /financial statements\n\n## Additional information\n\n- 187  Business analysis - EPRA disclosures\n- 193  Business analysis - Group\n- 195  Sustainability performance\n- 199  Alternative performance measures\n\n200  Combined Portfolio analysis\n\n- 202  Reconciliation of segmental information\n\nnote to statutory reporting\n\n- 203  Ten year summary\n- 205  Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n- 210  Shareholder information\n- 213  Key contacts and advisers\n- 214  Glossary\n- 216  Cautionary statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the year we sold 21 Moor/fields, EC2, a complex development nearing completion that showcased Landsec's deep development expertise during the life of the project. We also sold One New Street Square, a recent development as part of a larger estate, let on a long lease to Deloitte. These two signi/ficant sales in the City reduce our overall exposure to this sub-market, and re-balance our portfolio towards London's West End and a portfolio increasingly focused on the best quality space. We have several developments ongoing in the rest of London and are seeing healthy demand for /flexible and environmentally friendly space amongst a wide range of customers.\n\nWe have also continued to strengthen our retail portfolio, signing exciting new lettings in our major retail destinations and acquiring the outstanding 50% of St David's centre in Cardi/ff that we did not already own. We continue to focus on investing as appropriate in our leading retail destinations, which post-pandemic have recovered well, proving that consumers value the experience of the best physical retail.\n\nWe have made progress on some exciting mixed-use opportunities as well, and our team has shown creativity and resilience unlocking some complex opportunities in London and Manchester. For example we obtained planning consent for our 1,800 homes masterplan at a site on the Finchley Road previously used for retail.\n\n## Managing returns\n\nWhile our strategy has remained clear and appropriate, the external macroeconomic environment over the last year has been di/fficult in the UK.

As a business we have re-focused on the levers within our control as we await more stable conditions.\n\nThe Board and management are always focused on disciplined capital allocation, and managing the balance sheet e/ffectively. Against a backdrop of rising interest rates and reducing values, our proactive approach to disposals means that our loan to value ratio has nonetheless fallen and stands at a sustainable 31.7%. We were pleased with the issue of our innovative Green bond in March as part of our ongoing bond issuance programme.\n\nA key part of our strategy is to provide shareholders with a predictable dividend each year, underpinned by high-quality earnings across our portfolio. The Board is focused on the resilience of underlying earnings, and factors in income considerations when approving sales or investments. The organisational review undertaken this year should generate e/fficiencies to o/ffset in/flation in the near term. We appreciate that for most of our shareholders our dividends are an important attraction, especially when capital returns are volatile.\n\n## Our organisation and culture\n\nSince Mark joined the business we have been focused on ensuring that Landsec is /fit for the future, especially in light of the upheavals in our market caused by the pandemic and macroeconomic change. Over the last year the structure of the organisation has been re-aligned to our future strategy, becoming /flatter and more streamlined. We have added external customer facing, data and technology skills to our senior team, and we now have a clear roadmap for digital transformation. While we have been sad to see some long-term colleagues leave as part of this project, we are very positive about the impact on our culture and e/fficiency that these changes are bringing. We continue to be committed to making Landsec's workforce truly re/flective of the diverse customers and communities that we serve see pages 35-38.\n\n## Our sustainability agenda\n\nWe continue to be proud of our sectorleading position on sustainability issues, but are not complacent with the level of change and investment that will be needed to make our existing assets more environmentally friendly.

The business has bene/fited considerably from her experience and leadership. Cressida's in/fluence and oversight have been signi/ficant in getting us to the strong strategic position we are in today, despite the signi/ficant challenges faced by this business during the pandemic and more recent macroeconomic challenges.\n\nI am excited and honoured to be taking over as Chair at a time of opportunity for signi/ficant development of the business in the coming years.\n\nSince joining the Board in March, I have spent time visiting Landsec locations and meeting members of the senior team and getting to understand more about the business. I am hugely impressed with the work Mark and his team are leading to drive the business forwards with strategic investments and disposals, stronger customer focus and operational performance and a more agile culture.\n\nI am looking forward to working with Mark and the Board on behalf of all of our stakeholders, to continue with this clear strategic momentum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ninnovation in our developments and have just completed The Forge in Southwark, our /first Net Zero carbon building powered entirely by renewable energy.

It has been a privilege to serve nine years on the Landsec Board, /five as your Chairman. We announced in January that Sir Ian Cheshire will succeed me. Ian has already joined the Board, and brings deep experience as a chair and leader to Landsec. I hope some of you will have the opportunity to meet him around the AGM.\n\nThere have been other Board changes of note during the year. Colette O'Shea stepped down as COO of the Company, following a restructuring of the executive team. Colette had been with Landsec for many years and made a signi/ficant contribution to the development and management of our portfolio, in London in particular. The Board is grateful for the commitment, insight and empathy she brought, and we wish her well for the future.\n\nWe welcomed Miles Roberts to the Board in September. Miles is a serving CEO, and also brings deep experience as a NED across several sectors. He has been a very positive addition to the Board and Committees.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nOverall the Board is con/fident that Landsec is well positioned relative to others in the sector, with a clear and appropriate strategy and strong management team to deliver it. I would like to thank our Landsec colleagues for all their e/fforts over the year.

Well positioned in a changing market.\n\nThe strategy we launched in late 2020 was based on two key principles of sustainable value creation: focusing our resources where we have a genuine competitive advantage, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Back then, interest rates and property yields in many sectors were at or near all-time low levels, making asset values in these sectors look expensive, yet since then external market conditions have changed materially, in particular over the last 12 months. Despite enduring customer demand driving rents and occupancy higher, increasing interest rates meant the value of our portfolio was down 7.7% for the year, as an average 50bps rise in valuation yields o/ffset an overall 3.6% ERV growth.\n\nWhereas many slowed or paused activity in response, we have remained active, pragmatic and future-focused in executing our strategy during the year. We sold \u00a31.4bn of London o/ffices where our ability to add further value was limited, bringing total o/ffice disposals since late 2020 to \u00a32.2bn, with an average yield of 4.4%, on average just 4% below book value. We selectively invested where we saw value, for example buying the debt secured on St David's, Cardi/ff at an implied property yield of 9.7%. We kept to programme on new developments by committing to early works during the political turmoil in the autumn whilst keeping /flexibility on c. \u00a3400m of future spend, which we now expect to commit to shortly. And we issued a \u00a3400m Green bond, to pro-actively extend our sectorleading debt maturities even further.\n\nOur areas of competitive advantage remain: i) our high-quality portfolio; ii) the strength of our customer relationships; and iii) our ability to unlock complex opportunities through our development and asset management expertise. Despite the change in market conditions, these strengths are clearly re/flected in our strong operational performance during the year and we expect these to persist going forward.",

        "page_content": "This is supported by the strength of our capital base. With a 31.7% LTV and net debt/EBITDA of 7.0x at the year-end our leverage is low; at 10.3 years our average debt maturity is long; and we have no need to re/finance any debt until 2026. We have also created more optionality in our attractive pipeline and as a result of our strategic choices and decisive action since late 2020, we are well placed to take advantage of the opportunities that will undoubtedly emerge in a new higher rate, higher yield environment.\n\n## Delivering continued growth in operational results\n\nAs people choose to spend time together in inspiring places, be it to work, shop or spend their leisure time, our customers increasingly focus on the best space in the best locations to attract the right talent and consumers. Building on the positive momentum our focus on growing customer relationships has started to drive over the past three years, we have delivered further growth in operational results.\n\nEPRA EPS for the year increased to 53.1 pence, or 50.1 pence on an underlying basis, excluding the bene/fit of a \u00a322m increase in surrender premiums received during the year. Underlying EPRA EPS was up 4.4% vs the prior year, towards the high end of our guidance of low to mid-single digit percentage growth. This was supported by growth in like-for-like net rental income of 6.0%, which more than o/ffset the impact from our \u00a31.4bn of disposals and our signi/ficant deleveraging. In line with growth in underlying earnings, our dividend for the year is up 4.3% to 38.6 pence, re/flecting a dividend cover of 1.3 times.\n\nThis is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, the strategy we set out in late 2020 was never built on a premise that low interest rates would persist forever. Neither are our actions now based on the hope that markets will just 'return to normal' and interest rates come back down sharply if we wait long enough. They might, but this seems unlikely to us and hope is not a strategy, so we have not and will not base our decision-making on this. Our disposal of \u00a31.4bn of mature o/ffices over the past year is testament to this.\n\nSecondly, and most importantly, this adjustment plays directly to the strengths we have been building since late 2020. At that time, it was di/fficult for us to /find value in a world where excess liquidity and zero interest rates meant there was invariably someone prepared to borrow more at arti/ficially low costs and pay more. However, since last summer, property values have been quick to adjust to the new reality of a higher cost of capital, similar to equities and bonds. The full e/ffect of increased borrowing costs will likely only work its way through the system over time, but this should lead to attractive opportunities for us.\n\nSince late 2020 our focus has been on i) focusing our new investment where we have a genuine competitive advantage that enables us to create long-term value; ii) the sale of \u00a32.2bn of London o/ffices where yields were low and we had little opportunity to add further value; and iii) maintaining capital discipline. As a result, we are well placed now.\n\nTo further support this, improve scalability and increase pace, we started a review of our operating model a year ago, with a view of creating a more agile, e/fficient culture, with less internal complexity and more external focus. We have built, or are on track to build, market-leading operating platforms in each of the three areas we operate in. We have started to see the bene/fits from this so despite high in/flation, we expect overhead costs for the current year to reduce slightly vs last year. Supplemented by ongoing investment in our systems, we have clear visibility on the further e/fficiencies this will drive over time.\n\nWhilst part of the property market is busy looking backwards to deal with leverage or re/financing issues, we have the rare opportunity to look forward to future growth. Part of this will be funded by our signi/ficant headroom and residual c. \u00a31.6bn\n\nOur strong leasing activity drove 3.6% ERV growth, with positive growth across all four segments of our portfolio, re/flecting its enduring appeal to customers. Still, the sharp increase in bond yields over the past 12 months put upwards pressure on valuation yields, leaving our overall portfolio value down 7.7% for the year. Notwithstanding our strong operational results and growth in earnings, EPRA NTA per share therefore was down 11.9% to 936 pence, resulting in a total return on equity of -8.3%.\n\n## Our strategy\n\nOur strategy is focused on three areas Central London o/ffices, major retail destinations and mixed-use urban neighbourhoods. Each of these bene/fits from growing demand for high-quality, sustainable space, which continues to drive rental growth. Whilst the proportions of use di/ffer, there is increasingly more that unites these areas than divides them, as the lines between where people want to work, live and spend their leisure time blur. What binds these areas together is the enduring importance of a sense of place.\n\nWhilst our strategic focus remains the right one, economic and /financial market conditions have changed materially over the past year. Interest rates have risen sharply in response to higher in/flation and credit conditions are tightening, resulting in reduced lending and increased credit margins. It is impossible for us to predict where interest rates will settle over time, but taking a long-term view, it seems clear to us that the ultra-low rates over the prior decade were the aberration, not the adjustment over the past year.",

However, the extent of the opportunity in our o/ffice and mixed-use pipelines, and for accretive external growth, is such that this will likely exceed our own balance sheet capacity over time. Capital discipline remains our priority, so we plan to explore opportunities to enhance our own investment in future growth with other sources of capital, to accelerate our overall growth, capitalise on the platform value we are creating, and enhance our return on equity.\n\n## Creating value through our competitive advantages\n\nOur value creation remains underpinned by our key competitive advantages: our high-quality portfolio; the strength of our customer relationships; and our ability to unlock complex opportunities. Customer demand continues to bifurcate, with growing demand for modern, sustainable space in those locations with the best amenities in London and fewer, but bigger and better stores in key locations in retail. Supply of both is limited, which is driving growth in rental values across our core portfolio.\n\nIn London, where 74% of our portfolio is now located in the vibrant West End and Southwark markets, up from 58% in 2020, we completed \u00a343m of leases, on average 3% above ERV, with a further \u00a36m in solicitors' hands, 19% ahead of ERV. As a result, occupancy increased 110bps to 95.9% and at 99.5% occupancy our West End o/ffices are e/ffectively full - both substantially ahead of the wider market. This drove 4.7% ERV growth, which is at the high end of our guidance. As demand for grade A space remains strong and supply is low, we expect continued low to mid single digit percent ERV growth this year.\n\nAcross our major retail destinations, where we selectively expanded our presence with our investments in Bluewater in late 2021 and St David's in March, we signed \u00a327m of new lettings, on average 8% above ERV. This was 35% higher than the prior year and occupancy of 94.3% was up 110bps during the year, highlighting the value\n\nour revitalised platform and growing brand relationships are starting to drive. Despite cost of living challenges, we continue to see few signs of any let-up in demand for space, with \u00a311m of lettings in solicitors' hands 11% above ERV, up 28% vs this time last year. Our portfolio saw 0.9% ERV growth last year and we expect low to mid single digit percentage ERV growth this year.\n\nOur positive outlook for rental value growth re/flects the high quality of our portfolio, as we expect overall demand for space will continue to rationalise in both retail and o/ffices. We expect this will start to lead to a growing divergence in asset pricing. Investment activity remains thin and so the emerging stabilisation of values in recent months needs to be viewed in that context, yet we expect values for the best assets to stabilise and return to growth well before those where long-term structural demand is questionable.\n\nThis is supplemented by our ability to unlock complex opportunities, such as the discounted purchase of the debt on St David's from two separate lenders; the resolution to grant planning consent we obtained for our 1,800-homes masterplan at Finchley Road; the deal we agreed with our JV partners at May/field, which gives us full control of the /first phase of this unique site; our success at 21 Moor/fields, where our well-timed sale crystallised \u00a3145m of pro/fit on cost; the 17.5-year lease extension with one of our top-10 customers, temporarily moving them across our estate whilst we undertake net-zero upgrade works to their existing o/ffices; or the pre-letting of 60% of our current London pipeline well ahead of ERV.\n\nLooking ahead, this also provides us with a clear competitive advantage in terms of future opportunities. We now have a 1.1m sq ft consented o/ffice pipeline in the West End and Southwark, deliverable into a window of a signi/ficant shortage of sustainable Grade A supply, and we could potentially start on site with two major mixed-use regeneration schemes later this\n\nyear. In addition, we continue to see value in major retail destinations, where asset values have already repriced materially and our di/fferentiated platform provides us with the ability to drive income growth. We also anticipate re/financing events could potentially unearth other opportunities, such as to acquire and upgrade well-located London o/ffices in need of repositioning.\n\n## Driving returns\n\nWe remain decisive in our capital allocation decisions - focusing squarely on the future returns we expect our investments to generate, rather than any historical book value. The \u00a31.4bn of o/ffices we sold during the year are a good example of this. The two principal assets in this had generated an attractive 10% IRR over the period we had held them, but our expected forward return from the price on o/ffer was in the mid-single digits. As this is below our return ambitions and other investment opportunities available to us, such as those outlined above, we decided to sell. We will maintain this clear discipline in the future.\n\nOverall, we now target a total return on equity of 8-10% over time, re/flecting a combination of income returns and capital growth driven by rental value growth and development upside. Short-term market /fluctuations in valuation yields, which are outside of our control, mean that our return on equity is unlikely to be exactly within this range every individual year, as we have seen over the past 12 months, but this return target is what we base our medium-term decisions on.\n\nWithin this, we are focused on growing our high-quality earnings. Income has always been important, but especially so when valuations and hence NTAs re/flect a greater degree of subjectivity, given that market evidence is thin. The fact that since last summer, our disposals made up c. 40% of all investment activity in the City and that there have been no transactions in major retail destinations underlines this. We are already in a strong position on this, with an attractive earnings yield at NTA of over 5%. This has now almost fully absorbed the",

For the past year, this resulted in 4.4% growth in underlying EPRA EPS - towards the high end of our guidance of low to mid single digit growth for the year.\n\nLooking forward, higher interest costs and cost in/flation are a headwind to earnings across every sector, but this is compensated by the strengths of our business and the successful execution of our strategy:\n\n- \u00b7 our long 10.3-year debt maturity, which provides visibility and underpins our sustainability of earnings;\n- \u00b7 our capital recycling out of mature and subscale assets, into developments or acquisitions which o/ffer greater potential to add value and generate higher income and total returns;\n- \u00b7 our growth in like-for-like income, re/flecting the strong demand for our high-quality space, especially from next year onwards once the last historically over-rented leases in retail have reset.\n\nFor the year to March 2024, we expect EPRA EPS to be broadly stable vs last year's underlying level of 50.1 pence, as we expect the positive impact from continued strong operational performance and like-for-like rental growth to be more or less o/ffset by the fact that we have been - and in the near term will likely remain - a net seller of assets. This year we will also see the last over-rented leases in retail resetting, the start-up cost of opening three new Myo locations, and ongoing investment in our systems, which have a combined impact on earnings of c. \u00a310m. We therefore expect EPRA EPS to return to growth for the year to March 2025. As our dividend cover is currently at the high end of our 1.2-1.3x range, we expect our dividend to grow by a low single digit percentage per year over these two years.\n\n## Delivering sustainably\n\nEighteen months ago we were the /first UK REIT to set out a detailed net zero transition investment plan. We continue to progress the implementation of this, as delivery of this plan will ensure we stay ahead of the Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard Regulations, which require a minimum EPC B certi/fication by 2030, as well as other regulatory requirements. So far our work has been focused on optimising building management systems and conducting the detailed design to install air source heat pumps in our o/ffice buildings.\n\n- \u00b7 our portfolio is well-located and its quality is high, which are decisive factors for our customers;\n- \u00b7 our balance sheet strength is sectorleading, with 7.0x net debt/EBITDA and 10.3-year debt maturity;\n- \u00b7 we have sold over \u00a32bn of mature assets, creating capacity to invest in higherreturn opportunities;\n- \u00b7 we have created an attractive and pro/fitable pipeline, with /flexibility on future commitments.\n\nRe/flecting the continued strong demand for our best-in-class space, we expect to see low to mid single digit ERV growth in London and major retail destinations this year. We plan to continue to monetise assets where our ability to add further value is limited, so taking into account that we will likely sell more than we buy in the short term, we expect EPRA EPS for this year to be broadly stable at last year's underlying level, before returning to growth the year after. Having made considerable progress on our strategy over the last couple of years, Landsec is well placed to drive long-term growth and although we are mindful of the wider economic challenges, we are excited about the future.\n\nMark Allan Chief Executive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is on track and the bene/fit of this in terms of higher EPC ratings will start to become visible from 2025 onwards, once our /first new air source heat pumps become operational.\n\nShortly after the year-end, we also updated our carbon reduction targets to align with the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) new Net-Zero Standard, as we remain committed to reaching net zero in the long term. We have committed to a near-term target of reducing our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 47% by 2030 from a 2020 baseline and have committed to reach net zero by 2040 from the same baseline year. This target now covers emissions from all sources, including all of our reported scope 3 emissions such as the emissions from our development pipeline, supply chain and customers.\n\nDuring the year, the energy intensity of our portfolio increased marginally compared to last year, when utilisation was lower in the /first months of the year after the emergence out of lockdown. Still our energy intensity was 16.6% below pre-pandemic levels and 33.2% below our 2013/14 baseline, so we remain /firmly on track to reduce energy intensity by our targeted 45% by 2030. Aside from our net zero investments, we continue to focus on energy e/fficiency measures and have expanded the collaborative work with our largest customers to help them identify ways to save energy.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOur strategy continues to be grounded in our purpose; Sustainable places. Connecting communities. Realising potential. In executing this, we continue to be led by three things: delivering sustainably, delivering for our customers, and being disciplined with our capital.\n\nWe expect global economic and /financial uncertainty to remain elevated in the near future. The transition from a decade of ultra-loose monetary policy to a materially higher rate environment was never going to be a smooth one. The reversal of decades of globalisation and associated in/flationary pressures will also continue to a/ffect economic prospects, for the UK further exacerbated by the impact of Brexit. Positively, the political situation in the UK has stabilised somewhat since late last year and despite all uncertainties, our strategic decisions since late 2020 mean we are in great shape for any eventuality:",

We own highquality o/ffices in London, six regional shopping centres, /five retail outlet centres and a portfolio of mixed-use urban development opportunities in London, Manchester, Glasgow and Cambridge.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The UK real estate market\n\nThe real estate investable market in the UK is estimated to be valued at \u00a3920bn, with assets across a wide range of sectors including o/ffices, industrial, healthcare, retail and residential. Rather than try to invest in all areas, and spread our management focus too thinly, we currently focus on three. These are: Central London o/ffices, Major retail destinations and Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods - areas where we have sources of competitive advantage and expertise to be able to maximise the value from our portfolio.\n\nThe performance of real estate is a combination of the movement in values and rent. Over the last year, global political and economic factors, such as the war in Ukraine and the increase in in/flation and interest rates, have depressed property values as yields have increased as a result of uncertainty and higher policy rates. Conversely, property in general has seen a strong operational recovery as the e/ffects of Covid diminish and the utilisation of physical space has increased.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCentral London o/ffice market - /floor space under o/ffer (Source: CBRE)\n\n5.0\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Central London o/ffices\n\nLondon is well set to continue its position as Europe's pre-eminent global gateway city. It has a unique ecosystem that combines a rich network of world-class universities, renowned research centres, innovative small businesses and global industry players. Alongside its global reach, London's ability to attract and retain talent continues to be a competitive advantage, and its reputation as a safe haven is particularly valuable in times of turmoil.\n\nIt is clear the way people are using o/ffices has changed for the long term. We estimate that changing working patterns and o/ffice use will result in long-term demand for o/ffice space reducing by 20%. However, while overall demand will be lower, we believe the demand for the best-quality space will remain robust. By this, we mean modern, well-con/figured space in great locations, with amenities and excellent sustainability credentials.\n\nThe demand for /flexible space continues to grow as both established and new businesses are looking to occupy space that meets today's /flexible-working needs. Conventional space, occupied over a longer length of lease, will still play a critical role; but successful property companies need to provide a range of spaces o/ffering di/fferent products. Creating workplaces as overt displays of a company's culture, and places that facilitate the bene/fits of collaborating in person, will stimulate creativity and, ultimately, productivity. We expect this trend to continue, alongside the growing requirement to ensure o/ffices meet the minimum credentials for sustainability by 2030. As a result, the divergence in the performance and resilience of the best space, compared with secondary space, is likely to widen.\n\nThe last 12 months have seen a signi/ficant repricing of o/ffice values as yields have increased as a result of higher interest rates and weaker global economic conditions. The occupational market continues to perform well, with take-up of o/ffice space up 6.9% and the vacancy rate reducing to 8.3%.\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nUrban mixed-use is an opportunity area for Landsec. The varied potential uses are supported by long-term trends, and our scale, existing pipeline, and ability to complete complex schemes, mean we are well placed to become a leading player in this market.\n\nThe concept of individual localities (or even potentially buildings) being reserved for a single use is weakening, and there is an increasing desire to see a mix of living, working and leisure within distinct neighbourhoods. The appeal of this further strengthened during the pandemic and we expect it to be sustained, with convenience being a key motivation in a society where time is an increasingly precious commodity.\n\nIn addition, quality of life, health, wellbeing and environmental sustainability are all important themes, and political and societal awareness of these factors has increased considerably in recent times. Done well, mixed-use urban communities can achieve strong returns, as the appeal of the location and amenity increases values across phases of development known as placemaking.\n\nAt the same time, certain areas of cities are rapidly becoming redundant and in need of regeneration. There is increasing political will behind redevelopment projects, but they are complex and there are very few developers with the scale and skills required.\n\nFrom this perspective, developing strong public-sector partnerships is critical to success. Not only are they political stakeholders, but in many cases their participation will be key to accessing development land - with U+I's May/field project in Manchester a case in point.\n\n## Major retail destinations\n\nThe retail market has experienced a number of signi/ficant changes in recent years including the material increase in online retail and the change in consumer habits caused by the pandemic. The current economic environment is also a challenge, with retailers facing higher costs due to in/flation, and consumer disposable income facing pressure from higher energy and food costs, and higher interest rates.\n\nIt is clear there remains too much physical retail space in the UK: perhaps up to 25% of this space will be converted to alternative uses such as leisure or residential space. But physical retail is not dead. The best space is thriving. There is clear consumer demand for shopping centres with an attractive mix of retail, leisure and hospitality, but all these elements must be present for shopping centres to thrive. And brand partners with omnichannel strategies are looking for the right space to support their online businesses.\n\nOne other signi/ficant dramatic change in recent years is the cost of physical spaces compared with online retailing. Physical retail sales have recovered to pre-Covid levels, whereas rents are still c. 35% below their 2017 peak. In addition, the latest rates review came into e/ffect in April this year and this has reduced the rates in retail assets by c. 30%. At the same time, the costs of marketing and delivery for online retail have increased signi/ficantly over the same period.\n\nThe e/ffect of all of these trends is an increase in demand from retailers for physical space in high-quality retail destinations. Over the last 12 months, we have seen this in our shopping centres, with 21 brands upsizing their space, and 14 brands moving from secondary sites to relocate within our centres (a '/flight to prime').\n\nThis demand for physical space has also been seen in shopping patterns. Shoppers are choosing to spend their money in store, rather than online.\n\nAs a result of these trends, we expect investment activity to continue to grow. Shopping centre yields are high compared to other markets and sectors. With the prospect of rental income growth, the future returns look attractive. This provides a cyclical investment opportunity, as there are few investors with both the capital and operational expertise required.",

As the cost of online retail has increased in recent years, physical retail costs - rent and rates - have declined. For many leading brands, online and physical channels are now /firmly inter-connected, so we continue to see existing brands upsize, new brands opening stores in our assets as they move from nearby locations to bene/fit from higher footfall, and digital-native brands opening stores to grow customer connectivity and experience.\n\nConsumer behaviour has gradually reverted to pre-Covid trends, with online sales down and in-store sales growing over the past year. Given the in/flationary pressure on margins for many brands, both online and physical, we expect that the rationalisation of the tail-end of brands' store portfolios will further accelerate. This adds to the challenges for secondary retail locations, where there remains a signi/ficant excess of space, yet brands are focusing on fewer, but bigger and better stores.\n\nTherefore, prime destinations continue to get stronger. With attractive yields and the potential for rental growth, we view prime retail destinations as attractive assets to invest in, albeit the number of centres with long-term potential is limited to a relatively small number of sites.\n\n## Our plan for our retail portfolio\n\nWe will concentrate on catchmentdominant locations we are con/fident will be long-term winners, by o/ffering an experience that draws shoppers time and again. We will sell assets where we do not have scale or sources of competitive advantage: the retail parks from our subscale sector, for example.

We have continued to make strong progress on this, so 2.5 years into this period, we have now sold \u00a32.4bn, including \u00a31.4bn over the past year.\n\nOur largest sale last year was the \u00a3809m disposal of our 21 Moor/fields, EC2 development in September. The building is fully pre-let to Deutsche Bank for 25 years and therefore o/ffered little room to add further value. The sale represented a 9% discount to March book value, partly re/flecting the fact that construction had not yet completed, but crystallised a 25% pro/fit on cost and 11% IRR since we acquired the site.\n\nIn January, we sold One New Street Square, EC4 for \u00a3350m. This building is fully let to Deloitte for a further 14 years and, following a regear of the lease at the start of the year, also o/ffered little to room to add further value. The price was 4% below the September valuation, yet crystallised a 10% IRR since our acquisition of the site in 2005. At the start of the year, we also sold 32-50 Strand, WC2 for \u00a3195m, following a 10-year lease regear with the sole occupier, 15% above its prior book value. In addition, we sold \u00a354m of smaller non-core assets, 22% ahead of book value, and we have now sold or exchanged contracts to sell over half of U+I's non-core assets for \u00a398m, on average 16% above book value.\n\nRelative to \u00a31.4bn of disposals, we spent \u00a3120m on acquisitions and \u00a3280m on development capex last year. Our main purchase was the debt secured on 50% of St David's, Cardi/ff via separate transactions with two lenders. This allowed us to obtain 100% control of the shopping centre at a discount to the \u00a3113m book value of our existing half of the asset and an implied initial and equivalent yield of 9.7%. In addition, we spent a small amount on land assembly deals around some of our major mixed-use projects.",

This means our London assets are now 74% in the West End and Southwark, with City exposure down from 39% to 26% over the year. We are planning further disposals this year, yet we expect future disposal activity to be more balanced towards our subscale sectors.\n\n## Portfolio valuation\n\nThe sharp increase in interest rates during the year meant that transaction volumes across global and UK property markets slowed materially. Yields reset quickly as a result, especially during the second half of 2022. Despite ERV growth across all key segments, this meant the value of our portfolio reduced 7.7%.\n\nThe value of our Central London portfolio was down 7.3% for the year. This re/flected a 42bps increase in yields to 4.9%, which was partly o/ffset by 4.7% growth in ERVs - at the high end of our guidance of low to mid single digit ERV growth for the year.\n\nThe value of our West End o/ffice (-8.0%) and retail and other assets (+1.3%), which make up 74% of our London investment portfolio, proved more resilient than our City o/ffices (-15.4%). This re/flected our strong leasing activity in Victoria, driving 3.7% ERV growth and strong growth at Piccadilly Lights. In the City, where we have sold \u00a31.7bn of o/ffices since late 2020, ERV growth was 4.7%, which solely re/flected a major lease regear at a higher rent at New Street Square, with the associated refurbishment works to facilitate this taken as a cost in the valuation. Development values were down slightly (-3.0%), with ERV growth due to successful lettings o/ffset by softer valuation yields.\n\nThe value of our major retail assets reduced 6.4% during the year, despite our successful leasing activity driving 0.9% ERV growth. Virtually all of this movement occurred in the /final quarter of the 2022 calendar year, as valuers moved yields out by 40bps, mostly based on sentiment, as there were no comparable transactions during the\n\nperiod. We ascribe more value to the continued improvement in operational performance than 'sentiment', so we continue to focus on driving this. Re/flecting the high income return, the total return of our major retail assets was at 0.5% ahead of London (-3.4%) and mixed-use (-2.8%).\n\nIn mixed-use, our completed assets at MediaCity were down 5.9%, as ERV growth of 8.6% was o/ffset by a 61bps increase in yields. Our future developments were down 9.4%, re/flecting the fact that these are mostly valued based on their existing use and we manage the income on a shortterm basis to maximise /flexibility for future development. In Subscale, hotel values were down slightly (-3.1%), whilst retail parks were down 12.1% driven by 69bps yield softening, following a strong 31.9% increase in values during the prior year. The value of our leisure assets was down 17.7% re/flecting concerns around the largest tenant, Cineworld, although the news of its recapitalisation post the year-end is a clear positive.\n\n|

We continue to see a growing bifurcation in demand, with customers focusing on /flexibility, the best quality space in areas with the right amenities to attract key talent, and sustainability. Across the London market, o/ffice take-up slowed in the second half, ending the year at 11.8m sq ft - up 7% vs last year and just 4% below the 10-year average. Space under o/ffer reduced to 3.2m sq ft vs a 10-year average of 3.4m sq ft and vacancy in the City remains high at 11.7%. Conversely, vacancy in the West End, where c. 70% of our assets are located is just 3.6% and down 70bps YoY. Overall, 67% of available space is second-hand, as Grade A vacancy remains low at 1.7%.\n\nRe/flecting the strong demand for the best quality space, we signed 44 lettings and renewals, totalling \u00a343m of rent, on average 3% ahead of valuers' assumptions, with a further \u00a36m in solicitors' hands, 19% above valuers' estimates. This included an upsized, new 17.5-year lease with Taylor Wessing at New Street Square, in a deal where we are temporarily relocating them to a di/fferent building on the estate where we are drawing up plans for medium-term redevelopment, whilst we decarbonise their existing building. In line with our guidance, occupancy increased 110bps to 95.9%, with our West End o/ffices e/ffectively full, at 99.5% occupancy. We continue to see strong demand for our Myo /flexible o/ffer, with 123 Victoria Street 100% let and Dashwood 85% let, vs 98% and 64% a year ago. We plan to open three new Myo locations in autumn, totalling 138,000 sq ft, with a further location to open next summer.\n\nLooking forward, we have been clear in our expectation that more /flexible ways of working would reduce overall demand for o/ffice space in the UK. However, we have also consistently said that the impact of\n\nthis will not be evenly spread, with large HQ type space and areas which lack the amenities that o/ffer people a reason to want to spend time there expected to see a much bigger impact. This has started to play out and we expect this will continue. Across London space marketed for subletting increased to 5.1m sq ft over the year, but 75% of this is in the City, City Fringe and Docklands. In the West End and Southwark, where assets are smaller and occupiers more diversi/fied, demand remains strong and Grade A supply is low. This continues to drive ERV growth for the best assets, which continues to bene/fit our portfolio.\n\n## Major retail destinations\n\nCustomer demand for retail space in the best locations continues to grow. Underlining the value of our major retail destinations for brands and consumers, total retail sales across our portfolio grew 6.9% YoY and like-for-like sales were 4.4% above 2019 levels. Footfall across our shopping centres increased 12% and is now at 90% of pre-pandemic levels, compared to 83% for the UK market and 80% a year ago.\n\nConsumer behaviour continues to gradually revert back to pre-Covid trends, with online sales down and in-store sales up over the past year. For most leading brands, online and physical channels are now /firmly interconnected, and a number of key brands such as Next and Inditex indicated recently that online is no longer expected to grow as quickly as previously anticipated. The increase in cost of capital and cost of doing business online has also led many online pure-play retail models to shift their focus from growing market share to growing pro/fitability, increasing the cost for consumers to buy online.\n\nWhilst we expect brands to continue to rationalise their overall store footprints, their focus on 'fewer, bigger, better' stores continues to drive growth in demand for space in our assets, as they upsize existing stores or open new stores as they move from nearby locations to bene/fit from higher footfall in a '/flight to prime'. Re/flecting this, we completed 218 lettings totalling \u00a327m, up 35% vs the prior year, on average 8% above ERV. Close to 70% of the leases we signed during the year had some\n\n| Operational performance analysis   |   Annualised  rental  income  \u00a3m |   Estimated  rental value \u00a3m | LFL  Occupancy 1 %   | LFL  occupancy  change 1 ppt   | Table 5 WAULT 1  years   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| West End o/ffices                  |                              134 |                          146 | 99.5                 | 1.0                            | 6.4                      |\n| City o/ffices                      |                               61 |                           87 | 90.5                 | 1.2                            | 8.6                      |\n| Retail and other                   |                               42 |                           56 | 95.4                 | 1.5                            | 7.4                      |\n| Developments                       |                                5 |                           57 | n/a                  | n/a                            | n/a                      |\n| Total Central London               |                              242 |                          346 | 95.9                 | 1.1                            | 7.1                      |\n| Shopping centres                   |                              114 |                          123 | 94.7                 | 1.9                            | 4.5                      |\n| Outlets                            |                               56 |                           60 | 93.6                 | (0.2)                          | 3.0                      |\n| Total Major retail                 |                              170 |                          183 | 94.3                 | 1.1                            | 4.1                      |\n| Completed investment               |                               24 |                           26 | 97.8                 | 1.8                            | 9.2                      |\n| Developments                       |                               28 |                           31 | n/a                  | n/a                            | n/a                      |\n| Total Mixed-use urban              |                               52 |                           57 | 97.8                 | 1.8                            | 9.2                      |\n| Leisure                            |                               51 |                           50 | 95.5                 | (1.0)                          | 10.3                     |\n| Hotels                             |                               31 |                           28 | n/a                  | n/a                            | 8.2                      |\n| Retail parks                       |                               28 |                           30 | 98.6                 | 2.1                            | 4.7                      |\n| Total Subscale sectors             |                              110 |                          108 | 97.7                 | 0.3                            |                          |\n| Total Combined Portfolio           |                              574 |                          694 | 95.8                 | 0.7                            | 8.0 6.5                  |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "turnover linkage, although the average turnover element was only 10% of the total rent. Overall, 53% of our leases now have some turnover component, with turnover rent making up 12% of our total retail income. This turnover data provides us with valuable insights and a unique competitive advantage in underwriting income levels.\n\nAs a result, occupancy increased 110bps during the year to 94.3%. We continue to monitor credit risks, but units in administration remain low at 0.4%, vs 0.5% a year ago. There have been no CVAs and minimal insolvencies, as the most challenged businesses already folded during the pandemic. Whilst Cineworld (less than 1% of annual rent in major retail destinations), /filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US during the year, it continues to trade and pay rent and agreed a recapitalisation shortly after the year-end.\n\nLooking forward, despite the cost of living challenges consumers are faced with, we continue to see few signs of any let-up in demand from brands, with \u00a311m of lettings in solicitors' hands, up 28% vs this time last year, on average 11% above ERV. With sales in our shopping centres close to pre-pandemic levels and rents having reset c. 35% during the pandemic, operational pro/fitability for brands further improved due to the c. 30% reduction in business rates last month. With the last large over-rented historical leases expected to reset this year, this is expected to underpin solid like-for-like income growth from next year.\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nOur completed investment assets in mixed-use at present solely comprise our investment in MediaCity, where occupancy increased 1.8% to 97.8%, with lettings well ahead of ERV. The bulk of the income in our mixed-use development assets relate to our\n\nthree shopping centres in London and Glasgow. This income is managed on a short-term basis to maximise our /flexibility for future development. This will eventually erode and be replaced by our new schemes, but in the near term it compensates for the holding costs of these sites as we prepare them for future development.\n\n## Subscale sectors\n\nAcross our subscale portfolio, operational performance remained robust. We completed \u00a37m of retail park and leisure lettings, 10% above valuers' assumptions, with a further \u00a31m of rent in solicitors' hands, 5% above valuers' assumptions, and overall occupancy increased 30bps. Our hotels, which are fully let to Accor, saw occupancy rise to 94% of pre-Covid levels, up from 67% last year, driving a substantial increase in RevPAR.\n\n## Development pipeline\n\n## Central London\n\nDemand for the best quality space remains strong. Our two on-site West End schemes, n2 in Victoria and Lucent behind Piccadilly Lights, are set to complete shortly and are 73% and 71% pre-let or in solicitors' hands respectively, with rents agreed over the last 12 months on average 11% ahead of ERV. At the end of March, we completed The Forge, in Southwark. Our Myo /flexible o/ffering will operate 35% of this space and is set to open in autumn, and we are now in solicitors' hands on 11% of the remaining space. Combined, these three projects are expected to generate an ERV of \u00a339m once fully let, which will support our near-term income growth.\n\nDuring the year, we sold our development at 21 Moor/fields in the City, which we fully pre-let to Deutsche Bank, for \u00a3809m, ahead of its completion. This crystallised a 25% pro/fit on cost and 11% IRR since our acquisition of the site in 2012.\n\nAs expected, we are seeing a slowdown in new development starts across the London market, re/flecting the increase in construction and /finance costs, but also the decline in available development /finance. In previous periods of economic uncertainty, new development starts ended up c. 30-90% below originally expected levels and we believe this is likely to repeat this time. As demand for the best, most sustainable space remains strong, this creates an attractive window for us to deliver new space in 2025, when Grade A supply is expected to be very low.\n\nLast autumn, we decided to commit to the early works for the refurbishment of Portland House, SW1 and Timber Square, SE1. At a cost of \u00a355m, this allowed us to maintain our programme for a delivery in late 2025, whilst keeping /flexibility on the residual c. \u00a3400m of capex at a time of high /financial and political uncertainty. Returns on both projects remain attractive, with gross yields on cost of 7.4% and a yield on capex of 12%+, so supported by the strong leasing success in our current pipeline, with recent lettings 11% ahead of ERV, we therefore plan to commit to the full works on both imminently.\n\nWe also continue to progress our future pipeline, as we received planning consent for Red Lion Court, SE1 in March; are currently seeking to enhance our existing consent at Liberty of Southwark, SE1; and unlocked a future opportunity at Southwark Bridge Road, SE1 adjacent to The Forge, through a lease surrender we agreed in the second half of the year. This further adds to the potential to create a unique cluster of highly sustainable o/ffices in Southwark, which is one of the most attractive areas of London in terms of amenities. All combined, this provides us with a 2.0m sq ft future pipeline, of which 1.1m sq ft is now consented.\n\n| Property   | Sector                     |   Size  sq ft '000 | Estimated  completion   date   |   Net income/ ERV \u00a3m |   Market  value  \u00a3m |   Costs to  complete \u00a3m |   Market  value +  future TDC  \u00a3m |   Gross yield  on MV +  future TDC % |\n|------------|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Lucent, W1 | O/ffice/retail/residential |                144 | Aug-23                         |                   15 |                 270 |                      23 |                               293 |                                  5.1 |\n| n2, SW1    | O/ffice                    |                165 | Jun-23                         |                   14 |                 229 |                      21 |                               250 |                                  5.7 |\n| Total      |                            |                309 |                                |                   29 |                 499 |                      44 |                               543 |                                  5.4 |",

Gross yield on cost adjusted for residential TDC.\n\n## Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods\n\nConsumer expectations on how we live, work and spend our leisure time continue to evolve and demands on sustainability continue to grow, which means there is a structural need to remodel many parts of the built environment, to make sure they are /fit for future needs. Located in attractive locations with strong transport links in some of the fastest growing urban areas in the UK, our pipeline is well placed to cater for this. The combination of U+I's placemaking skills and Landsec's sustainability and development expertise means we now have the platform to both deliver and curate thriving mixed-use places and realise the long-term sustainable value from the future opportunities we have created.\n\nOur 10m sq ft mixed-use pipeline in London, Glasgow and Manchester has a total development cost of c. \u00a35bn, with a mix of residential, o/ffice and leisure space deliverable across multiple phases over the next 10-15 years. The current book value of these sites is modest compared to its potential upside, at c. \u00a3330m, and given the c. 5% income yield on the current use of the existing assets, its holding cost is modest.\n\nWith unlevered IRR targets in the low to mid-teens, this o/ffers valuable optionality for growth.\n\nWe have made excellent progress during the year at our two most advanced projects, which provides optionality to potentially start /first works on site over the next 12 months. At May/field, next to Manchester's main train station, the new 6.5-acre public park opened in September and we agreed terms with our JV partners for a drawdown of land for the /first phases of development. This allows us to develop 100% of the /first phase, covering around one-third of the overall project, ourselves and therefore paves the way for a potential start on site with the /first two o/ffice buildings totalling 320,000 sq ft later this year. The expected investment for this is c. \u00a3150m, with an expected gross yield on cost of c. 8%.\n\nAt Finchley Road, in zone two, London, we secured a resolution to grant planning consent at the end of March for our masterplan to develop 1,800 new homes. Subject to further planning and land assembly workstreams being satisfactorily progressed, this could allow us to start on\n\nsite with enabling works for our /first major residential scheme later this year.\n\nIn Glasgow, we intend to submit the planning application for our mixed-use masterplan shortly, which we expect to be determined in the /first half of 2024. In Lewisham, south-east London, we maintain positive engagement with the Council on our new residential-led masterplan, for which we are preparing to submit a planning application later this year. At MediaCity, we are working with our partner Peel on establishing the long-term vision for this site, ahead of the future phases of its development.\n\nOur good progress during the year has further added to the valuable opportunity to build an attractive balance of income, development upside and medium-term growth potential our pipeline provides. The mixed-use nature, ability to phase capex, geographic spread of the pipeline, and the /flexibility to adapt to changes in demand all add to the balanced risk-pro/file of this part of our business.",

reduction in energy intensity compared to 2019/20. This was up 0.9% year-on-year, although this largely re/flected particularly low utilisation in the prior year in the early months of emergence from the pandemic. At current levels, it is 33.2% below 2013/14 levels and therefore remains on track vs our target to reduce energy intensity by 45% from this baseline by 2030.\n\nAt the start of this year, we updated our carbon reduction targets to align with the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) new Net-Zero Standard. Landsec was amongst the /first companies worldwide to have our science-based targets validated under the Net-Zero Standard, which is the world's /first framework for corporate net-zero target setting. In response to the new SBTi standard, and in recognition of progress to date, we have committed to a near-term target of reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions by 47% by 2030 from a 2020 base year and have committed to reach net zero by 2040 from the same base year. This signi/ficantly increases the scope of our targets, as it now includes emissions from all sources, including all of our scope 3 emissions such as the emissions from our development pipeline, supply chain and customers.\n\nIn late 2021 we were the /first UK property company to launch our fully costed net zero carbon transition plan. This plan will see us deliver our science-based target and meet the Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard of EPC B by 2030, with the expected cost for this already re/flected in our current portfolio valuation. 36% of our portfolio is already rated B or higher, including 38% of our o/ffice portfolio. The latter is down from 44% last year, partly re/flecting the sale of One New Street Square. We expect this to increase to 44% in the coming months once our current pipeline completes and this will increase further from 2025 onwards, as the bene/fits from our net zero transition investment kicks in.\n\n- Bluewater,  Kent\n\nWe remain on track with this plan and have now completed air source heat pump feasibility studies for six o/ffices, with four progressing to concept design and two to detailed design. We have also completed the optimisation of building management systems for 11 o/ffices, and will be completing this for two of our shopping centres this year. In addition, we have expanded our energy audits from 15 to 25 of our largest customers, which combined cover 19% of the energy use in our o/ffice portfolio. This identi/fied potential annual carbon and costs savings of 10-15% per customer and we plan to expand this to the next 12 customers this year.\n\n- May/field, Manchester",

We are already tracking an average 36% reduction in upfront embodied carbon across our future pipeline, which equates to an average upfront embodied carbon intensity of 640kgCO 2 e/m 2 on our o/ffices and 535kgCO 2 e/m 2 for residential. To help us achieve our longer-term targets, during the year we signed up to the ConcreteZero Initiative where we commit to using 100% net zero concrete by 2050 with ambitious interim targets. This complements our existing membership of the SteelZero Initiative and sends a clear signal of our commitment to net zero to our supply chain.\n\nNear-term, at Timber Square, SE1 our plans show upfront embodied carbon intensity of 535kgCO 2 e/m 2 , re/flecting the retention of part of the existing structure, a highly\n\noptimised design and the use of low carbon cross-laminated timber. At Portland House, SW1, retaining the existing structure and upgrading the existing fa\u00e7ade has resulted in upfront embodied carbon intensity of 395kgCO 2 e/m 2 . At Red Lion Court, SE1 we expect an upfront embodied carbon intensity of  c. 600kgCO 2 e/m 2 , re/flecting the retention of 35-40% of the existing basement and piles and the use of a highly /flexible concrete structural solution with demountable timber in/fills.

This includes a bursary programme that provides /financial support to underrepresented young adults studying for a placemaking career, internships within Landsec and a small grants programme for local charities and community organisations in the areas we operate.\n\n## Creating the right culture and investing in our platforms\n\nOur strong operational performance and continued progress on executing our strategy over the past year clearly re/flects the capability and dedication of the substantial talent within Landsec. We continue to work on creating the right culture and a more diverse organisation, which is key in getting the most out of the valuable skills and expertise our teams harbour and in successfully delivering our strategy over time.\n\nWith this in mind, we initiated an organisational review early last year aimed at reducing internal complexity and becoming more agile, customer-orientated and outward focused. This work built on previous changes in our retail team, where we brought in signi/ficant experience and capabilities from international retailer backgrounds to focus more on growing brand relationships and guest experience, and our focus on retaining the unique placemaking and design capability of U+I during its successful integration over the past 12 months.\n\nAs a result of this organisational review, we made several changes, including to our leadership team. We also reduced the number of layers in our organisation and increased management reporting spans. This has improved our e/fficiency and freed up resource to focus more on activities which drive value for our customers, rather than on internal processes. In a sector\n\nwhich is rapidly becoming more operational, this further underpins the value of our operating platforms and their future growth potential.\n\nDespite high in/flation, this also meant we managed to keep overhead costs /flat over the past 12 months and although in/flationary pressures remain elevated, we expect overhead cost to be down slightly for the current year. In early 2022 we also initiated signi/ficant investments in upgrading our systems and data capability. We incurred \u00a36m of cost for this during the year and expect a broadly similar cost in the current year, but this is set to drive further e/fficiency improvements for the year to March 2025 onwards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Internally, management reviews the Group's results on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.2bn, is an example of this approach, re/flecting our economic interest in our properties regardless of our ownership structure.\n\nOur key measure of underlying earnings performance is EPRA earnings, which represents the underlying /financial performance of the Group's property rental business, which is our core operating activity. A full de/finition of EPRA earnings is given in the Glossary. This measure is based on the Best Practices Recommendations of the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) which are metrics widely used across the industry to aid comparability and includes our proportionate share of joint ventures' earnings. Similarly, EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share is our primary measure of net asset value.\n\nMeasures presented on a proportionate basis are alternative performance measures as they are not de/fined under IFRS. This presentation provides additional information to stakeholders on the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements. For further details see table 70 in the Business analysis section.\n\n## Overview\n\nGlobal economic and /financial market conditions have changed considerably over the past year. The volatility this caused has, unsurprisingly, a/ffected the valuation of property and other asset classes across the globe, but we have continued to focus on driving operational performance and executing our strategy. Our success in this during the year has further strengthened our strong balance sheet and quality of earnings and underpins our con/fidence in our ability to grow earnings and dividend over time.\n\nEPRA earnings for the year were up 10.7% to \u00a3393m, partly due to an increase in surrender premiums received, which were up \u00a322m vs the prior year. The two main surrenders unlocked the opportunity for a major 17.5-year lease regear elsewhere in our estate and two medium term developments. Like-for-like gross rental income excluding these surrender premiums was up 6.0%, or 5.8% on a net rental income basis. This re/flects our strong leasing, growth in turnover income in major retail destinations, higher variable income and continued growth in income across our hotel portfolio.\n\nDespite our signi/ficant disposals, underlying EPRA EPS, which excludes the 3.0 pence impact of the increase in surrender premiums, rose 4.4% to 50.1 pence, towards the high end of our guidance for low to mid single digit percentage growth. In line with growth in underlying earnings, our 38.6 pence dividend for the year is up 4.3% vs the prior year. This re/flects a dividend cover of 1.30x, in line with our policy to have dividends annually covered 1.2 to 1.3 times.\n\nAlthough our successful leasing activity drove growth in occupancy and ERVs, the value of our portfolio was down \u00a3848m as a result of an increase in valuation yields, re/flecting the rise in bond yields during the year. Despite our growth in EPRA earnings, this resulted in an overall loss before tax of \u00a3622m and basic EPS of -83.6 pence, compared to a pro/fit of \u00a3875m in the prior year. As a result, EPRA NTA per share reduced 11.9% to 936 pence, which including dividends paid, resulted in a total return on equity of -8.3%.",

        "page_content": "Despite this, our decisive action during the year further strengthened our strong capital base. We reduced net debt by \u00a30.9bn to \u00a33.3bn, so despite the reduction in value of our portfolio, our LTV is down from 34.4% to 31.7%. This is an imperfect measure to judge leverage, particularly so when investment activity is low and the approach to valuations varies widely in di/fferent markets, which is why in times like this we focus more on net debt/EBITDA as a cash-on-cash measure. This stood at 7.0x\n\nat the end of March, down from 9.7x a year ago, or 8.0x on a weighted average net debt basis, down from 8.6x twelve months ago. We increased our average debt maturity to 10.3 years and with \u00a32.4bn of undrawn facilities, we have no need to re/finance any maturing debt until 2026, so our balance sheet is in excellent shape.\n\n## Income statement\n\nOur successful leasing activity and the high quality of our portfolio is clearly re/flected in\n\nthe growth in income we have delivered. Compared to the prior year, when the UK was just emerging out of lockdown at the start of the period, this growth has been most prevalent in our major retail destinations; our mixed-use assets, where some of our future projects have an existing retail use; and our subscale sectors, which include our retail parks, leisure and hotels, as trading in these areas returned to normal.\n\n| Income statement 1                                                    | Table 9             | Table 9          | Table 9              | Table 9              | Table 9   | Table 9             | Table 9          | Table 9              | Table 9              | Table 9   | Table 9   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                                       | Central  London  \u00a3m | Major  retail \u00a3m | Mixed- use  urban \u00a3m | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Central  London  \u00a3m | Major  retail \u00a3m | Mixed- use  urban \u00a3m | Subscale  sectors \u00a3m | Total  \u00a3m | Change \u00a3m |\n| Gross rental income 2                                                 | 310                 | 171              | 57                   | 109                  | 647       | 289                 | 161              | 43                   | 93                   | 586       | 61        |\n| Net service charge expense                                            | (1)                 | (8)              | (2)                  | (1)                  | (12)      | (1)                 | (6)              | (2)                  | (3)                  | (12)      | -

This increase re/flects a lease surrender we agreed at Southwark Bridge Road to create optionality for a new redevelopment, adjacent to our recent scheme at The Forge, and the lease restructuring with Deloitte at New Street Square we agreed at the start of the year.\n\nThe space this freed up paved the way for another lease regear with a di/fferent major customer at the estate and the successful disposal of One New Street Square in January.\n\nExcluding the increase in surrender premiums, like-for-like gross rental income was up \u00a329m, or 6.0%. This included a \u00a319m increase in variable rent, which comprises income from hotels, Piccadilly Lights, parking and retail turnover rent, as trading normalised relative to the pandemic e/ffects in the prior year.\n\nOverall net rental income for the year increased by \u00a351m to \u00a3561m. The reversal of our bad and doubtful debt provisions was \u00a33m, compared to \u00a312m in the prior year. Direct property expenditure increased by \u00a31m, which re/flects a \u00a37m increase due to acquisitions, o/ffset by a \u00a36m decrease in direct property costs elsewhere in the portfolio. This re/flects the bene/fit of increased occupancy and our focus on costs. Net service charge expenditure was stable compared to the prior year.",

We expect this to improve on a like-for-like basis, as void and letting costs reduce as occupancy continues to grow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHowever, we expect the overall margin to reduce slightly this year, re/flecting the start-up cost of opening three new Myo locations and the initial lease-up cost of our three London o/ffice developments which will be completed by this summer.\n\nRent collections remain strong and are currently in line with this time last year and pre-Covid levels. We have seen minimal\n\ninsolvencies and no CVAs during the period, although Cineworld, which makes up 2.0% of our annual rent, entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. We have taken appropriate provisions during the year and its recently announced recapitalisation now provides a positive step forward, whilst all units in our portfolio continue to trade and the company continues to pay rent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1.

Gross rental income on a like-for-like basis and the impact of developments, acquisitions and disposals exclude surrender premiums received.\n\n## Net administrative expenses\n\nDespite the surge in UK in/flation, our net administrative expenses were stable vs the prior year at \u00a384m, in line with our guidance. This includes the full absorption of the additional administrative cost of the U+I acquisition at the end of 2021 and re/flects our continued focus on making sure our cost base is right. This also includes \u00a36m of costs re/flecting an investment in upgrading our systems and data capability, which based on updated IFRIC accounting guidance is now expensed instead of capitalised. This is expected to reduce from the year to March 2025, as this investment programme completes during that year.\n\nAlthough high wage in/flation and general cost in/flation continue to put upward pressure on costs, we expect administrative expenses for this year to be down slightly. This re/flects the e/fficiency bene/fits of the organisational review we undertook last year. We have identi/fied clear opportunities to reduce costs the years after, partly driven by our investments in technology, so we remain on track to reduce our EPRA cost ratio towards the low 20's over time, compared to 25.2% last year and 26.4% in the prior year.\n\n## Net /finance expenses\n\nNet interest costs increased \u00a313m to \u00a384m, principally due to higher gross borrowings in the /first half of the year, ahead of disposals during the year, plus an increase in variable interest rates. At the start of last year, 70% of our borrowings were /fixed or hedged but following our disposals, we are now fully hedged. We expect net interest costs to increase slightly in the current year, re/flecting a small increase in average borrowing costs.",

This is predominantly due to the fair value movements of our interest-rate swaps as a result of the increase in interest rates over the period.\n\n## Valuation of investment properties and loss on disposals\n\nThe independent external valuation of our Combined Portfolio showed a \u00a3848m value reduction. Whilst the strong leasing evidence we created drove 3.6% ERV\n\ngrowth and we delivered further pro/fits on our current development pipeline, the upside of this was more than o/ffset by a market-wide softening of yields due to the sharp rise in bond yields.\n\nWe recognised a \u00a3144m loss on disposals, mostly re/flecting the discounts to historical book value on the sale of 21 Moor/fields and One New Street Square, partly o/ffset by the premiums to book value of the sale of 32-50 Strand and a leisure asset in north London.\n\n## IFRS loss after tax\n\nSubstantially all our activity during the year was covered by UK REIT legislation, which means our tax charge for the year remained\n\n| Balance sheet 1                                                           | 31 March  2023 \u00a3m   | Table 11 31 March  2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| Combined Portfolio                                                        | 10,239              | 12,017                       |\n| Adjusted net debt                                                         | (3,287)             | (4,179)                      |\n| Other net assets/(liabilities)                                            | 15                  | 50                           |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets                                                  | 6,967               | 7,888                        |\n| Shortfall of fair value over net investment in /finance leases book value | 6                   | 6                            |\n| Other intangible asset                                                    | 2                   | 2                            |\n| Excess of fair value over trading properties book value                   | (12)                | -                            |\n| Fair value of interest-rate swaps                                         | 42                  | 21                           |\n| Net assets, excluding amounts due to non-controlling interests            | 7,005               | 7,917                        |\n| Net assets per share                                                      | 945p                | 1,070p                       |\n| EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share (diluted)                              | 936p                | 1,063p                       |\n\n- 1.

This remains well within our target range of 25% to 40% and in line with the low 30's level we said we expected for the foreseeable future.\n\n| Net debt and leverage Table 13      | Net debt and leverage Table 13   | Net debt and leverage Table 13   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                     | 31 March  2023 \u00a3m                | 31 March  2022 \u00a3m                |\n| Net debt                            | \u00a33,348m                          | \u00a34,254m                          |\n| Adjusted net debt 1                 | \u00a33,287m                          | \u00a34,179m                          |\n| Interest cover ratio                | 4.5x                             | 4.9x                             |\n| Net debt/EBITDA  (period-end)       | 7.0x                             | 9.7x                             |\n| Net debt/EBITDA  (weighted average) | 8.0x                             | 8.6x                             |\n| Group LTV 1                         | 31.7%                            | 34.4%                            |\n| Security Group LTV                  | 33.0%                            | 36.4%                            |\n\n- 1.

Our MTN and bank loans form part of our Security Group, which provide security on a /floating pool of assets currently valued at \u00a39.6bn. This provides /flexibility to include or exclude assets and an attractive cost of funding, with our MTN currently rated AA and AA- with a stable outlook respectively by S&P and Fitch.\n\nThe Security Group structure has a number of tiered covenants. Below 65% LTV, these involve very limited operational restrictions, whilst a default only occurs when LTV is more than 100% or the ICR falls below 1.0 times.\n\nWith a Security Group LTV of 33.0%, down from 36.4% in March, our portfolio could withstand a c. 50% fall in value before we reach the 65% hurdle and 67% before reaching 100%, whilst our EBITDA could fall 78% before we reach 1.0x ICR.\n\nWe have \u00a32.4bn of undrawn facilities, which provides substantial /flexibility. The amount of borrowings which is /fixed or hedged increased from 70% to 100%, as we used the proceeds from our signi/ficant disposals during the period to repay part of our /floating debt, as planned. We expect this /figure to come down slightly as we repay some of our near-term maturities and continue to target a medium-term range of c. 80-90% to keep some /flexibility for potential divestments.\n\nIn March, we issued our /first Green bond, which is earmarked for the investment in our near-term London pipeline. This raised \u00a3400m with a 9.5 year maturity at a margin of 133bps, representing an all-in cost of 4.875%. Combined with the reduced utilisation of our revolving credit facilities, this increased our average maturity of debt from 9.1 to 10.3 years, even though our average cost of debt only rose slightly, to 2.7%.\n\nWe have \u00a3733m of debt maturing in the next two and a half years, but all of this is more than covered by existing undrawn facilities, which means we have no re/financing requirements until 2026.\n\n| Available facilities 1                    | 31 March  2023 \u00a3m   | Table 15 31 March  2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|\n| Medium Term Notes                         | 2,736               | 2,341                        |\n| Drawn bank debt                           | 310                 | 1,519                        |\n| Outstanding commercial paper              | 312                 | 499                          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents 2               | (74)                | (172)                        |\n| Available undrawn facilities 2            | 2,386               | 1,134                        |\n| Total committed credit facilities         | 2,934               | 2,980                        |\n| Weighted average maturity of debt         | 10.3 years          | 9.1 years                    |\n| Percentage of borrowings /fixed or hedged | 100%                | 70%                          |\n| Weighted average cost of debt             | 2.7%                | 2.4%                         |\n\n- 1.

Cash and cash equivalents and available undrawn facilities have been restated as at 31 March 2022 following a clari/fication by IFRIC on classi/fication of funds with externally imposed restrictions.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLooking ahead, our strong capital base puts us in an excellent position to take advantage of opportunities which will no doubt arise as the world continues to adjust to the new reality of higher interest rates and tighter credit conditions. Our strong credit pro/file and long 10.3-year average debt maturity therefore provide clear visibility and underpin the resilience of our attractive earnings pro/file.\n\nWe now target to deliver an 8-10% annual return on equity over time, driven by a combination of growing income returns and capital growth from rental value growth and development upside. Short term changes in valuation yields remain beyond\n\nour control, which means we will not land precisely in this range every single year, but our high-quality portfolio and the clear competitive advantages of our operating platforms mean we are well placed to deliver this over time. For the current year, we expect continued customer demand to drive low to mid single digit growth in ERVs in London and major retail destinations.\n\nWe expect EPRA EPS for the current year to be broadly stable vs last year's 50.1 pence underlying EPS. This re/flects the fact that we expect the positive impact from continued strong operational performance and like-for-like rental growth to be more or less o/ffset by the fact that we have been - and in the near term will likely remain -\n\n net seller of assets. It also fully absorbs c. \u00a310m of impact from the last over-rented retail leases resetting, Myo start-up costs and IT systems investment this year. As such, we expect EPRA EPS to return to growth the year after. As our current dividend cover is at the high end of our 1.2-1.3x target range, we expect dividends to grow by a low single digit percentage p.a. over these two years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVanessa Simms Chief Financial O/fficer",

Alongside this transformation, we've created a suite of development products designed to hone the skills, capabilities and experiences that will set our people apart, and equip us for growth.\n\n## Listening to our people\n\nWe know it is critical to listen to every employee's voice, and use that feedback to continually improve our business. We launched a new employee survey, where we are able to benchmark our results with other organisations based on size or sector. This has given us some clear insights that will allow us to identify areas of strength and areas for improvement. Questions focused on the key employee viewpoints that underpin engagement and allowed us to explore our culture.\n\n75% of our colleagues responded, with an overall engagement score of 77% across the business (see chart 16).

We have developed a shared vision that articulates why D&I is important to Landsec, and what we want to achieve:\n\n'We design, develop and manage more inclusive, commercially successful places through attracting and nurturing diverse talent within a culture that enables everyone to reach their full potential.'\n\nWe will achieve this vision through actions grouped under three pillars, nine D&I themes and foundations that support the overall delivery:\n\norganisations.

This will involve de-biasing role descriptions, mandating ethnic and gender diversity on shortlists, and including an employee panel in the assessment process.\n- \u00b7 We launched the Landsec Futures internship programme to enhance social mobility within our business and, more broadly, within the wider real estate industry.\n\n## Inclusive culture\n\n- \u00b7 Our a/ffinity networks continue to have an important voice in our business in advising how we shape our culture, and this year played a part in improving support for colleagues through some of the most challenging life milestones.\n\n## Inclusive places\n\n- \u00b7 We are implementing a D&I procurement and supply chain strategy with three core objectives, increasing the diversity of our supply chain, improving D&I practices within our supply chain, and working with suppliers who can support us in delivering our strategy. We have included speci/fic D&I training requirements in contractual speci/fications, made the latest guidance on designing for neurodiversity part of our design brief for a major way/finding contract, and worked with our supply chain partners to develop a diversity plan for our Timber Square development.\n\n## Foundations\n\n- \u00b7 Our revised commitments and actions are led by data and evidence of what works. We have introduced improved dashboards, helping us to know workforce diversity by business unit and level, but also to understand recruitment, promotion and turnover trends, to inform\n\nwhere we need to change. This has led to a greater focus on diversity at leader level and above, in our targets and priorities, which are proving to make a di/fference, like including multiple women in shortlists for leadership positions.\n\n- \u00b7 We will be transparent about our work, publishing annually our progress towards our targets. To support accountability for this, our Executive Leadership Team members have annual diversity targets in their performance plans, linked to their bonuses. These targets focus on diversity at leadership, with KPIs relating to increasing diversity in succession plans and talent development programmes, and for reducing senior leavers we would wish to retain.\n\n## A/ffinity networks\n\nIn support of our D&I objectives, we want to hear all voices across the Company, and so we continue to work closely with our four a/ffinity networks to ensure we get feedback from all perspectives.

The exhibition allowed our workforce to learn more about the LGBTQ+ movement in the UK, highlighting the progress made to date but also raising awareness of the work still to do.\n- \u00b7 We hosted Oxford Pride at Westgate opening the doors of our centre for the celebrations of the local LGBTQ+ community.\n\n## Diaspora Network\n\n- \u00b7 Led a series of events during Black History Month, including hosting black business owners' pop-up markets across a number of Landsec sites and facilitating an event with our partners to celebrate black art and culture and showcase black excellence in music, poetry, comedy, art and food.\n- \u00b7 Ran a three-day event with Somerset Multicultural Association, Clarks and UNTHNKBLE to celebrate Black History Month.",

We plan to report our 2023 pay gap /figures later this year. While we made progress in some areas in 2022 - notably in reducing our gender pay gap - we went backwards on our ethnicity pay gaps. Pay gap reporting not only supports transparency, it also helps us to identify the actions we need to take to address these gaps. Further details of our actions are available at Landsec.com.\n\nOur mean gender pay gap reduced from 36.6% to 30.8% in 2022 and our median gender pay gap reduced from 29.3% to 28.7% over the same period. This reduction in the gender pay gap is primarily due to increases in the representation of women in the upper middle pay quartile (1.7 percentage point increase) and upper pay quartile (2.9 percentage point increase) over the past 12 months. This is a result of a higher number of male leavers in the upper pay quartile than joiners and an increase in female representation at executive level.\n\nOur mean ethnicity pay gap increased from 32.7% to 36.5% in 2022 and our median ethnicity pay gap increased from 27.6% to 37.6% in the same period.\n\nOur ethnicity pay gaps have increased because the representation of ethnic minority sta/ff has increased in the lowest pay quartile and decreased in all other pay quartiles. This is due to a high proportion of ethnic minority new starters at our more junior levels - 50-70% of new starters at these levels over the past 12 months are from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nDuring the same period, we had a higher proportion of ethnic minority sta/ff leave the business at manager level and this decreased ethnic minority representation within these more senior roles. This points to the importance of our a/ffinity networks and the need for us to increase our focus on retention.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                              |     |       |        |                                     |                                     |                                     | Table 23                            |\n|------------------------------|-----|-------|--------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                              |     |       |        | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean) | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean) | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean) | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean) |\n| Quartile proportions         | No. | Male  | Female | Total Avg                           | Male                                | Female                              | % Gap                               |\n| Lower Income Quartile        | 133 | 30.8% | 69.2%  | \u00a317.65                              | \u00a317.34                              | \u00a317.78                              | -2.53%                              |\n| Lower Middle Income Quartile | 133 | 42.9% | 57.1%  | \u00a327.96                              | \u00a329.01                              | \u00a327.16                              | 6.37%                               |\n| Upper Middle Income Quartile | 133 | 53.4% | 46.6%  | \u00a340.47                              | \u00a340.26                              | \u00a340.72                              | -1.15%                              |\n| Upper Income Quartile        | 133 | 69.9% | 30.1%  | \u00a383.81                              | \u00a385.64                              | \u00a379.54                              | 7.12%                               |\n\n## Ethnicity pay gap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                              |     |       |                  |                     | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)   | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)   | Quartile split (hourly rate - mean)   |\n|------------------------------|-----|-------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Quartile proportions         | No. | White | Ethnic  minority | Prefer  not  to say | Total  Avg                            | Ethnic  minority                      | White % Gap                           |\n| Lower Income Quartile        | 133 | 70.7% | 29.3%            |                     | 0.0% \u00a317.65 \u00a317.34 \u00a316.77             |                                       | 3.30%                                 |\n| Lower Middle Income Quartile | 133 | 75.9% | 22.6%            |                     | 1.5% \u00a327.96 \u00a329.01 \u00a328.07             |                                       | 3.24%                                 |\n| Upper Middle Income Quartile | 133 | 90.2% | 9.0%             |                     |                                       |                                       | 0.8% \u00a340.47 \u00a340.26 \u00a340.98 -1.80%      |\n| Upper Income Quartile        | 133 | 89.5% | 6.8%             |                     |                                       |                                       | 3.7% \u00a383.81 \u00a385.64 \u00a365.72 23.26%      |",

This year, we have focused particularly on building future talent through the launch of our Internship scheme, Landsec Futures, which aims to provide opportunities in the real estate industry to those from diverse backgrounds. This scheme received overwhelming interest, with 75 applicants, and introduced some fantastic talent to opportunities within our sector. This year, we will welcome seven individuals into our business, creating aspirations and opportunities for fresh new talent.

As the war in Europe continues to disrupt livelihoods and global supply chains, including energy, and the fact that 2022 was the /fifth-hottest year on record, The World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report 20231 has identi/fied the cost-of-living crisis and failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change as two of the major global risks for the next decade. Addressing these risks requires action from government, non-governmental organisations, media, individuals and purpose-led businesses like Landsec. In addition, our customers are also increasingly aware of these issues, and demanding an exemplary approach to sustainability.\n\nIt is therefore critical that we continue to focus on achieving our vision, embedding our Build well, Live well, Act well (BWLWAW) framework across our organisation - to help balance the needs of our stakeholders with positive environmental and social impact. This year, we've maintained our focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 driving down operational carbon emissions through our net zero transition investment plan and striving to meet our ambitious embodied carbon targets\n- \u00b7 maintaining our prudent approach to energy procurement to protect our customers from rising energy costs\n- \u00b7 supporting the needs of our communities, speci/fically those groups who are disproportionately a/ffected by rising living costs.\n\n## \u00a3400m\n\nInaugural Green bond issued under our Green Financing Framework (value as of March 2023), attracting capital to support the creation of green buildings, renewable energy and energy-e/fficiency projects.\n\n25\n\nO/ffice occupiers engaged to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption by 20-30%.\n\n## 33%\n\nReduction in energy intensity from 2013/14 baseline, so we remain on track to achieve a 45% reduction by 2030.\n\n## 55%\n\nReduction in operational carbon emissions (tCO2e) compared with 2013/14 baseline, on track to meet carbon-reduction target of 70% by 2030.\n\n## \u00a320m\n\nCommitted \u00a320m to enhance social mobility and create pathways for people from underrepresented backgrounds into our industry through Landsec Futures.\n\n## Net Zero by 2040\n\nUpdated our carbon-reduction targets to align with the Net-Zero Standard from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), committing to achieve net zero by 2040.\n\n## 36%\n\nReduction in upfront embodied carbon compared to traditional construction methods achieved at The Forge, SE1.

It will ensure we meet our near-term carbonreduction target and the proposed Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard (MEES) of EPC B by 2030.\n\nOur portfolio is now 100% compliant with the 2023 MEES EPC E or above requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, 36% of our portfolio, 38% of o/ffices and 34% of retail, are already meeting the proposed MEES of EPC B. With the sale of 1 New Street Square, which had an EPC B rating, the proportion of our portfolio meeting EPC B has reduced, however we are con/fident that as we continue with our NZTIP we will meet the proposed MEES.\n\nWe expect the plan to remove 24,000 tonnes of carbon emissions from Landsec's operations.\n\nWe are making excellent progress with our plan, spending over \u00a32m in 2022/23 on the following initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Moving to cleaner sources of energy, replacing gas-/fired boilers with air source heat pumps.\n- \u00b7 Optimising building management systems, ensuring they operate in accordance with the way buildings are occupied. We're testing predictive and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEPC data excludes spaces that are not required to have EPCs, spaces designated for development, spaces with registered EPC exemptions or spaces not covered by MEES regulations such as assets located in Scotland.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- self-adaptive AI technology to optimise heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems at our head o/ffice. We predict this will contribute to energy reductions of up to 10%.\n- \u00b7 Increasing the capacity of onsite renewable energy, installing solar panels at eight of our retail sites. This year we carried out six air source heat pump feasibility studies and seven renewable energy feasibility studies.\n- \u00b7 Replacing all /fluorescent lighting with LEDs.\n\n## Reducing emissions from our construction activities\n\nApproximately a third of carbon emissions from commercial buildings are produced before a building is even occupied1. For Landsec, 40% of our total emissions comes from capital goods which include our construction activities. We expect this proportion to increase as we decarbonise our buildings, the grid decarbonises, our development pipeline expands and our occupiers employ more sustainable working practices.\n\nTo address this, we've set ambitious targets to reduce emissions from our construction activities, targeting a 50% reduction in average upfront embodied carbon compared with a typical building by 2030. Achieving this target won't be easy and we know we're going to have to do things di/fferently - making changes throughout our supply chain to transform the way we design and develop buildings, ensuring we consider carbon from the outset of a scheme.\n\nWe're investing in low-carbon construction materials such as cross-laminated timber and Concretene, which we hope will build con/fidence in these products and pave the way for the industry to accelerate the transition to net zero. To further increase industry demand for low-carbon steel and concrete, we're signatory members of SteelZero and ConcreteZero.\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Build well continued\n\nUnderstanding that a substantial amount of material often sits below the ground in basements and structural foundations, our starting point is to consider repurposing existing buildings rather than demolishing and replacing them, to reduce the upfront embodied carbon of a scheme. If we conclude that a retention scheme would result in a signi/ficantly sub-optimal product for our customers or communities by limiting the public bene/fits we can provide, we will look into a replacement scheme that maintains a focus on positive environmental outcomes, for example, by reusing and upcycling demolition waste.\n\nThis year we completed The Forge, SE1, our /first net zero carbon o/ffice development to be constructed and operated in line with the UK Green Building Council's (UKGBC) framework de/finition of net zero carbon buildings.\n\nIn addition to its net zero credentials, The Forge has the following sustainability features:\n\n- \u00b7 Approximately 36% reduction in overall upfront embodied carbon compared to traditional construction methods.\n- \u00b7 It is an all-electric building that uses heat pumps to provide heating, cooling and hot water.\n- \u00b7 Powered by 100% renewable electricity.\n- \u00b7 5-star NABERS UK design-stage rating.\n- \u00b7 Roof top solar PV panels, green roof areas and rainwater harvesting - all contributing to an Excellent BREEAM rating.\n- \u00b7 18.4% reduction in primary steelworks compared to traditional steel frame.\n- \u00b7 13% less concrete compared with traditional benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 50% ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) content in substructure concrete and 40% GGBS content in Platform Design for Manufacture and Assembly (P-DfMA) /floor slabs.\n- \u00b7 All remaining upfront embodied carbon has been o/ffset using Gold Standard carbon credits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Taking a prudent approach to energy procurement\n\nLandsec has a /flexible-procurement framework in place to manage wholesale energy risk across our portfolio. The strategy is to spread risk as much as possible by forward-hedging three years in advance in six-month trading windows to minimise our exposure to market conditions, which is to be fully hedged by /financial year end. We review our usage across our assets every quarter to ensure we make accurate purchasing decisions that meet expected consumption. We have again procured 100% renewable electricity as part of our ongoing commitment to RE100; a global group of large companies that will use only 100% renewable power.\n\nWe continue to reduce our exposure to the wholesale markets by buying into longer-term, /fixed-rate renewable contracts. We will be aiming to introduce Corporate Power Purchasing Agreements into Landsec's fuel mix by 2025.\n\n## Updating our carbon-reduction targets, committing to net zero by 2040\n\nOur current science-based carbonreduction target is to reduce our operational carbon emissions by 70% by 2030, from a 2013/14 baseline year.\n\nIn October 2021, due to the scale and urgency of the climate emergency, the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) published the Net-Zero Standard, which provides the world's /first credible, independent assessment of corporate net zero targets. We've therefore increased our ambition this year in response to this standard, updating our science-based targets to cover emissions from all sources, including all of our reported scope 3 emissions such as emissions from our development pipeline, supply chain and customers. We have updated our baseline from 2013/14 to 2020 and have committed to reach net zero by 2040, ensuring we will meet the requirements set out by the SBTi.\n\n- -Overall net-zero target: We've committed to reaching net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across the value chain by 2040 from a 2020 base year.\n- -Near-term target: We've committed to reducing absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions 47% by 2030 from a 2020 base year.\n- -Long-term target: We've committed to reducing absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 90% by 2040 from a 2020 base year.\n\nTo achieve our near-term target, we must continue to execute our net zero transition investment plan (NZTIP) as detailed above. In addition, we must achieve our embodied-carbon target by 2030, to reduce average upfront embodied carbon by 50% compared with a typical building, aiming for 500 kgCO 2 e/m 2 for o/ffices and 400 kgCO 2 e/m 2 for residential.\n\nTo achieve our long-term target, we must continue to reduce carbon emissions from our operational and construction activities. This will require us to focus on: targeting suppliers with lower carbon impacts, investing in and demanding low-carbon construction materials, removing fossil fuels from our operations, investing in on-site renewable-electricity capacity, and working with occupiers to promote sustainable working practices.\n\n## Enhancing nature and green spaces\n\nNature plays an important role in the built environment - nature's capacity to store carbon and support resilient societies is linked with the /fight against climate change, and access to green spaces supports the health and wellbeing of those who use our places.\n\nWe will enhance nature and biodiversity across our portfolio, targeting a 25% biodiversity net gain across our operational sites that currently o/ffer the greatest potential, and e/ffectively targeting 15% biodiversity net gain at all of our new",

Across our retail sites we have replaced hedgerows with native species at White Rose, Leeds, planted trees as part of the Queen's Green Canopy at Gunwharf Quays, and introduced a bee hive with 35,000 honey bees at Lewisham Shopping Centre.\n\nThis year, we're investigating how our business activities depend on and a/ffect nature, so we can integrate nature into decision making across our operational and development activities. The work will consider the draft recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and build upon our current commitments, as well as provide biodiversity toolkits to support the whole business in considering how we can best enhance nature and biodiversity through our activities.\n\n## Using resources e/fficiently\n\n## Water\n\nOver the last year, we have undertaken water management assessments across assets under our operational control, to help shape our water strategy for both our o/ffice and retail portfolios.\n\nActions taken include a programme of work to install automatic meter reading (AMR) across our portfolio, testing technology to obtain increased detail of where water is consumed within our buildings and to identify potential leaks, and developing a water standard for the taps, toilets and showers we use across our facilities.\n\nTo raise awareness of the importance of saving water, on World Water Day in March 2023 we communicated our approach to water management and reduction across the business and encouraged our colleagues to take action. We are in the process of setting a new water target using 2022/23 as our baseline year, due to launch later this year.\n\n## Waste\n\nIn 2022/23 we continued to divert 100% of waste from land/fill and recycled 68% of operational waste (2021/22: 71%).\n\n## Materials\n\nTo use more sustainable materials and to use these resources e/fficiently, we encourage reuse and recycling where possible, promoting the principles of a circular economy. On our development schemes, we work closely with our supply chain, including carbon consultants in the design team from the very start to guide decisions on the most carbon-e/fficient solutions. Additionally, our Materials Brief sets out the requirements for common materials used across our schemes, considering health impacts, responsible sourcing, carbon and resource e/fficiency. We continue to source all our construction materials from ethical sources (materials with a responsible sourcing certi/fication).\n\n- We've used an innovative alternative to cement at May/field, Manchester - Concretene.\n\n## Using innovative materials at May/field\n\nProduction of cement for use in concrete creates approximately 8% of total global carbon emissions. At our May/field regeneration scheme, we've therefore tested Concretene, a pioneering lowcarbon material that has the potential to transform the global construction sector by providing an alternative to traditional cement. Concretene uses a product called graphene to signi/ficantly improve the mechanical performance of concrete, allowing for reductions in the amount of material used and the need for steel reinforcement. We were the /first developer to employ Concretene on a commercial scheme and have used it to create a 54x14m mezzanine /floor.",

Our site teams across the UK continue to work with community organisations to support people a/ffected by the cost-of-living crisis, providing support to some of the most vulnerable in society. This includes:\n\n- \u00b7  the White Rose team supporting the work of the Leeds South and Rethink Food Bank\n- \u00b7  creating warm spaces for vulnerable people at W12 Centre and the O2 Centre\n- \u00b7  introducing the CommUNITY Space at Lewisham Shopping Centre, providing a warm space for those who need it\n- \u00b7  providing promotional support for The Felix Project at Piccadilly Lights, while supporting their work at Lewisham Shopping Centre.\n\nOur new social-mobility fund, Landsec Futures, will enhance this work in our local communities, ensuring we have a long-term approach to investing in our communities over the next ten years.\n\nLaunching Landsec Futures: a fund\n\nto maximise the potential of people,\n\nplaces and communities\n\nIn May 2022, we announced our commitment to enhance social mobility in the real estate industry and the places where we invest, committing \u00a320m from 2023/24 - 2033/34. To achieve this, in April 2023 we launched Landsec Futures, which will provide support through industry and local programmes.\n\nThis commitment enables us to focus our approach to community investment on a clear purpose, which is to enhance social mobility in the real estate industry by creating pathways for people from under-represented backgrounds in our communities to enter careers in our sector.\n\nAdditionally, we recognise that the communities where we create, curate and sustain places all face a wide range of local issues, from fuel poverty to homelessness, and if these issues are not addressed, our places won't thrive. We're therefore also focused on tackling issues local to our assets and developments.\n\nWe will support people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who meet key metrics outlined by the UK Social Mobility Commission, in entering the real estate industry, and we will support charities that tackle issues local to our assets and developments.\n\n## Improving wellbeing\n\nCreating healthy buildings\n\nTo ensure we continue to maximise the wellbeing of those who occupy our buildings, in April 2023 we submitted evidence for WELL Portfolio certi/fication for four assets; 80-100 Victoria Street, Dashwood House, Zig Zag Building and One New Change.

It sets out a systematic approach for us to achieve sustainable development, culminating in a scheme-speci/fic sustainability strategy and social value strategy being developed.\n\nEnsuring every colleague takes responsibility for achieving our sustainability vision, we link a proportion of our remuneration to achieving our energy and carbon targets, and we ask 100% of our colleagues to set an annual objective demonstrating how they contribute to our sustainability commitments.\n\nThis year we also launched our Introduction to Sustainability training, to build sustainability capability and knowledge across our business. The course is mandatory for all colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Doing the basics brilliantly\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\n51% of our emissions emanate from our supply chain, therefore it is important we work with suppliers that share our values and help us achieve the highest standards in our supply chain, while achieving wider social, economic and environmental bene/fits. In June 2022, we published our Supply Chain Commitment, which sets out how we do business, the commitments we've set ourselves, and the minimum requirements we expect of all those we work with. 100% of our strategic partners align with our sustainability requirements and are working with us for a sustainable future, with 93% signing up to our commitment to date. Complementing our Supply Chain Commitment, we've also published our Sustainable Procurement Guide - a document that provides us with the knowledge to make the right decisions when buying consumables or business services, and to spend money wisely and e/ffectively while supporting our corporate and sustainability commitments.\n\nTo support our supply chain in meeting Our Supply Chain Commitments, we've joined the Supply Chain Sustainability School - an online platform that shares knowledge and resources to build the skills required to achieve a sustainable built environment.\n\n## Creating healthy, safe and secure spaces\n\nThis year we have maintained our ISO 45001 certi/fication, with independent auditors reporting no non-conformances or improvement recommendations. A full re-certi/fication audit to this standard will take place in FY23/24.\n\nWe continued to focus our safety improvements on areas where we know we could have the biggest impact, including reducing the risk of signi/ficant occupational-safety hazards, such as working at height, /fire safety, and working near electromagnetic /fields. We have also continued to work with other leading property companies to establish consistency in measuring and reporting health and safety data, to enable performance benchmarking with our peer group.\n\n## Fire safety\n\nWe continue to enhance /fire safety across the business, and ensure we meet new government initiatives and legislation. In 2022, we achieved certi/fication to BS 9997 for our /fire safety management system, which we have maintained this year. All high-rise residential buildings above 11 metres in our portfolio have been examined by independent /fire engineers to ensure they remain safe for occupation and meet stringent new building regulations, with design principles aligned with requirements of the Building Safety Act mandated on all future schemes. We have accepted responsibility under the Developers' Pledge to remediate at our expense any life-safety-critical defects in any building we developed or substantially renovated, going back 30 years. We will complete any remedial works as quickly as possible, with no cost and minimum disruption to tenants and local communities.",

We are calling for action from the government: to introduce a performancebased energy rating scheme; to mandate for whole-life carbon assessments for all new developments; and to lead by example by setting a standard for sustainable development through their procurement.\n\n## Identifying and responding to ESG risks and opportunities\n\nOur approach to sustainability is determined by shifting global challenges and the ESG issues our stakeholders think are most critical for us to address and in/fluence through our business activity. Our sustainability strategy, targets and activity, demonstrate how we are responding to these issues and where we know we can have the biggest impact. Our materiality matrix sets out our highpriority issues landsec.com/sustainability/ our-material-issues .\n\nAs the climate crisis becomes more of a reality, with increased severe weather, tightening legislation, and growing pressure from investors and occupiers - we've identi/fied climate change as a principal risk and, as such, govern and manage it in line with our risk management and control framework. This framework enables us to identify, assess and manage climaterelated risks e/ffectively - evaluating the potential impact, the consequences,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nallocation of risk owner, description of controls and control owners, and /finally providing an evaluation of any residual risks.\n\n- -You can /find more detail about our climate change risks and opportunities, our mitigation and adaptation strategy, and metrics and targets, in our TCFD Disclosure Statement on pages 47-53\n\nAdditionally, to comply with relevant environmental legislation and industry standards, we maintain a legal register as part of our environmental and energy management systems, which are certi/fied to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001. We review this register quarterly to ensure we consider new legislation or regulatory changes, and take any necessary action to maintain compliance.\n\n## Future plans\n\nWe have already made great progress with our sustainability targets, but with a new year comes a fresh opportunity to turn our vision and ambition into tangible action. We recognise there will be challenges in achieving these plans, and we don't have all the answers, but we believe that by being explicit in our targets we can incentivise and support action across our industry.\n\nKey to this will be our ongoing collaboration with our peers, customers and government to ensure we have a united approach that achieves the progress and outcomes required to create a greener, fairer society for all.\n\nOur priorities for the year ahead:\n\n- \u00b7 Continue to follow our NZTIP, moving our portfolio to net zero and meeting the impending Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standard of EPC B by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Continue to account for carbon at the outset of every development and refurbishment scheme, striving to meet our embodied-carbon targets by engaging early with our supply chain to secure sustainable construction materials, and encouraging our design teams and contractors to prioritise retention and reposition where possible.\n\n- \u00b7 Investigate innovative technologies, services and materials that will help us transition to net zero, and be prepared to try these products on our schemes.\n- \u00b7 Run Landsec Futures, working with our communities to better understand and meet their requirements alongside achieving greater diversity across our industry.\n- \u00b7 Continue to lobby government to ensure there is a supportive, stable policy environment that creates a greener, fairer society for all.",

Since then, we have reduced emissions, and achieved our original science-based target (SBT) in 2019, 11 years ahead of our 2030 target date. In 2019, we increased the ambition of our SBT in line with a 1.5\u00baC global warming scenario, which formed the foundation of our transition to net zero. Over the last year, we have updated our SBT and net zero commitment, which SBTi has now approved to be in line with their Net-Zero Standard. We have also committed to all new developments being net zero carbon both in construction and operation.\n\nIn 2017, we were one of the /first companies to report our approach to the recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and we introduced climate change as a principal risk in 2020. Over the last year, we have continued to evolve our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of climate change, by forming a Climate Transition Disclosure Working Group and aligning our statement with the recommendations of the UK Government's Transition Plan Taskforce.\n\nWe continue to progress our net zero transition investment plan and are on track with what we need to do to meet our science-based carbon reduction target, and have incorporated this into our /financial statements.\n\nThis statement is consistent with the requirements of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) Listing Rule 9.8.6 R and all 11 TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, and we can con/firm we have made climate-related /financial disclosures for the year ended 31 March 2023 in relation to governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board oversight and reporting\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing our approach to climate-related risks and opportunities a/ffecting the business, with our CEO having overall responsibility.\n\nThe Board receives reports on our sustainability and climate-related performance twice per calendar year, and this year has focused on the progress of our transition plans, embedding our new sustainability framework across the business and monitoring performance of our SBT and embodied-carbon commitments.\n\nAs we consider climate change a principal risk, the Board considers the impact of climate risks when discussing Landsec strategy and long-term success, including signi/ficant investment decisions.\n\n## Roles, responsibilities and accountability\n\nThe Audit Committee supports the Board in managing risk, and is responsible for reviewing our principal risk register, and the e/ffectiveness of our risk management and internal control processes.\n\nOngoing responsibility and management of climate-related risks is carried out by the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), chaired by our CEO and supported by our CFO and Managing Directors. The ELT is responsible for developing the sustainability strategy to ensure it addresses our relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and opportunities, including those pertaining to climate change. They discuss sustainability and climate risks quarterly, or more often if required.\n\nThe ELT is supported by the Sustainability Forum, which consists of senior representatives responsible for programmes of work that meet our sustainability targets, and for mitigating climate risks across our Workplace and Lifestyle business units. The Sustainability team, led by the Head of ESG and Sustainability, is responsible for co-ordinating the sustainability strategy and updating the climate risks, collaborating with all areas of the business to ensure appropriate mitigation and adaptation plans are in place. The Climate Transition Disclosure Working Group comprises members of the Sustainability team and representatives from our Strategy, Risk and Finance teams, to continue to evolve our approach to transition planning.\n\n- -We provide further information on our website showing our governance structure for managing climate risk: landsec.com/sustainability/ governance-policies",

Our culture comes from the values we share. These values guide the way we interact with others and help us make the right decisions.\n\nSustainability, which includes our focus on climate-related risks, has long been a strategic priority for Landsec and as such, is embedded within our culture. Every colleague is empowered to contribute to our purpose with consideration for the environmental, social and economic issues relevant to our business and stakeholders our Employee Code of Conduct provides guidance on how to do this and highlights key policies, including our Sustainability Policy that all colleagues must follow.\n\nTo hold colleagues accountable, every colleague is encouraged to set an annual objective demonstrating how they will contribute to achieving our sustainability vision and commitments. Achievement of this objective is assessed annually and forms part of our performance-related pay.\n\nOver the last year, we launched our Landsec Spotlight Awards to recognise individuals, projects and teams who demonstrate bringing our purpose to life, whereby celebrating our achievements is an important part of our culture.\n\nTo support our strategy and further establish sustainability throughout the business, we have created our Green Financing Framework, enabling us to issue green bonds. It describes the types of projects eligible, the process for selecting and allocating projects, management of proceeds and reporting in support of our climate transition aims. It has been third-party assured and aligns with the Green Bond Principles 2021 and Green Loans Principles 2021 administered by ICMA and LMA, respectively.\n\nThe framework can be accessed on our website: landsec.com/investorsdebtinvestors/green-bonds\n\n## Incentives and remuneration\n\nOur commitment to addressing climate risk runs throughout the business, with climate-related targets linked to a proportion of our bonus remuneration, including our science-based carbon reduction target, energy e/fficiency and embodied carbon from new developments.\n\n## Skills, competencies and training\n\nOver the last year, as we continue to mitigate the risks of climate change and transition our portfolio to net zero, we've focused on increasing Board and executive leadership level awareness and knowledge on our science-based carbon reduction targets and the actions that we need to take to meet them, including executing our net-zero transition investment plan (NZTIP) and our ambitious embodied carbon targets.\n\nFurther, we are ensuring everyone across our business undertakes sustainability training, which includes information on our sustainability strategy and approach to climate change - demonstrating how everyone can play a part in reducing our contribution to climate change and preparing for inevitable changes in climate. Additionally, we've joined the Supply Chain Sustainability School which provides an online platform to share knowledge and resources to build the skills required to deliver a sustainable built environment.\n\n## Strategy\n\n## Identifying climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nIn accordance with TCFD recommendations, we've identi/fied climate risks and opportunities against (1) transition risks: related to the transition to a low carbon economy and (2) physical risks: related to the physical impacts of climate change.\n\nWe've considered these over the short (<1 year), medium (until 2030) and long-term (beyond 2030) against two science-based scenarios - below 2\u00baC (aligned with Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) SSP1-2.6) and exceeding 4\u00baC (aligned with SSP5-8.5).\n\nWe summarise the output of our scenario analysis below, where we have used MSCI's Climate Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to assess our portfolio exposure to climate risks. Physical risks are assessed based on the geolocation of assets and their exposure to individual hazards as a consequence of climate change. Transitional risks are assessed based on alignment of assets to relevant regulations (e.g. Minimum Energy E/fficiency Standards (MEES)) and market demand.\n\n## Assessing impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our strategy\n\nBased on the risks identi/fied in our scenario analysis and following our group risk management framework and methodology, we have assessed these against likelihood (1 being very unlikely; 5 being very likely) and potential /financial impact (1 being insigni/ficant (< \u00a375m); 5 being very signi/ficant (> \u00a3500m)) across all areas of our business including investments, divestments, development and operations to determine both inherent risk (before mitigating actions) and residual risk (after mitigating actions).",

Conversely, transition risks are material in the short and medium term as we expect increasing mitigation actions to be taken to reduce emissions, such as policy and regulation changes, as well as changes in customer and investor preference.\n\nWe are addressing these risks and opportunities through three priorities, all of which are critical elements of our approach to sustainability - Build well, Live well, Act well:\n\n- \u00b7 Decarbonising our portfolio\n- \u00b7 Developing net zero carbon buildings\n- \u00b7 Building resilience to a changing climate\n\n## Decarbonising our portfolio\n\nIn an e/ffort to reduce our contribution to climate change, we need to reduce our operational carbon emissions from the assets that we own and manage. This year, we've increased the ambition of our carbon reduction target to align\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith the SBTi Net-Zero Standard and have continued to progress our \u00a3135m Net Zero Transition Investment Plan (NZTIP).\n\nThe Net-Zero Standard sets out a consistent de/finition of net zero and the science-based requirements of achieving it. To meet the standard, and demonstrate the business is moving towards net zero, we must set two reduction targets; a near-term target (5-10 years) and a long-term target (2050 at the latest). The near-term target must cover 95% of scope 1 and 2 emissions and 67% of scope 3 emissions. The long-term target must increase scope 3 coverage to 90%. Both targets must align with a 1.5\u00baC ambition level of limiting temperature rise.",

We also commit to reducing absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from all reported sources by 45% within the same timeframe.\n\n## Our long-term carbon reduction target\n\nWe commit to reaching net-zero GHG emissions across the value chain by 2040.\n\nWe commit to reducing absolute scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 90% by 2040, from a 2020 base year.\n\n## Income statement\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nResearch shows buildings that have high sustainability credentials attract higher average rents, improving leasing and occupancy rates. Improved energy e/fficiency should also improve service charges payable by tenants.\n\nConversely, older, less sustainable assets will ultimately see longer voids for retro/fits and a loss of rental income where they do not meet the minimum EPC requirements.\n\nF i n an c i al im p a c t\n\n## Developing net zero carbon buildings\n\nA credible net zero claim for a building must address both upfront embodied carbon and operational carbon, and align with industry best practice - currently this is the UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) framework de/finition of net zero. The framework requires embodied carbon to be minimised and o/ffset at practical completion, and reductions in energy demand and consumption to be prioritised over all other measures. There should be no reliance on fossil fuels and on-site renewables should be prioritised, and any remaining carbon should be o/ffset using a recognised o/ffsetting framework.\n\n## Our commitment to creating net zero carbon buildings\n\nWe are committed to designing and building net zero buildings in accordance with the UKGBC framework de/finition and have set a target to reduce upfront embodied carbon by 50% compared with a typical building by 2020, seeking to achieve <500kgCO 2 e/m 2 for o/ffice developments and <400kgCO 2 e/m 2 for residential ones.\n\nTo achieve our targets, we developed our \u00a3135m NZTIP. The focus of this is capital spending to electrify energy across the portfolio, improving the capital value of the a/ffected assets, which have shown more resilience to yield pressures than assets without a clear ESG strategy. The cost of our NZTIP will /fluctuate over the next seven years as we account for changes in in/flation.\n\nThe commitment forms a key part of our Sustainable Development Toolkit - a comprehensive guide for our development teams and external partners to ensure that sustainability is considered throughout the life-cycle of our schemes.\n\nWe engage carbon consultants on each of our developments. These become part of our design team from the very onset of the process. Alongside the guidance from our internal teams, their role is to guide decision making towards the most carbon-e/fficient solution, balancing upfront carbon with whole-life carbon, to ensure our design decisions do not a/ffect the longer-term carbon impacts of our assets negatively.\n\nAll whole-life carbon models align with the RICS guidance Whole life carbon assessment for the built environment /first edition, November 2017.\n\nTo reduce upfront embodied carbon, we look at a number of di/fferent interventions:\n\n- \u00b7 Structural retention and material reuse to avoid using virgin material.\n- \u00b7 Building as lean as possible to use less material and put less pressure on the foundations beneath the building.\n- \u00b7 Using low-carbon materials like timber or concrete with high cement replacement.\n- \u00b7 Prioritising local procurement to minimise transport emissions.\n\nWe track embodied carbon throughout the design evolution of a building and during construction, and we receive twice-yearly updates to the model based on actual material quantities brought to site and emissions from site. At the end of a project, we receive an 'as-built' model, which represents the actual upfront carbon emissions of the project. We then purchase high-quality carbon o/ffsets that comply with the UKGBC's eight principles of o/ffsetting.\n\n- -We provide further details on the progress of our NZTIP on page 41\n\nWe continue to operate our buildings in accordance with our Company-wide environmental and energy management system, which is certi/fied to ISO 14001 and ISO 50001, having energy-reduction plans (ERPs) and action plans for all our assets, which outline how we will reduce the energy use and carbon emissions of each asset e/ffectively. The ERPs form part of the operational /financial planning for each asset.\n\nAs we continue to build relationships with our suppliers, the climate-related information they provide (such as carbon emissions, energy consumption and relevant climate-related targets) allows us to better understand their operations and prioritise future engagement activity.\n\nTo meet our near-term science-based target and stay ahead of impending 2030 MEES requirements of minimum EPC B, we've continued to progress our \u00a3135m NZTIP:\n\n- \u00b7 Optimising building management systems across our portfolio, deploying innovative technologies such as arti/ficial intelligence to reduce operational energy consumption.\n- \u00b7 Reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, replacing gas-/fired boilers with electric systems such as air source heat pumps (ASHP).\n- \u00b7 Increasing on-site renewable electricity generation by installing solar panels across our retail assets.\n- \u00b7 Engaging and collaborating with our customers on energy e/fficiency to reduce consumption within their spaces.",

The performance of our facades and fabric materials is designed to address the expected higher temperatures by minimising energy demand, as well as to be able to withstand extreme temperatures and increased wind speeds, to avoid maintenance issues or damage to buildings in future. We target operational energy intensities in line with industry net zero carbon benchmarks, wherever available. Our drainage strategies are designed to mitigate foreseen rain levels and /flood risks using physical and nature-based solutions.\n\nIncreased demand for low-carbon materials, many of which are still nascent markets, could increase the construction costs of our development pipeline.\n\nAcross our operational portfolio, assets in areas highly exposed to physical risks have developed plans to ensure that adequate protection and mitigation are in place, including business-continuity and emergency-response plans.\n\nOur Responsible Property Investment Policy details how we assess climate risks during the sale and acquisition of assets. We conduct thorough due diligence, understanding the asset's performance metrics including energy consumption, EPCs and other sustainability credentials, assessing /flood risk and embodied carbon, and work with MSCI to use their Climate Risk Due Diligence Analysis platform for acquisitions.",

This framework enables us to identify, evaluate and manage our principal and emerging risks e/ffectively. Our approach is not to eliminate risk, but to manage it within our appetite. Key elements of the framework are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has overall responsibility for overseeing risk and for maintaining a robust risk management and internal control system.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the e/ffectiveness of the risk management and internal control system during the year.\n- \u00b7 The Executive Leadership Team is responsible for day-to-day monitoring and management of Group-wide risks, emerging risks and key risk indicators (KRIs).\n- \u00b7 Business area leadership teams monitor and manage risks and emerging risks relevant to their business areas.\n- \u00b7 The Risk and Assurance function oversees the framework, providing support, challenge and insight to business areas and support functions.\n- \u00b7 The Group Insurance team sits within the overall Risk and Assurance function, enabling collaboration between Insurance and Risk teams and detailed consideration of risk treatment planning, residual risk and transference to the insurance market, where appropriate.\n\n## Identifying and evaluating risks\n\nAs part of annual business planning, the Board undertakes an assessment of the risks that would threaten the Group's strategic objectives, future performance, solvency or liquidity. We use scenario modelling to better understand the impact of these risks on our business model when placed under varying degrees of stress, enabling us to consider interdependencies and test plausible mitigation plans. Senior management and teams across the business identify the strategic, operational, and legal and compliance risks, facing each area of our business. Risks are reviewed in detail with their respective owners, typically an ELT member or key business leader.\n\nWe use a risk scoring matrix to consider the likelihood and impact of each risk at regular points throughout the year. We evaluate risks on an inherent (before mitigating actions) and residual (after mitigating actions and controls) basis. From this, we identify principal risks (current risks with relatively high impact and certainty) and emerging risks (risks where the extent and implications are not yet fully understood).\n\nThese are included on our Group Risk Register, which the Executive Leadership Team challenges and validates. The Audit Committee reviews our principal risks before presenting them to the Board.",

Risk appetite is a forward-looking view, and is informed by Landsec's current and future risk management philosophy. Comparing the residual score to appetite helps to determine how risks or opportunities are managed. To embed risk appetite e/ffectively in the business we have established key risk indicators associated with each risk, de/fining limits that are aligned to our appetite. Scenario planning assists in setting these thresholds.\n\n## Management and assurance of risks\n\nDay-to-day ownership and management of key risks is assigned to members of the Executive Leadership Team. They are responsible for ensuring the e/ffectiveness of controls and for implementing risk mitigation plans, where necessary. Business area leadership teams review their risks quarterly and the ELT reviews the Group\n\n- -See page 88 for more information in the Report of the Audit Committee\n\nIn addition, the Risk and Assurance team manages Landsec's Key Controls Toolkit. The Toolkit is a set of clearly de/fined controls that are self-certi/fied by control owners within the business on a quarterly basis, providing ongoing assurance and coverage of key risk areas. The Audit Committee monitors the results of this process. The Audit Committee also reviews our risk management framework at least twice a year as well as our Assurance Map, which sets out the key controls and assurance activities for each risk. This supports the Committee's evaluation of the control environment and the adequacy of assurance activity. The Committee also receives a summary report at each meeting, describing key second and third-line assurance activities, including internal audits, actions agreed and the status of open risk mitigation actions.\n\nRisk Register bi-annually. The Board reviews principal and emerging risks bi-annually, with principal risks presented for review at each Audit Committee meeting.\n\nThe principal operational risks, including health and safety, and information security and cyber threat are managed by dedicated second-line functions that de/fine and implement policy and mitigating controls, and undertake assurance activities. Risk deep-dives are completed throughout the year for speci/fic risks, evaluating the current risk level and risk appetite, and agreeing any further actions.\n\nLandsec has an Internal Audit function that provides independent assurance over key controls and processes to management and the Audit Committee. We identify where the impact of controls is greatest i.e. where there is a relatively high inherent risk and relatively low residual risk, and this helps to focus the work of Internal Audit and other assurance providers.\n\n## Risk management framework\n\n<!-- image -->",

The yellow arrows indicate the inherent risk score before mitigating controls and blue arrows show residual risk scores after taking account of controls, as determined at year end.\n\nOur appetite range for each risk is re/flected by the white box. The lower down the column the box is, the lower our appetite. The appetite range is a future looking view as opposed to risk scores, which are stated as at the year end. For risks that have been mitigated to within our appetite, the blue residual arrow is within the box. The appetite for each risk, when compared to the residual score, helps to determine business priorities and mitigation activities in the future.\n\nAppetite ranges are: 'Open' (where we are focused on maximising opportunities); 'Flexible' (willing to consider all options); 'Cautious' (where we are willing to tolerate a degree of risk); 'Minimalist' (preferring options with low inherent risk); and 'Averse' (where we avoid risk and uncertainty). Risk appetite is a continuum and the range for some risks extend over more than one of these categories.\n\nAt present, there are no residual risk scores above appetite, though some are below, indicating an opportunity for greater risk to be taken in delivering business activities. The tables on the following pages describe each principal risk in detail, including mitigating controls, KRIs and changes in the year.",

Generally, the budget has a greater level of certainty and is used to set near-term targets across the Group. The strategic plan is less certain than the budget, but provides a longer-term outlook against which strategic decisions can be made.\n\nThe /financial planning process considers the Group's pro/fitability, capital values, gearing, cash /flows and other key /financial metrics over the plan period. These metrics are subject to sensitivity analysis, in which a number of the main underlying assumptions are /flexed and tested to consider alternative macroeconomic environments. Additionally, the Group also considers the impact of potential structural changes to the business in light of varying\n\neconomic conditions, such as signi/ficant additional sales and acquisitions or re/financing. These assumptions are then adapted further to assess the impact of considerably worse macroeconomic conditions than are currently expected, which forms the basis of the Group's 'Viability scenario'.\n\nGiven the recent unfavourable macroeconomic conditions in which the Group has been operating, additional stresstesting has been carried out on the Group's ability to continue in operation under extremely unfavourable operating conditions. While the assumptions we have applied in these scenarios are possible, they do not represent our view of the likely outturn. The Directors have also considered reverse stress-test scenarios including one in which we are unable to collect any rent for an extended period of time. The results of these tests help to inform the Directors' assessment of the viability of the Group.",

We concluded that as we have fully costed and committed to invest \u00a3135m to achieve our science-based net zero target by 2030, this mitigated the climate change transition risk su/fficiently.\n\n## Impact on key metrics\n\nWe have assessed the impact of these assumptions on the Group's key /financial metrics over the assessment period, including pro/fitability, net debt, loan-to-value ratios and available /financial headroom.\n\nThe viability scenario represents a contraction in the size of the business over the /five-year period considered, with the Security Group LTV at 48.0% in March 2028, its highest point in the assessment period. The Group maintains a positive /financial headroom from March 2023 through to March 2025. From March 2026 the Group will be required to secure new funding as existing facilities expire. This drives the negative available /financial headroom in the viability scenario at March 2028. The Directors expect the Group to be able to secure new funding, or exercise extension options, given the Group's expected loan-to-value ratio, the /flexibility of the /financing structure in place, and positive engagement with providers of funds to date.\n\n| Key Metrics                         | Actuals 31 March 2023   | Table 30 Viability  scenario 31 March 2028   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Security Group LTV                  | 33%                     | 48.0%                                        |\n| Adjusted net debt                   | \u00a33,287m                 | \u00a33,742m                                      |\n| EPRA Net Tangible  Assets per share | 936p                    | 638p                                         |\n| Available /financial  headroom      | \u00a32.4bn                  | (\u00a31.6bn)                                     |\n\n## Con/firmation of viability\n\nBased on this assessment the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to March 2028.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat could impact its ability to remain in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due and how we have taken these into consideration when making our assessment of the Group's viability.",

It aims to set a common language and clear de/finition to help companies, investors and policymakers understand whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable.\n\nThe EU taxonomy is a classi/fication system, establishing a list of sustainable economic activities that substantially contribute to the EU's six environmental objectives:\n\n- 1. Climate change mitigation\n- 2. Climate change adaptation\n- 3. The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources\n- 4. The transition to a circular economy\n- 5. Pollution prevention and control\n- 6. The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems\n\nTo date, details for only the /first two environmental objectives were released: climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nAs a UK company, Landsec is not in scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. However, we recognise the importance of providing our investors and stakeholders with information about the sustainability of our activities and portfolio of assets. For that\n\nreason, we have started working towards voluntarily disclosing information that can help investors to assess the alignment of our activities with the EU taxonomy.\n\nThe UK has established a Green Technical Advisory Group who have issued its initial recommendations to the UK Government on UK Green Taxonomy, which builds on the EU taxonomy and net zero in the UK context. Taking steps to understand the requirements from the EU taxonomy, helps us to prepare Landsec for the incoming implementation of the UK Green Taxonomy.\n\nIn the Build well section on pages 41-43, we provide information on how we are investing across our portfolio to transition to net zero, its current EPC ratings, and approach to new developments.\n\nWe provide further information on our portfolio EPC ratings and building certi/fications in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report.\n\nThis Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 15 May 2023 and signed on its behalf by:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Allan Chief Executive",

As a result, we appointed Miles Roberts and Sir Ian Cheshire.\n\nWe remain committed to having a Board that is diverse in all respects. As at the date of this report and throughout this /financial year we have complied with the Listing Rules requirements relating to diversity: (i) at least 40% of the Board are women (also meeting the FTSE Women Leaders target); (ii) at least one of the senior board positions are women (both Chair and CFO); and (iii) at least one individual on the Board is from a minority ethnic background (also meeting the Parker Review target). The Board and new Chair are aware that on my retirement our gender diversity will dip below 40%, and this will be taken into account in our near-term succession planning.\n\nImportantly, across the wider business, we have refreshed our diversity and inclusion strategy during the year and agreed new targets (see pages 35-38).\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nLandsec's success is dependent on the Board taking decisions for the bene/fit of our shareholders and in doing so having regard to all our stakeholders. Throughout the year, the Board received institutional investor updates and our Committee Chairs and Senior Independent Director have made themselves available to investors for meetings.\n\nOur 2022 AGM was held at our headquarters in London and shareholders were able to submit questions in advance for consideration by the Board.\n\nThis year we continued with our workforce engagement activities, including receiving a full brie/fing on the annual employee engagement survey results and Directors meeting directly with employees. Christophe Evain also engaged with our Employee Forum to answer questions on executive remuneration. The Board is\n\ncommitted to understanding the views of all of Landsec's stakeholders to inform the decisions that we make.\n\n## Culture\n\nThe Board understands the importance of culture and setting the tone of the organisation from the top and embedding it throughout Landsec. Our culture is a key component for continuing to make progress with our strategic plans. The aim of our people strategy is to create a highperforming and inclusive culture. During the year the Board monitored our culture with regular updates on our people, our organisational transformation programme, our culture, talent, diversity and inclusion activities and engagement survey, and direct engagement with the workforce.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nThis year our Board evaluation was carried out internally. The Board was satis/fied with its own performance, with all Board members rating performance as good or excellent. The composition of the Board was considered appropriate with the impact of recent changes noted.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nI would like to conclude by thanking members of the Board for their continued support and commitment over the past year and throughout my time as Chairman.

The Board also received a brie/fing and site visit of the n2 development on the same day.\n\nIn February 2023, the Board held its strategy away day at our Myo o/ffices at Dashwood House in London with a tour of 21 Moor/fields, a complex development nearing completion that showcased Landsec's deep development expertise during the life of the project.\n\nFinally, the Board were also provided with a market disclosure brie/fing to reinforce their knowledge of the Market Abuse Regulation including recent developments and case studies.\n\n| Board diversity 1                                              | Number  of Board members 2   | Percentage of the Board 2   | Number of  senior  positions on  the Board  (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair) 2   | Number in  Executive  Leadership  Team 3   | Table 33 Percentage  of Executive  Leadership  Team 3   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gender diversity                                               |                              |                             |                                                                           |                                            |                                                         |\n| Men                                                            | 6                            | 60%                         | 2                                                                         | 6                                          | 67%                                                     |\n| Women                                                          | 4                            | 40%                         | 2                                                                         | 3                                          | 33%                                                     |\n| Not speci/fied/prefer not to say                               | -                            | -                           | -                                                                         | -                                          | -                                                       |\n| Ethnic diversity                                               |                              |                             |                                                                           |                                            |                                                         |\n| White British or other White (including minority-white groups) | 9                            | 90%                         | 4                                                                         | 9                                          | 100%                                                    |\n| Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups                                   | -                            | -                           | -                                                                         | -                                          | -                                                       |\n| Asian/Asian British                                            | 1                            | 10%                         | -                                                                         | -                                          | -                                                       |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                          | -                            | -                           | -                                                                         | -                                          | -                                                       |\n| Other ethnic group, including Arab                             | -                            | -                           | -                                                                         | -                                          | -                                                       |\n| Not speci/fied/prefer not to say                               | -                            | -                           | -                                                                         | -                                          | -                                                       |\n\n- 1.

These opportunities allow the Board to develop and solidify relationships and further discuss matters impacting the business in an informal manner without the inevitable time restrictions of Board and Committee meetings.\n\nThe Non-executive Directors also met without the Executive Directors being present.\n\n## Execution of strategy\n\nThis year, the Board has continued to consider the Group's strategy and the execution of strategy, particularly in the context of the uncertain macroeconomic and political environments. In addition, the alignment of culture and the internal governance framework and strategy has been a focus of the Board. All of Landsec's stakeholder interests remain at the heart of strategy decisions especially in uncertain climates.\n\n-There is further information about the Board and our stakeholders on pages 76-79 and the Board and our Culture on pages 80-81\n\nThe Board considered a number of strategic areas during the year, which included reviews of the retail strategy, the residential strategy and the alignment with urban mixed-use. In addition, the Board considered the future of the o/ffice and /flex o/ffice. More details on the strategic (and other matters) considered by the Board can be found on page 75. As part of these strategic reviews the Board had a tour and deep dive review of our developments in the Southwark area of London.\n\nIn addition, the Board bene/fited from a session with some of the sustainability team on embodied carbon followed by a tour of the n2 development site, which brought to life some of the matters that had been discussed in the session.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe June meeting of the Board took place in Southwark and allowed the Board to bene/fit from a walking tour of the area led by the Executive Directors and members of the Central London o/ffice team.\n\nThe Board were initially given a presentation on why the Southbank was considered an important area and how in particular the Southwark area /fitted into this growing part of London.\n\nDuring the tour the Board were able to see our four existing (or potential) development sites in the area Timber Square, The Forge, Liberty of Southwark and Red Lion Court, and the thriving neighbourhoods in which they are located.\n\nThe tour allowed the Board to ask questions on the area, its heritage, development progress, and sustainability credentials. The Board welcomed the additional insight into the developments, the location and the impact on Landsec's growth strategy.",

This requires that Directors promote the success of the Company for the bene/fit of the members, having regard to the interest of stakeholders in their decision making. Over the next few pages, we provide examples of how the Board engages with stakeholders and takes into account their interests when making decisions.\n\n- -An introduction to our stakeholders can be found in our Strategic Report on page 11\n\n## Stakeholders and Board decision making\n\nOur stakeholders' interests and priorities continue to change, and a/ffect the way we work, shop and engage with each other. E/ffective communication with our stakeholders is critical to keeping pace with their evolving needs, which is so important for our long-term success. The Board's engagement with stakeholders is both direct and by management reporting up to the Board on stakeholder engagement, the importance of which is embedded\n\nthroughout our business.\n\n## Our customers\n\nWe have made good progress with growing our customer relationships which has been a key feature of our strategy for two years. The Board receives regular updates on our customers.\n\nDuring the year, the Board received a detailed brie/fing on our retail, o/ffice and mixed-use strategies including customer insights, as well as regular updates on customers as part of the business update at every meeting. This has helped to understand the changing requirements of o/ffice customers since the pandemic, including changing space requirements and the increased demand for 'healthy buildings'. As a business we have listened to o/ffice occupiers regarding their needs, resulting in us providing greater /flexibility of o/ffice leases.\n\nThe Board reviewed the retail strategy update in September. The Reimagine Retail change programme has been implemented and is based on three main strategies: the future asset, brand partners and guest experience. We have developed clear plans for each of our assets to make sure they deliver the physical experience, which continues to attract the right visitors for brands.\n\nEach location will see a more distinct identity, more closely representing the narrative of the area in which it is located, although there are some key themes that reach across all locations. The Board noted the good progress that had been made in recognising and understanding consumer behaviour and its impact on investment decisions, the importance of improving data insights and direct relationship management, but also ensuring that downside scenarios were considered.\n\nThe Board also received a residential strategy update from the Chief Strategy and Investment O/fficer and Head of Lifestyle Investment. The Board supported the view that residential should be part of our strategy.\n\ns\n\nder\n\nl\n\neho\n\nk\n\na\n\nt\n\ny s\n\ne\n\ne k\n\nv\n\nr /fi\n\nu\n\nO\n\nCustomers\n\nCommunities\n\nPartners\n\nEmployees\n\nInvestors",

The Board received a presentation on the Southwark area which highlighted the rich culture and heritage of this community, along with the good transport links, young population and amenities.\n\nThe assets owned by Landsec in the area were highlighted, including Red Lion Court, the Forge, the Liberty of Southwark and Timber Square. This was then followed by a walking tour of the area. Our Capital Markets Day event in September also focused on Southwark and provided investors with an operational update and tour of the area.\n\nThe Board visited the n2 development in December to see /first hand one of our sites under construction.\n\nThe Board had a tour of 21 Moor/fields as part of their strategy day in February which was held at our Myo /flexible o/ffice space in Dashwood House. The Board were impressed with the engineering challenges overcome at 21 Moor/fields and thought the business should be proud of their achievement with this complex development.\n\n- -You can read more about our community support on page 44\n\n## Our partners\n\nThe Board received updates during the year on /fire safety. The political and legislative landscape had evolved since the last review, including the introduction of the Developers' Pledge that required developers to rectify or fund remediation of critical /fire safety works in certain circumstances. Landsec committed to the pledge in July 2022 and signed the associated contract in March 2023.\n\nThe Board were updated by our Managing Director of Corporate A/ffairs during the year on local and national Government issues impacting the business. The Board also discussed the output of Landsec's local and national Government engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne New\n\nStreet Square\n\nIn January 2023 the Board approved the sale of One New Street Square, EC4 to Chinachem Group, a property developer based in Hong Kong.\n\nThe total consideration for the sale amounts to \u00a3349.5m. The sale price compares to a September 2022 valuation of \u00a3362.8m and crystallises a total return on capital averaging 10% per annum since Landsec's acquisition of the site in June 2005 and subsequent redevelopment in 2016.\n\nOne New Street Square is fully let to Deloitte, with a 14-year unexpired lease term remaining and a current annual net rent of \u00a316.8m. With limited opportunities to add further value, the disposal was in line with Landsec's strategy to recycle capital out of mature London o/ffices.\n\nThe Board considered the sale to be in line with the strategic review conducted in late 2020, when Landsec announced its intention to sell c.\u00a32.5bn of mature London o/ffices over the medium term. With the inclusion of One New Street Square, the Company has now sold \u00a32.1bn of o/ffices, representing an average yield of 4.4%.\n\nThe disposal proceeds will initially be used to repay debt and, on a pro-forma basis, would reduce Landsec's long-term value from 31.1% to 28.9% based on September 2022 valuations. Its strong balance sheet provides Landsec with signi/ficant optionality for future reinvestment in higher-return opportunities which are expected to emerge as markets continue to adjust to a new reality.",

The Employee Forum will then report back to constituents on topics throughout the year.\n\nChristophe Evain met with the Employee Forum separately to answer questions on executive remuneration.\n\nWe continued with our employee engagement sessions with two Nonexecutive Directors meeting a small group of employees from the Lifestyle area of the business. A range of matters were discussed including culture change, communications and business strategy. Manjiry Tamhane also joined a session of our Women's Network. The feedback from those sessions is passed back into the boardroom.\n\nThe Board also received a full brie/fing on the employee engagement survey which was undertaken in Summer 2022 which also gave them a good insight into employee sentiment. Read more about our engagement survey results on page 34.\n\nDuring the year there have been a number of drop in lunches held with members of our Executive Leadership Team, including our CEO and CFO.\n\nWe are also planning to hold another 'Meet the NEDs' event for employees immediately after our Annual General Meeting in July and further engagement events with smaller groups of employees from the other areas of our business in September and December. This will be a great opportunity for the Board to engage further with employees.\n\n## Themes raised at the employee engagement events included\n\n- the cost of living\n- the reorganisation and changes to the internal operating model\n- o/ffice environment and culture\n- retention of talent\n- diversity and inclusion\n- managing change\n- change communications\n- employee wellbeing and bene/fits\n\n## Feedback from employee engagement events\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'We met with Christophe on behalf of the Employee Forum to discuss Executive Remuneration and raise queries on behalf of the business. It was really great to meet Christophe and we really valued the open discussions we had with him. We were given a clear insight into Board life and dealing with shareholders, he elaborated on his role and discussed the recent recruitment process for our new Chairman which was really interesting.'\n\n'I thoroughly enjoy the monthly ELT lunch sessions, they are great opportunities to have conversations and build relationships with our leadership team. To me, it shows how committed our Executive team are to listen to and engage with colleagues across the business.'\n\n'I was lucky enough to meet Sir Ian Cheshire to discuss the Employee Forum's role and how it represents Landsec employees. We had a really open and wide-ranging conversation where Ian wanted to hear all about Landsec, the culture and what employees really cared about. We discussed the cost of living crisis, our focus on improving diversity and employee satisfaction drivers in a post-covid world - all issues that Ian is clearly engaged with and keen to help drive forward. We look forward to working with him and the wider Board more closely to make Landsec the best possible place to work.'\n\n- U&I integration\n- business strategy\n- career development",

Whilst some investor meetings were conducted online for the sake of convenience, the vast majority of our investor engagement has been face-to-face.\n\nIn September 2022, we held a Capital Markets Day in Southwark in London for institutional investors. This event provided an overview of the Southwark region and detail on the existing and potential development schemes Landsec has in this area of London. In addition, we explained our plans to reduce the embodied carbon within our developments through a combination of e/fficient use of materials, design and construction methods. The event also included a tour of Southwark to view our four major committed/potential development sites.\n\nWe engaged with investors throughout the year on all aspects of environmental, social and governance matters. In February 2023, we conducted a sustainability roadshow in the Netherlands, meeting with fund managers and sustainability analysts from major institutional investors.\n\n## Industry conferences\n\nIndustry conferences provide Executive Directors with a chance to meet a large number of investors on a formal and informal basis. Conferences attended this year included the UBS Global Property conference in London, the Kempen conference in Amsterdam, the Bank of America conference in New York, the Citi conference in Florida, Barclays' real estate conference in London and Morgan Stanley's real estate conference in London.

This year we have made signi/ficant progress on a journey that had already commenced, but which has now been considered in detail by the Board and is being embedded throughout the Group. The key components of that journey are outlined here.\n\nIn order to ensure that our growth strategy was not hindered by legacy ways of working, a cultural change programme was initiated during the year which resulted in a change to the operating model and a new internal governance framework led by the Board and supported by the Executive Leadership Team.\n\n- -More detail on this revised framework can be found on pages 69-70\n\nEmbedding cultural change through a new operating model\n\nThe new operating model and governance structure ultimately /flows up to the Board and is designed to facilitate and encourage clear reporting, decision making, empowerment, accountability, employee input and stakeholder feedback, and enable a focus on our customers, leading to growth.\n\nThe Board have been regularly updated and inputted as this programme has evolved and are now supporting management in embedding this across the organisation through organisational design, business planning, leadership e/ffectiveness and behaviours, reward and incentivisation and diversity and inclusion. More details on each of these areas are set out on the opposite page.\n\nIn shaping this framework, feedback from an externally facilitated employee engagement survey undertaken during the year was also taken into account. The Board were appraised of the key themes arising from the survey and challenged management as to how they address the areas where the need for improvement was identi/fied. Positive changes are already underway and employee engagement surveys will be undertaken on a regular basis, which will assist in allowing the Board to assess progress.\n\nIn addition, as the Board have greatly bene/fited from /first hand engagement with employees at Non-executive Director engagement sessions, similar meetings are continuing and a further series is planned throughout the coming year.\n\n- -Further information on employee engagement can be found on page 34\n\nMetrics which are provided to the Board to allow them to consider certain cultural themes are shown on the next page.",

Sir Ian joined the Board at the end of March and will succeed me as Chair on 16 May. On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to be welcoming someone of Sir Ian Cheshire's calibre as Chair.\n\nWe also appointed Miles Roberts as Non-executive Director in September 2022. Miles, who originally trained as a structural engineer, brings signi/ficant experience as a serving chief executive and has held a number of non-executive roles. You can read about the Committee's appointment process for both Sir Ian and Miles on page 84.\n\nColette O'Shea stepped down from the Board in September and as Chief Operating O/fficer in March. Colette joined Landsec in 2003 and was appointed to the Board in 2018. The Committee is extremely grateful to Colette for her signi/ficant contribution to the Board and the business during her time at Landsec.\n\n## Board evolution\n\nA balanced and diverse Board with a mix of skills, expertise, background and tenure is critical to the success of the Company. The composition of the Board underpins the quality of debate and challenge during discussions.\n\nThe process for Board appointments is led by the Nomination Committee which makes recommendations to the Board for its approval. It is the Nomination Committee's responsibility to keep Board composition under review, including reviewing director independence and tenure. During the year the Committee reviewed the composition and skills of the Board, and developed an ongoing plan for Board succession, taking into account recent and likely future Board changes.\n\nThe Board is mindful that Edward Bonham Carter has been a Director in excess of nine years and so the Committee reviewed his independence and role and was completely satis/fied that Edward continues to bring independent judgement to the Board. As such, the Nomination Committee was satis/fied that Edward can continue to ful/fill the role of Senior Independent Director.\n\nThe Committee also has responsibility for oversight of Executive Leadership Team and senior management succession. This is also discussed by the Board as a whole, with a focus on diversity and inclusion and developing and maintaining the internal talent pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We promote diversity in the broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also experience, skills, professional background and tenure. The Nomination Committee monitors our talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse pool of talent being developed at all levels of the business. Maintaining a diverse workforce is as important as diverse recruitment and we continue to assess and promote this. During the year, we have refreshed the overall diversity and inclusion strategy for the Group, including setting new targets.\n\nI am pleased to report that during this /financial year we met the Listing Rule requirements targets for diversity. 40% of our Board members are women, our Chair and CFO positions have been held by women, and we have one member of the Board from an ethnic minority background. The Committee is aware that as a result of the change of Chair in May 2023, the Board's gender diversity will dip below 40%, and this will be taken into consideration in Board composition and succession planning.\n\nI am pleased to report that following the recruitment of Marina Thomas as Head of Governance and Company Secretary and Kate Seller as Chief People O/fficer during the year, one third of the Executive Leadership Team are women (which will increase to 40% when our new Chief Data & Technology O/fficer joins us in June 2023). We acknowledge that ongoing work is needed to increase diversity of our Executive Leadership Team and its direct reports whilst ensuring that appointments and succession plans are based on merit and objective criteria and the Committee, and the Board will continue to monitor progress.\n\n- -You can read more about diversity and inclusion at Landsec in our People and Culture section on pages 35-38\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Internal Board evaluation\n\nThis year our Board evaluation was carried out internally with the Committee's e/ffectiveness assessed as part of the internal review. The Committee was satis/fied with its own e/ffectiveness as a whole and pleased with the outcome of the Non-executive succession planning and processes, including the Chair selection process, which had been a main focus during the year. With a new Chair and Executive Leadership Team in place it is appropriate to reset the Committee's priorities to focus more on wider Board succession, while continuing to cover all areas of the Committee's remit including ongoing management succession planning.\n\n- -Further details on the internal Board evaluation can be found on pages 86-87\n\n## Corporate governance\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has overseen the corporate governance agenda on behalf of the Board. I am pleased to con/firm that Landsec has complied with and applied all of the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code for the /financial year ended 31 March 2023.

Hedley May, an independent executive search /firm and with no connection to Landsec, was appointed to conduct the search for a Chairman with experience in retail and customer-focused businesses. A diverse shortlist of candidates was put forward by Hedley May and the candidates met with members of the Chairman Succession Committee and the CEO, CFO and the other Non-executive Directors. The Chairman Succession Committee concluded that Sir Ian Cheshire would be an excellent addition to the Board bringing a wealth of experience across customerfocused businesses in executive and non-executive positions in listed companies.\n\nIn 2022, the Nomination Committee appointed Russell Reynolds, an independent executive search /firm with no connection to Landsec to conduct a search for a Non-executive Director. Members of the Committee and the CEO met with a shortlist of candidates put forward by Russell Reynolds. The Committee concluded that Miles Roberts with his experience as a serving chief executive and in non-executive roles would be a positive addition to the Board.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe Board's policy on diversity establishes the importance of diversity in the broadest sense, not just gender or ethnicity but also experience, skills, professional background, tenure and also other di/fferentials between\n\ndirectors such as cognitive and personal strengths. The Board believes that diversity is crucial to creating a high-performing, e/ffective Board, to provide a breadth of perspective and debate that aids decision making and which supports and directs the business more e/ffectively.\n\nThe Nomination Committee works with executive search consultants to ensure they support our approach to diversity in providing a diverse selection of candidates for Board appointments and the selection can then be based upon merit and objective criteria.\n\nDiversity at Board level sets the tone for diversity throughout the business. The Nomination Committee monitors our talent pipeline to ensure we have a diverse succession pool of talent being developed and maintained at all levels of the business. Maintaining a diverse workforce is as important as diverse recruitment and we continue to assess this.\n\nDiversity is also addressed at the Remuneration Committee, particularly in the context of gender pay gap, and discussed at the main Board in light of its increased focus on the promotion and maintenance of diversity at all levels of talent throughout our business.\n\n-Further information on diversity at Landsec can be found on pages 35-38\n\n## Independence and re-election to the Board\n\nThe independence, e/ffectiveness and commitment of each of the Non-executive Directors has been reviewed by the Committee. The Committee is satis/fied with the contributions and time commitment of all the Non-executive Directors during the year.\n\nThe Committee will always discuss the additional commitments of all directors (including the Chairman) before recommending their approval to the Board. It also considers potential con/flict issues as part of that assessment. The Committee is mindful that Edward Bonham Carter has\n\nbeen a director of the Board in excess of nine years and has reviewed his independence and role and is completely satis/fied that Edward continues to bring independent judgement to the Board. As such the Committee is satis/fied that Edward can continue to ful/fill the role of Senior Independent Director. The Committee is con/fident that each of the Non-executive Directors remains independent and will be in a position to discharge their duties and responsibilities in the coming year. From a governance perspective, the Board as a whole is independent.\n\nSir Ian Cheshire and Miles Roberts are standing for initial election by shareholders at the AGM, with all other Directors standing for re-election at the AGM in July 2023 with the support of the Board (with the exception of Cressida Hogg who is stepping down from the Board on 16 May 2023).\n\n## Internal evaluation of the e/ffectiveness of the Nomination Committee\n\nFollowing a busy few years of Executive and Non-executive appointments, the internal review of the performance of the Nomination Committee included a review of the Chair succession process and considering the Committee's priority for the year ahead to include role pro/file planning for future non-executive recruitment and continued detailed reporting back to the main Board.",

Information security and cyber threat remains a key operational risk and the Committee has had regular oversight of the signi/ficant work undertaken to mitigate against this risk and will continue to consider updates and monitor progress of the programme to improve cyber resilience.\n\nThe macroeconomic outlook is currently the most signi/ficant risk. The risk management strategy in place to mitigate against this risk includes the regular monitoring of key risk indicators and scenario-based modelling of plausible economic trajectories. No emerging risks have been identi/fied through the risk management process.\n\n## Climate reporting\n\nThe Committee has updates from the sustainability team on how Landsec is implementing the requirements of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), the evolving reporting landscape for climate risks and our approach to climate risk identi/fication, assessment and strategy.\n\nWe have continued to make disclosures that are consistent with the TCFD recommendations and will continue to monitor these. Our TCFD disclosures can be found on pages 47 to 53.\n\n## Fire safety remediation\n\nFollowing the introduction of the Building Safety Act 2022, the Committee has been updated on work to assess our liability for /fire remediation works on residential buildings developed by Group over the last 30 years. The Committee has regularly considered, alongside the external auditor, the level of the provision required, how the provision is determined and the associated disclosures.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Group's /financial statements are of critical importance to investors and the Committee monitors the integrity of the Group's reporting process and /financial management. It scrutinises the full and half-yearly /financial statements before proposing them to the Board for approval. The Committee reviews in detail the work of the external auditor and external valuers and any signi/ficant /financial judgements and estimates made by management to ensure that it is satis/fied with the outcome.\n\nI am pleased to say that the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) included some disclosures from our 2022 Annual Report in its publication 'What Makes a Good Annual Report and Accounts', as they were considered examples of best practice.\n\n## Asset valuation\n\nThe valuation of our assets is an important constituent of our /financial results and measurement of our performance. For a number of years CBRE has been the principal valuer of our entire portfolio, however in order to increase market insight and future /flexibility, Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) has been appointed to value a large proportion of Landsec's retail portfolio with e/ffect from 31 March 2023. CBRE will continue to value the o/ffice portfolio and some of the retail portfolio. Both CBRE and JLL are industry-leading agencies with extensive expertise and appropriate knowledge who\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Highlights\n\n- \u00b7 Integrity of reporting process\n- \u00b7 Rigorous assessment of risk management and internal controls\n- \u00b7 Cyber and information security\n- \u00b7 Accounting treatment of signi/ficant acquisitions/disposals\n- \u00b7 Preparation for the new governance regime\n- \u00b7 Consideration of /fire safety provision\n- \u00b7 Appointment of third-party advisers\n- \u00b7 Financial systems transformation\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Reliability of the /financial statements and internal controls\n- \u00b7 E/ffective risk identi/fication and management\n- \u00b7 Overall transparency and /financial governance\n\n## Number of meetings and attendance\n\n- \u00b7 Four scheduled meetings\n- \u00b7 100% attendance from all members during their membership",

        "page_content": "provide us with an external valuation of our portfolio twice a year, in accordance with the relevant industry standards.\n\nThe valuation process requires the valuers to evaluate the likely future /financial performance of each individual asset and apply recent, relevant transactional evidence in the market to determine an appropriate value at the period end. The Committee analyses, challenges and debates the valuations prepared by the valuers who attend Committee meetings for this purpose at the half and full year-end. The external valuation process and the values ascribed to speci/fic assets are also reviewed independently by our auditor, EY, as part of its audit scope.\n\n## Acquisitions and disposals\n\nDuring the year, Landsec progressed with its strategy to accelerate growth through recycling capital into higher return opportunities through a number of signi/ficant disposals of 32-50 Strand, 21 Moor/fields and One New Street Square, and securing 100% ownership of St David's shopping centre in Cardi/ff via the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest. The Committee considered the accounting treatment and disclosures of these material transactions and concluded that they were appropriate.\n\n## Provisions for bad debt\n\nThe Committee has continued to closely monitor the cash collections of rents across the whole portfolio. The rent collection statistics are strong and although there remains bad debt provisions in respect of some occupiers who have been or may be unable to satisfy their rent obligations, the provisions have decreased from last year. Continual monitoring of the provisions is undertaken by the Committee particularly in light of the uncertain macro-environment.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nUntil mid-summer 2022, the internal audit function was an in-house team which sat within the Risk and Assurance team and although this was operating e/ffectively, it was considered an appropriate time to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nappoint an external third party which would increase /flexibility over audits and improve the quality of the audits as a result of access to current best practice and subject matter expertise. Following a tender process, KPMG were selected as the preferred provider and since their appointment have undertaken stakeholder interviews to understand Landsec's key risks, reviewed the internal audit plan and agreed an internal audit charter. They have completed audits on Turnover Rents, Car Park Income and Investment Appraisal. Eleven further audits are planned for the year ended 31 March 2024 and will include, amongst others, Treasury and Cash Management, U+I Post integration, Risk Management and ESG.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee considered the Company's 2023 Annual Report in the round and concluded and recommended to the Board that, taken as a whole the 2023 Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## Going concern and viability statement\n\nWe continue to focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 particularly in light of the uncertain macroeconomic environment. The going concern statement is set out on pages 60 and 61, along with the viability statement and the rationale behind the chosen /five-year time horizon.\n\n## Audit tender\n\nAs highlighted last year, we were required to tender our audit as EY were approaching being in o/ffice for ten years having performed their /first audit for Landsec for the year end 31 March 2014. A competitive and thorough tender process was undertaken during the year and following in depth consideration, the Committee and the Board concluded that EY remained the appropriate auditor for Landsec. EY would ensure continued independence through a change in partner with e/ffect from July 2022. The appointment is subject to shareholder approval at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code/ Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Guidance on Audit Committees\n\nThe Committee considered its compliance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC Guidance on Audit Committees and continues to believe that we have addressed both the spirit and the requirements of each. In addition, the Committee has been regularly monitoring the potential changes to the new corporate governance regime and preparing for its implementation, including reviewing a draft audit and assurance policy.\n\n## Committee e/ffectiveness\n\nDuring the /first half of the year the Committee requested that a speci/fic e/ffectiveness survey was undertaken to supplement and support the Board and Committee annual evaluations. This in-depth review was undertaken by internal audit and concluded that the Committee is operating well and should maintain many of its existing practices. The internal Board evaluation was undertaken later in the year, which also highlighted the high standards of the Committee.\n\nThe Committee welcomed Miles Roberts who joined as a member of the Committee in September 2022, replacing Christophe Evain. Myself and the Committee would like to thank Christophe for his valued contributions.\n\nI continue to appreciate the valuable input from the other members of the Audit Committee, management and the key advisers EY, KPMG, CBRE and JLL and would like to thank them for their support during the year.\n\nNicholas Cadbury Chairman, Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

These were last approved in March 2023. The terms of reference are available on our website: landsec.com/aboutcorporategovernance/board-committees .\n\nTo maintain e/ffective communication between all relevant parties, and in support of its activities, the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive, Chief Financial O/fficer, Company Secretary, Director of Risk and Assurance, the partner and representatives of our external auditor, EY, the partner and representatives of our internal auditor, KPMG and other members of the senior /finance team regularly attend Committee meetings.\n\nAll directors are invited to attend meetings when the Group's external valuers, CBRE, and JLL, present their full year and halfyear property valuation.\n\nThe Committee has private and informal sessions with the EY audit team and the CBRE and JLL valuation teams to ensure that open lines of communication exist, in case they wish to raise any concerns outside of formal meetings.\n\nThe Committee members are all independent Non-executive Directors and collectively have a broad range of /financial, commercial and property sector expertise that enables them to provide oversight of both /financial and risk matters, and to advise the Board accordingly. The Board has determined that Nicholas Cadbury, as Chairman of the Committee, has recent and relevant /financial experience for the purposes of satisfying the UK Corporate Governance Code. Details of the experience of all members of the Committee can be found on pages 66 and 67.\n\nThe Committee works to a structured programme of activities and meetings to coincide with key events around our /financial calendar and, on behalf of the Board, to provide oversight of the Group's risk management process.

The risk management framework includes the Board's strategic overview, the Executive Leadership Team's detailed review of the business risks, controls and mitigation strategies, and the assessment of the e/ffectiveness of the risk management and internal controls system by the Audit Committee. A risk waterfall uses indicators to highlight whether each risk is within our appetite. This allows the Committee to consider whether principal risks are changing and whether the risk appetite remains appropriate. In response to changes in Landsec's organisational structure, the risk management framework has been rede/fined in order to ensure clarity on roles and responsibilities at all levels and to embed risk management within the business.\n\nPrimary responsibility for the operation of the Company's internal control and risk management systems, which extend to include /financial, operational and compliance controls (and accord with the FRC's 2014 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting'), has been delegated to management.\n\nThese systems have been designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve the Group's business goals and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk assurance and internal control\n\nUnder the overall supervision of the Committee, there are several subcommittees and working groups that give assurance over risks being managed within the business. The Group has a Director of Risk and Assurance (with a direct reporting line to the Audit Committee Chairman) who provides regular oversight of risk matters, evaluates emerging risks and monitors compliance to ensure that any mitigating actions are properly managed and completed. During the year the Committee bene/fited from regular updates from the technology team who provided detailed information on the progress of the projects to improve information security, cyber threat and processes to assist with /financial controls. In addition, the EY team now includes a partner with expertise on technology and cyber.\n\nInternal audits are carried out in accordance with an agreed annual assurance plan and reviewed by the Committee throughout the year. This plan was previously undertaken by the in-house internal audit team and is now the responsibility of KPMG who were appointed as internal auditor during the year following a tender process. It was considered appropriate to appoint a third party in order to increase /flexibility over the audits and improve the quality of the audits due to access to current best practice and subject matter expertise.\n\nBoth the in-house team and KPMG have provided assurance to the Committee on key controls and programme assurance and identi/fied improvements in key /financial processes.\n\nThe key elements of the Group's risk management and internal control systems are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 an established organisational structure with clear lines of responsibility, approval levels and delegated authorities\n- \u00b7 a disciplined internal governance structure which facilitates regular performance review and decision making\n\n- \u00b7 a comprehensive strategic and business planning review\n- \u00b7 a robust budgeting, forecasting and /financial reporting process\n- \u00b7 various policies, procedures and guidelines underpinning the development, asset management and /financing operations of the business\n- \u00b7 a compliance certi/fication process conducted in relation to the half-yearly and full year results, and business activities generally\n- \u00b7 a quarterly key controls self-certi/fication by management\n- \u00b7 an internal audit function provided by KPMG whose work spans the whole Group\n- \u00b7 a focused post-acquisition review and integration programme to ensure the Group's governance, procedures, standards and control environment are implemented e/ffectively and on time\n- \u00b7 a /financial and property information management system\n- \u00b7 a whistleblowing process that enables concerns to be reported con/fidentially and on an anonymous basis and for those concerns to be investigated.\n\nAdditionally, the Committee discusses on a quarterly basis:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group's signi/ficant and emerging risks, and how exposures have changed during the period\n- \u00b7 the e/ffectiveness of internal controls and processes at mitigating those risks\n- \u00b7 internal audit reports, summary reports of /findings and recommendations from completion of the internal audit plan\n- \u00b7 progress against completion of agreed actions from the internal audit reports.\n\nThe Committee was satis/fied that the system of risk management and internal controls has been e/ffective throughout the year.",

If it picks up any information as part of this process, it would report to the Audit Committee anything that it believes the Committee should know in order to ful/fil its duties and responsibilities. As audit partner, Julie Carlyle is authorised to contact the Committee Chairman directly at any time to raise any matter of concern.\n\n## Audit plan\n\nEY presented its proposed audit plan (reviewed by senior management and the Director of Risk and Assurance), to the Committee for discussion. The objective was to ensure that the focus of its work remained aligned to the Group's structure and strategy.\n\nThe Committee is keen to ensure that its auditor feels able to challenge management and is a/fforded all the access it requires to report on matters that may not be part of the statutory audit but which, in the opinion of the auditor, should be brought to the attention of the Audit Committee. These matters may be /financial or non-/financial and may be based on fact or opinion (including any concern over culture or behaviour). An example may be the use or adequacy of any controls used by the Company to detect any fraud or improper behaviour.\n\nEY is a/fforded such access through attendance at each Committee meeting, supported by other meetings held during the year with the Committee or the Committee Chairman without management being\n\npresent and the knowledge that it can raise any matter of concern to the Committee Chairman at any time without going through management. These regular discussions were useful to the Committee but no matters of concern emerged.\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the objectivity and independence of the external auditor. In undertaking its annual assessment, the Committee took into account the UK Ethical Independence Standards introduced by the FRC in December 2019 and e/ffective from 15 March 2020.\n\nThe Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 the con/firmation from EY that it maintains appropriate internal safeguards in line with applicable professional standards, together with an explanation of the due diligence process followed to provide such a con/firmation\n- \u00b7 the mitigation actions we take in seeking to safeguard EY's independent status, including the operation of policies designed to regulate the amount of non-audit services provided by EY and the employment of former EY employees\n- \u00b7 the tenure of the audit engagement partner (not being greater than /five years); Julie Carlyle was appointed as EY audit partner to the Group in July 2022\n- \u00b7 the internal performance and e/ffectiveness review of EY referred to above.\n\nNo Committee member has any connection with the current auditor.\n\nTaking the above review into account, the Committee concluded that EY remained objective and independent in its role as external auditor.\n\n## E/ffectiveness of the external audit\n\nFollowing the issue of our Annual Report each year, the Director of Risk and Assurance conducts a performance evaluation and e/ffectiveness review of the external audit. This is conducted against\n\nstructured guidelines in consultation with the Executive Directors and members of the senior /finance team and members of the Audit Committee to whom they report. The Committee Chairman met privately with the audit engagement partner before the Committee meeting to consider the results of the e/ffectiveness review. The Committee's preliminary view is that EY has continued to perform its audit services e/ffectively and to a high standard, and this is consistent with performance each year since appointment in 2013. Areas identi/fied for development will be shared with EY for inclusion in its audit and service delivery plans going forward.\n\n## Audit tendering\n\nEY was /first appointed to the o/ffice of auditor in respect of the 2013/14 /financial year.\n\nUnder current regulations, we were required to re-tender the audit by no later than the 2023/24 /financial year and therefore a competitive audit tender process was undertaken during the year which concluded that EY remained the appropriate auditor for Landsec, as recommended by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board. The evaluation criteria used during the tender process included the capability and competence of the audit partner, team and /firm, the audit approach and service, cultural /fit, quality of deliverables and presentation, and fees. EY were selected because the proposed team would provide a mix of continuity and embedded knowledge with the comfort of independence via a new partner, their ability to provide a partner with technology expertise embedded within the team, a strong commitment on audit approach and service, and a driven and enthusiastic outlook.\n\nThe decision on the appointment was made by the Board without any in/fluence by a third party, and without any contractual term of the kind mentioned in Article 16(6) of the Audit Regulation being imposed on the Company.",

        "page_content": "EY will be appointed for the 31 March 2024 /financial year at this year's Annual General Meeting, subject to shareholder approval.\n\nThe Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order 2014 for the year under review.\n\n## Audit fee\n\nThe audit fees payable to EY for 2022/23 (including the audit of the Group's joint ventures) are \u00a31.8m (2021/22: \u00a31.8m). This fee takes into account a reduction in the number of Group subsidiaries that will be audited as they have taken advantage of the exemption from having accounts audited under s479A-479C of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nTo help safeguard EY's objectivity and independence, we operate a non-audit services policy that sets out the circumstances and /financial limits within which EY may be permitted to provide certain non-audit services.\n\n## Audit vs. non-audit fees 2022/23 (including the audit of the Group's joint ventures)\n\nChart 34\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22.5% non-audit fees as a ratio to Group audit fee (excluding the audit of the Group's joint ventures).\n\nThe Committee monitors compliance with the policy, including the prior approvals required for non-audit services, and approval levels are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                  | Per assignment   (\u00a3)   | Aggregate   during the year   (\u00a3)   |\n|------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| 0-25,000         | <100,000               | Chief  Financial  O/fficer          |\n| 25,000-  100,000 | 100,000- 900,000*      | Audit  Committee  Chairman          |\n| >100,000         | >900,000*              | Committee                           |\n\n*50% of the prior year audit fee\n\nAll approvals are noted at the Audit Committee.\n\nEY was engaged during the year to provide non-audit services to the Group relating to the Company's half-yearly review, the assurance statement on sustainability, non-statutory audit of the Security Group, work in relation to the update of the bond programme documentation and the issuance of the Green bond. It was decided that it would be in the interest of the Company to use EY for these services, recognising that the use of audit /firms for non-audit work should generally be kept to a minimum. Total fees for non-audit services, amounted to \u00a3359,000. Details of the fees charged by EY during the year can be found in note 8 to the /financial statements.\n\nNo non-audit fees were approved or paid on a contingent basis.\n\n## External valuations and valuers\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio, including properties held within the development programme and in joint arrangements, is undertaken by external valuers. The Group provides input, such as source data, and support to the valuation process. CBRE has been the Company's principal valuer since 2015 and Jones Lang LaSalle Limited (JLL) was appointed as joint valuer to undertake the valuation of a large part of the retail portfolio whilst CBRE will retain the valuation of the o/ffice portfolio and some of the retail portfolio. This change was implemented to increase market insight and future /flexibility, and therefore the overall quality of the valuations.\n\nThe valuation helps to determine a signi/ficant part of the Group's total property return and net asset value, which have consequential implications for the Group's reported performance and the level of variable remuneration received by senior management through bonus and long-term incentive schemes. Accordingly, the scrutiny of each valuation and the valuer's objectivity and e/ffectiveness represent an important part of the Committee's work.\n\nValuations for the half-year results were presented to the Committee by CBRE, and by CBRE and JLL for the full-year results. These were reviewed and challenged by the Committee, with reference to each valuer's approach, methodology, valuation basis and underlying property and market assumptions. Other Non-executive Directors attended the full and half-year presentations. The Committee Chairman and other members of the Committee also had separate meetings with the valuer's as part of this process to provide an opportunity to test and challenge the valuation outcomes and the principles and evidence used in the determination.\n\nAdditionally, CBRE and JLL met with EY and exchanged information independently of management. EY has experienced chartered surveyors on its team who consider the valuer's quali/fications and assess and challenge the valuation approach, assumptions and judgements made by them. Their audit procedures are targeted at addressing the risks in respect of the valuations and the potential for any undue management in/fluence in arriving at them. This year 41 properties (comprising 78% of the portfolio) were identi/fied for substantive review by its valuation experts primarily on the basis of their value, type, risk pro/file, commitments to ESG and location. The Committee reviewed the auditor's /findings.\n\nAn internal evaluation of the valuers' performance and e/ffectiveness will be conducted after the year-end results are /finalised, with the results reported to the Committee.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Report of the Audit Committee continued\n\nThe Committee considered the independence of the valuers and has noted that CBRE and JLL check for con/flicts of interest and seek approval for non-valuation activity and this process has been e/ffective during the year. CBRE and JLL have also con/firmed that their valuation departments operate separately from other advisory activity, and their valuation remuneration is not linked to other non-valuation work that they undertake.\n\nA /fixed-fee arrangement (subject to adjustment for acquisitions and disposals) is in place with the valuers for the valuation of the Group's properties and, given the importance of their work, we have disclosed the fees paid to them in note 9 to the /financial statements. These fees re/flect the valuers work on the year-end and half-yearly valuations as well as other work on agency services including investment activity. The total valuation fees paid by the Company to CBRE and JLL during the year represented less than 5% of their total fee income for the year.\n\n## Signi/ficant /financial matters\n\nThe Committee reviewed four signi/ficant /financial matters in connection with the /financial statements, namely the valuation of the Group's property portfolio, revenue recognition, /fire safety remediation provisions and signi/ficant acquisitions and disposals. Further details are set out in the table on page 95.\n\nThese items were considered to be signi/ficant taking into account the level of materiality and the degree of judgement exercised by management and, in respect of the valuation, the external valuers.\n\nIn addition, the Committee considered, and made onward recommendations to the Board, as appropriate, in respect of other key matters including impairment of trade receivables, including lease incentive balances, development contracts, pensions buy-in, maintenance of the Group's REIT status, /financial systems transformation (including controls, processes and system\n\nupgrades and improvements), going concern, and other speci/fic areas of individual property and audit focus.\n\nThe Committee was satis/fied that all issues had been fully and adequately addressed and that the judgements made were reasonable and appropriate and had been reviewed and debated with the external auditor who concurred with the approach taken by management.\n\n## Non-/financial matters\n\nThe Committee understands the level of reliance that is placed by shareholders on the statutory audit and the report of the external auditor.\n\nWe report on alternative performance measures on page 199. The Committee debated and discussed these measures and agreed that they were appropriate for the business.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee applied the same due diligence approach adopted in previous years in order to assess whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable, one of the key UK Corporate Governance Code requirements. The Committee received assurance from the veri/fication process carried out on the content of the Annual Report by the Executive Leadership Team to ensure consistent reporting and the existence of appropriate links between key messages and relevant sections of the Annual Report. Particular attention has been given this year to the consistency of the narrative disclosures around climate risks, our strategy and the /financial statements.\n\nTaking the above into account, together with the views expressed by EY, the Committee recommended, and in turn the Board con/firmed, that the 2023 Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the necessary information for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Whistleblowing policy\n\nThe Audit Committee provides a regular whistleblowing update to the Board, which has overall responsibility for whistleblowing. The Audit Committee reviews the Group's Speak up policy which allows employees and third parties to report concerns about suspected impropriety or wrongdoing (whether /financial or otherwise) on a con/fidential basis, and anonymously if preferred. This includes an independent third-party reporting facility comprising a telephone hotline and an alternative online process. Any matters reported are investigated by the Company Secretary, Chief People O/fficer and the Director of Risk and Assurance and escalated to the Committee, as appropriate. During the year two whistleblowing incidents were reported. One matter was investigated and no concerns or action were required following conclusion of the investigation. The second matter, which was reported close to the year-end is being fully investigated.\n\nWe monitor whistleblowing awareness and remind employees that a dedicated hotline exists should they ever need to 'blow the whistle'. The arrangements also form part of the induction programme for new employees. Details of the whistleblowing hotline are included in our Supply Chain Commitment, Sustainability Toolkit, procurement tender documentation, on our website, and at our assets and development sites.",

Our performance has been underpinned by a strong balance sheet, creating signi/ficant optionality for future growth.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nWe have continued to operate under the Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at our 2021 AGM. The Committee believes that the Policy provides strong alignment with our ambitious strategy whilst following best practice in corporate governance and providing an appropriate level of /flexibility. We are next due to put forward an updated Policy for approval at the 2024 AGM and the Committee will start the process to review the Policy this summer.\n\n## Performance for the 2022/23 /financial year\n\nDuring the course of the year, executive management has continued to drive the business strategy forward. In Central London we delivered continued strong leasing results as well as the disposal of \u00a31.4bn of mature o/ffices. In retail we delivered strong leasing momentum via our di/fferentiated brand focused platform capitalising on the '/flight to prime', with 6.9% year on year sales growth. In mixeduse we have secured planning consent for our major Finchley Road project and signed a drawdown agreement for the /first phase of land at May/field, progressing preparations for our 11m sq ft pipeline. Despite the general macro challenges, our performance highlights the high quality of the Landsec platform and portfolio and strong progress on executing strategy since\n\nlate 2020, creating balance sheet resilience and optionality for future growth.\n\nWe are a purpose-led business and aim to create value for all stakeholders. Our strategy for the coming year continues to focus on shaping Central London o/ffices, major retail destinations and mixed-use urban neighbourhoods.\n\nFor the year ended 31 March 2023, whilst asset values decreased by 7.7% in aggregate owing to wider economic conditions, EPRA earnings were up 10.7% and net debt has reduced by \u00a30.9bn, reducing LTV by 2.7% to 31.7% in line with our LTV target range of 25% to 40% and net debt/EBITDA from 9.7x to 7.0x. Our current development pipeline is 60% pre-let or under o/ffer. In Central London, \u00a348m of lettings were completed or in solicitors' hands, 5% ahead of valuers' assumptions, and occupancy up 110bps to 95.9%. In Major retail destinations, \u00a338m of lettings were completed or in solicitors' hands, 9% ahead of ERV with occupancy up 110bps to 94.3%. These results are clearly re/flected in the variable pay awarded to the Executive Directors.\n\n## Annual bonus performance\n\nThe performance of the Executive Team has been both focused and decisive, with progress made in all areas of the strategic plan that was set out at the start of the year. This performance was achieved despite increased macroeconomic uncertainties including in/flation tensions owing to geopolitical issues and the energy crisis leading to increased interest rates. Signi/ficant achievements include completing on key transactions at attractive prices including the sale of 21 Moor/fields and One New Street Square. We further strengthened our sector-leading balance sheet with the issue of our inaugural \u00a3400m Green bond in challenging bond market conditions. We also carried out an organisational restructure enabling us to hold overhead costs stable year on year despite rising in/flation. This leaves the Group well placed to pursue growth opportunities.

The Committee has carefully considered the performance against the targets, business outcomes and the wider stakeholder context and believes that it is appropriate for the Executive Directors to receive annual bonuses for 2022/23. The assessment against the targets resulted in overall bonus outcomes of 50% of maximum (equating to 75.04% of salary), which is considered to be appropriate in the context of the performance of the business.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan performance\n\nVesting of the 2020 LTIP in 2023 was determined by performance against two equally weighted measures of Total Property Return (TPR) and Total Shareholder Return (TSR) relative to FTSE 350 real estate companies. Performance under the TPR measure was below threshold while TSR was between threshold and maximum over the three years to 31 March 2023. As such, and after consideration of the value of the shares expected to vest, 37.69% of the 2020 LTIP awards will vest.\n\nIn addition, the 2021 buyout award granted to Vanessa Simms was determined by performance measured against the same targets as the 2021 LTIP award, albeit over two years to 31 March 2023. Performance against the Total Accounting Return (TAR) measure (now called Total Return on Equity (TRE)) was below threshold, TSR was upper quartile and ESG (reduction in carbon emissions) was above maximum over the two years to 31 March 2023. As such, 60% of the 2021 buyout award will vest.\n\n## Executive Director change\n\nColette O'Shea left the Board on 30 September 2022 and stepped down from her role as Chief Operating O/fficer with e/ffect from 31 March 2023 after a transitional period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Discretion\n\nNo positive discretion was exercised in the year ended 31 March 2023. Negative discretion has been used to reduce the value of an unbudgeted surrender premium received from EPRA earnings prior to calculating the annual bonus outcome. This was recommended by management and agreed by the Committee given that the surrender premium was unbudgeted and was not therefore factored into the original earnings targets.\n\n## Executive remuneration 2023/24\n\n## 1. Base salary\n\nFrom 1 June 2023, Executive Director salaries will increase by 4%. The payrise across the wider workforce was 6.75% (5% of which was accelerated and paid from 1 January 2023 to assist employees with the cost of living crisis). This was in addition to a one-o/ff award of \u00a31,000 paid to all employees earning below \u00a340,000 p.a.\n\n## 2. Pension and bene/fits\n\nConsistent with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Executive Director pension contributions are aligned to the wider workforce at 10.5% of salary. No changes will be made to bene/fit provision other than a switch from a car to a travel allowance for Vanessa Simms.\n\n## 3. Annual bonus\n\nFor the year ending 31 March 2024, Executive Directors will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 150% of salary. Our bonus scheme, which remains aligned to our strategy, combines stretching targets for earnings, Total Return on Equity (TRE) (previously known as Total Accounting Return (TAR)) and ESG for the year ending 31 March 2024. Personal objectives will continue to apply for a minority of the award.\n\n## 4. Long-Term Incentive Plan\n\nWe intend to grant awards under the LTIP in June 2023 which will be subject to performance conditions measured over a three-year performance period. Performance targets will continue to be based on TRE (previously known as TAR), relative TSR, and carbon reduction. Any awards which vest will be subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period.\n\n## Remuneration across the Company\n\nThe Committee oversees all remuneration policies and practices across the organisation, and is regularly briefed by the Chief People O/fficer in this regard. The Committee takes account of the interests of all internal and external stakeholders when making any decisions on remuneration matters. During the year ended 31 March 2023, we continued to grant LTIP awards below the Executive Leadership Team, more closely aligning those who execute our strategy on a daily basis with the interests of our shareholders.\n\n## Employee voice\n\nIn April 2023, I took the opportunity to meet with members of our Employee Forum (which represents the wider Landsec workforce). This is an important activity and I was pleased to answer a number of questions posed by the forum on pay ratios, pay structures, LTIPs, base salary and investor views on remuneration.\n\n## E/ffectiveness\n\nDuring the year the Committee reviewed its own e/ffectiveness and the e/ffectiveness of FIT as advisers to the Committee. Overall, the Committee was satis/fied with the e/ffectiveness of both. Follow-up actions included streamlining Committee processes and ensuring proactive responses to issues and advice.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nDespite increased macroeconomic uncertainty, Landsec's Executive Team continue to lead the business to deliver strong operational results and active execution on strategy. I am grateful for the engagement and support provided by our shareholders and welcome your feedback.\n\nChristophe Evain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee",

Where the minimum level is not met, or where the value of shareholding falls below the required level due to movements in the share price, the Executive Director is expected to retain 100% of the shares acquired, net of tax, under any share plan awarded by the Company.\n\nNon-executive Directors are expected to meet the minimum shareholding requirements within three years of appointment to the Board. The shareholding requirements are considered met once the Non-executive Director has obtained the required holding value and, provided those shares are retained, no adjustment is required due to movements in the share price.\n\n| Directors' shares Name   | Salary/  base fee at  31 March 2023 (\u00a3)   | Minimum  shareholding  requirements  (% of salary/ base fee) 5   | Required holding  value (\u00a3)   | Holding (ordinary shares) 1 April 2022   | Holding (ordinary shares) 31 March 2023   | Deferred bonus shares under holding  period   | Value of   holding  (\u00a3) 1   | Table 48 Met  requirement  or building in  line with  policy   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Mark Allan               | 824,000                                   | 300%                                                             | 2,472,000                     | 214,531                                  | 229,203                                   | 66,555                                        | 1,837,249                   | Building                                                       |\n| Vanessa Simms            | 504,700                                   | 200%                                                             | 1,009,400                     | 48,292                                   | 51,400                                    | 34,542                                        | 533,872                     | Building                                                       |\n| Colette O'Shea2          | 494,400                                   | 200%                                                             | 988,800                       | 107,730                                  | 107,730                                   | 38,598                                        | 908,990                     | Building                                                       |\n| Cressida Hogg            | 375,000                                   | 100%                                                             | 375,000                       | 41,375                                   | 41,375                                    | -

Challenging sliding scale targets will operate and the Remuneration Committee will retain discretion to ensure any payouts against the targets re/flect the underlying performance of the Company. Performance targets are considered to be commercially sensitive although will be disclosed in full, together with the performance and the resulting bonus awards, in next year's Directors' Remuneration Report.\n\n| Annual bonus 2023/24: Performance criteria   | Annual bonus 2023/24: Performance criteria   | Annual bonus 2023/24: Performance criteria                                                                               | Table 56   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Measure                                      | Weighting                                    | Description                                                                                                              |            |\n| EPRA earnings                                | 30%                                          | EPRA earnings targets - split 50/50 between Actual and Like-for-Like performance.                                        |            |\n| TRE (previously  called TAR)                 | 30%                                          | Delivery of EPRA NTA targets (adjusted for dividends) through pro-active asset management.                               |            |\n| ESG                                          | 20%                                          | A milestones approach as per the approach adopted in 2022/23 based on energy e/fficiency and embodied  carbon reduction. |            |\n| Personal objectives                          | 20%                                          | A mix of individual goals set at the beginning of the year.                                                              |            |\n| Total annual bonus                           | 100%                                         |                                                                                                                          |            |\n\n## LTIP 2023-2026: Performance criteria\n\n| Measure                      | Weighting   | Description                                                                                                                | Performance range 1    |                              |\n|------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| TSR                          | 40%         | TSR relative to the constituents of the FTSE 350 Real Estate  Index, measured over a three-year period, from 1 April 2023. | Threshold (8%) Median  | Maximum (40%) Upper quartile |\n| TRE (previously  called TAR) | 40%         | Growth in EPRA NTA per share over the three-year  performance period as adjusted for dividends.                            | Threshold (0%) 2% p.a. | Maximum (40%) 10% p.a.       |\n| ESG                          | 20%         | Reduction of carbon emissions over the three-year  performance period.                                                     | Threshold (4%) 25.4%   | Maximum (20%) 31.0%          |\n| Total LTIP                   | 100%        |                                                                                                                            |                        |                              |\n\n- 1.

Relative TSR is based on an unweighted, median to upper quartile vesting schedule and TRE (previously called TAR) targets deliver a close alignment to strategy and a clear line of sight for management. The widening of the TRE targets from the prior year awards re/flects elevated volatility levels in the market. The 2% to 10% p.a. TRE target range compares with a 4% to 10% p.a. range set for the 2021 LTIPs and a 6% to 11% p.a. range set for the 2022 LTIPs. However, re/flecting the lower threshold for the 2023 LTIP award, the level of vesting for this part of the award has been reduced from the 20% normally operated to 0%, with a pro-rata vesting between threshold and maximum.\n\nThe 2023 LTIP award will be set at up to 300% of salary for the CEO and CFO.\n\n## 4. Total Shareholder Return and Chief Executive pay\n\nThe following graphs illustrate the performance of the Company measured by TSR (share price growth plus dividends paid) against a 'broad equity market index'. In addition to the ten-year period required by the disclosure regulations, a /five-year period has also been presented to demonstrate Landsec's performance more recently. As the Company is a constituent of the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, this is considered to be the most appropriate benchmark for the purposes of the graphs. An additional line to illustrate the Company's performance compared with the FTSE 100 Index over the previous /five and ten years is also included.\n\nThis graph shows the value, by 31 March 2023, of \u00a3100 invested in Landsec on 31 March 2018, compared with the value of \u00a3100 invested in the FTSE 100 and FTSE 350 Real Estate Indices on the same date.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Senior management\n\nFor the year under review, performance-related pay for our 37 most senior employees (excluding the Executive Directors) ranged from 27% to 72% of salary (2022: 33% to 87%), equating to 45% to 60% of the maximum potential. The average bonus was 33.9% of salary (2022: 51.4%), equating to 49% of the maximum potential.\n\n## b. All other employees\n\nExecutive Directors' base salaries were increased by 3% in 2022, which was below the workforce average increase of 5%. From 1 June 2023, Executive Director salaries will increase by 4%. The pay rise across the wider workforce was 6.75% (5% of which was accelerated and paid from 1 January 2023 to assist employees with the cost of living crisis).\n\nIn addition, in autumn 2022, we made a one-o/ff payment of \u00a31,000 to employees earning below \u00a340,000.\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, the ratio of the base salary of the Chief Executive to the average base salary across the Group (excluding Executive Directors) was 10:1 (\u00a382,948: \u00a3824,000).",

This will impact comparative numbers in both years.\n\n|                         | 2020/21                | 2020/21               | 2020/21            | 2021/22                | 2021/22               | 2021/22            | Table 61               | Table 61              | Table 61           |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|\n|                         | Salary/fee  change (%) | Bene/fits  change (%) | Bonus  change  (%) | Salary/fee  change (%) | Bene/fits  change (%) | Bonus  change  (%) | Salary/fee  change (%) | Bene/fits  change (%) | Bonus  change  (%) |\n| Executive Directors     |                        |                       |                    |                        |                       |                    |                        |                       |                    |\n| Mark Allan              | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 9%                     | -75%                  | 479%               | 3%                     | -3%                   | -43%               |\n| Vanessa Simms1          | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 13%                    | 24%                   | -38%               |\n| Colette O'Shea2         | 3%                     | -3%                   | -65%               | 5%                     | 0%                    | 389%               | -49%                   | -50%                  | -71%               |\n| Non-executive Directors |                        |                       |                    |                        |                       |                    |                        |                       |                    |\n| Cressida Hogg           | -5%                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 5%                     | n/a                   | n/a                | 0%                     | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Edward Bonham Carter    | -15%                   | n/a                   | n/a                | 3%                     | n/a                   | n/a                | 0%                     | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Nicholas Cadbury        | -5%                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 5%                     | n/a                   | n/a                | 0%                     | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Sir Ian Cheshire 3      |                        |                       |                    |                        |                       |                    | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Madeleine Cosgrave      | -5%                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 5%                     | n/a                   | n/a                | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Christophe Evain        | 16%                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 7%                     | 100%                  | n/a                | 0%                     | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Miles Roberts 4         |                        |                       |                    |                        |                       |                    | 0%                     | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Manjiry Tamhane         | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                | n/a                    | n/a                   | n/a                | 0%                     | n/a                   | n/a                |\n| Average employee        | 7%                     | 6%                    | -49%               | -1%                    | 2%                    | 219%               | 15%                    | -24%                  | -12                |\n\n- 1. Vanessa Simms joined the Board during 2021/22.\n- 2. Colette O'Shea stepped down from the Board on 30 September 2022 therefore comparing part-year (FY22/23) with full year prior.\n- 3. Sir Ian Cheshire was appointed on 23 March 2023.\n- 4. Miles Roberts was appointed on 19 September 2022.\n\n## d. CEO pay ratio\n\nThe tables below show how pay for the CEO compares to employees at the lower, median and upper quartiles (calculated on a full-time equivalent basis). The ratios have been calculated in accordance with Option A of The Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018, which uses the total pay and bene/fits for all employees, and is the same methodology that is used to calculate the CEO's single /figure of remuneration table on page 101. Figures are calculated by reference to 31 March 2023 using actual pay data from April 2022 to March 2023. Excluded from our analysis are joiners, leavers and long-term absentees from the Company during the year. As the CEO has a larger proportion of his total remuneration linked to business performance than other employees in the UK workforce, the ratio has increased versus last year primarily as a result of the partial vesting of the 2020 LTIP (the 2019 LTIP did not vest last year) more than o/ffsetting the reduced bonus award for the year ended 31 March 2023. Given the alignment of incentive arrangements cascaded below Board level, the Remuneration Committee believes the pay ratios are consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the Group's UK employees taken as a whole.\n\n| Year      | Method     | 25th percentile pay ratio   | Median pay ratio   | Table 62 75th percentile pay ratio   |\n|-----------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 2022/23   | Option A   | 49:1                        | 30:1               | 18:1                                 |\n| 2021/22   | Option A   | 40:1                        | 25:1               | 16:1                                 |\n| 2020/21   | Option A   | 22:1                        | 14:1               | 10:1                                 |\n| 2019/20   | Option A   | 36:1                        | 23:1               | 15:1                                 |\n|           | CEO pay    | P25 pay                     | P50 pay            | P75 pay                              |\n| Salary    | \u00a3820,000   | \u00a343,811                     | \u00a364,851            | \u00a3104,813                             |\n| Total pay | \u00a32,657,730 | \u00a354,032                     | \u00a387,925            | \u00a3145,648                             |",

Including base salaries for all employees, bonus and share-based payments.\n- 2. Dividend paid represents dividends declared for the year. See note 11 to the /financial statements.\n\n## 6. Dilution\n\nAwards granted under the Company's long-term incentive arrangements (LTIP, Deferred Share Bonus Plan, Restricted Share Plan and the ESOP) are satis/fied through the funding of an Employee Bene/fit Trust (administered by an external trustee) which acquires existing Land Securities Group PLC shares in the market. The Employee Bene/fit Trust held 781,456 ordinary shares (2022: 888,400) and 3,049,943 treasury shares (2022: 3,049,943) at 31 March 2023.\n\nThe exercise of share options under the Land Securities Group PLC Sharesave, which is open to all employees who have completed more than one month's service with the Group, can be satis/fied by the allotment of newly issued shares. At 31 March 2023, the total number of shares which could be allotted under this Scheme was 565,439 shares (2022: 635,473), which represents less than 0.08% (2022: 0.09%) of the issued share capital of the Company.\n\n## 7. Remuneration Committee meetings\n\nThe Committee met for three scheduled meetings and one unscheduled meeting over the course of the year. All members attended all the scheduled meetings with the exception of one meeting which Christophe Evain could not attend owing to a family bereavement. The Committee meetings were normally also attended by the Chief Executive, the Chief People O/fficer and Company Secretary who acted as the Committee's Secretary.\n\nThe Committee received advice on remuneration and ancillary share plan matters from FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP. FIT is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and is a signatory to its Code of Conduct, which requires their advice to be impartial. The Committee is satis/fied that the advice it receives is independent and objective. Aside from some support in benchmarking remuneration for roles below the Board, FIT has no other connection with the Group. For the /financial year under review, FIT received fees of \u00a375,676 (FY2022: \u00a366,610) in connection with advice provided to the Committee.\n\n## 8.

        "page_content": "## Shareholder voting rights and restrictions on transfer of shares\n\nAll the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Landsec have equal voting rights with one vote per share. There are no special control rights attaching to them save that the control rights of ordinary shares held in the EBT can be directed by the Company to satisfy the vesting of outstanding awards under its various employee share plans.\n\nIn relation to the EBT, the Trustee has agreed not to vote any shares held in the EBT at any general meeting. If any o/ffer is made to all shareholders to acquire their shares in Landsec, the Trustee will not be obliged to accept or reject the o/ffer in respect of any shares which are at the time subject to subsisting awards, but will have regard to the interests of the award holders and will have power to consult them to obtain their views on the o/ffer. Subject to the above, the Trustee may take such action with respect to an o/ffer as it thinks /fit.\n\nLandsec is not aware of any agreements or control rights between existing shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities or on voting rights. The rights, including full details relating to voting of shareholders and any restrictions on transfer relating to Landsec's ordinary shares, are set out in the Articles and in the explanatory notes that accompany the Notice of the 2023 AGM. These documents are available on Landsec's website at: landsec.com/agm .\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are a number of agreements that take e/ffect, alter or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following a takeover. None of these are considered signi/ficant. The Company's share plans contain provisions that take e/ffect in such an event but do not entitle participants to a greater interest in the shares of the Company than created by the initial grant or award under the relevant plan. There are no agreements between the Company and its Directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of o/ffice or employment or otherwise that occurs speci/fically because of a takeover.\n\n## Human rights and equal opportunities\n\nLandsec operates a Human Rights Policy which aims to recognise and safeguard the human rights of all citizens in the business areas under our control. We support the principles set out within both the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our Policy is built on these foundations including, without limitation, the principles of equal opportunities, collective bargaining, freedom of association and protection from forced or child labour.\n\nThe Policy takes account of the Modern Slavery Act that came into force in October 2015 and requires Landsec to report annually on its workforce and supply chain, speci/fically to con/firm that workers are not enslaved or tra/fficked. Landsec's latest Modern Slavery Statement was approved by the Board on 8 September 2022 and posted on our website the same day.\n\nLandsec is an equal opportunities employer and our range of employment policies and guidelines re/flects legal and employment requirements in the UK and safeguards the interests of employees, potential employees and other workers. We do not condone unfair treatment of any kind and o/ffer equal opportunities in all aspects of employment and advancement regardless of race, nationality, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, disability, religious or political beliefs. Landsec recognises that it has clear obligations towards all its employees and the community at large to ensure that disabled people are a/fforded equal opportunities to enter employment and progress. Landsec has therefore established procedures designed to provide fair consideration and selection of disabled applicants and to satisfy their training and career development needs. If an employee becomes disabled, wherever possible Landsec takes steps to provide reasonable adjustments to their existing employment arrangements, or by redeployment and providing appropriate retraining to enable continued employment in the Group. Further information can be found on pages 34-39.\n\n## Political donations\n\nThe Company did not make any political donations or expenditure in the year that require disclosure (2022: nil).\n\n## Auditor and disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nSo far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information that has not been brought to the attention of the Company's auditor. Each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that such information was provided to the auditor.\n\nA resolution to con/firm the reappointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor of the Company will be proposed at the 2023 AGM. The reappointment has been recommended to the Board by the Audit Committee and EY has indicated its willingness to remain in o/ffice.\n\n## 2023 Annual General Meeting\n\nThis year's AGM is scheduled to be held at 10.00 am on Thursday, 6 July 2023 at 80 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL.\n\nA separate circular, comprising a letter from the Chairman, Notice of Meeting and explanatory notes in respect of the resolutions proposed, can be found on our website: landsec.com/agm .\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe purpose of this Annual Report is to provide information to the members of the Company and it has been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company as a body, and no other persons. The Company, its Directors and employees, agents and advisers do not accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this document is shown or into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed.\n\nA cautionary statement in respect of forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report appears on the inside back cover of this document.\n\nThe Directors' Report was approved by the Board on 15 May 2023.\n\nBy Order of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMarina Thomas Company Secretary\n\nLand Securities Group PLC Company number 4369054",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and Parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the /financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have ful/filled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe Non-Audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the /financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the /financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing the risk around going concern in planning our audit, at the interim and again at the year-end phase.\n- \u00b7 con/firming our understanding of the Group's going concern assessment process and reviewing management's related Board papers.\n- \u00b7 assessing and challenging the appropriateness of the duration of the going concern review period to end of September 2024 and considering whether there are any known events or conditions that will occur in the short-term following the going concern period which would impact our considerations.\n- \u00b7 challenging the modelled scenarios, which included challenging the key assumptions used by management by comparing to corroborative evidence and searching out independent contradictory evidence. We assessed management's consideration of downside sensitivity analysis taking into account current events and market conditions. We have also challenged the impact of the historic impact on events such as covid-19 on the performance of the Group and the valuation of investment properties. We also applied further sensitivities on income and expense cash /flows and forecast valuation movements where appropriate to stress test the impact on both liquidity and covenants. As part of our sensitivity testing, we considered the perspective of our chartered surveyors on forecast valuation movements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We performed reverse stress testing on key assumptions and considered the likelihood of outcomes including controllable mitigating actions over and above the scenarios modelled.\n- \u00b7 further challenging the cash /flow forecasts with reference to historical trends and assessing the outcome of management's previous forecasts.\n- \u00b7 reviewing the disclosures in the /financial statements relating to going concern with a view to con/firming that they appropriately disclose the risk, the impact on the Group's operations and results and potential mitigating actions.\n\nThe results of the severe but plausible downside scenarios modelled by management indicate that the Group would maintain available facility and covenant headroom to be able to withstand the impact of plausible downside sensitivities throughout the period of the going concern assessment to 30 September 2024.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identi/fied any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast signi/ficant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 30 September 2024.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the /financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\nAudit scope\n\n- \u00b7 The Group operates in the United Kingdom through four segments: Central London, Major retail, Mixed-use urban and Subscale sectors.\n\nKey audit matters\n\nMateriality\n\n- \u00b7 We have identi/fied the entire Group as one component and perform full procedures across the entire Group.

Overall materiality is applied to account balances related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) and related loans and borrowings.\n- \u00b7 Speci/fic materiality of \u00a319m, which represents 5% of EPRA Earnings before tax. Speci/fic materiality is applied to account balances not related to any of the following balances; investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) and loans and borrowing.\n- \u00b7 Parent Company materiality of \u00a356m, which represents 0.9% of total assets in the Parent Company balance sheet.

We take into account size, risk pro/file, the organisation of the Group and e/ffectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential impact of climate change and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed.\n\n## Changes from the prior year\n\nIn the prior year, U and I Group Plc (U+I) was identi/fied as a separate component for the purpose of scoping the audit and designated a speci/fic scope. U+I has subsequently been integrated within the Group during the current /financial year and has not been identi/fied as a separate component for the purpose of our audit this year.\n\n## Climate change\n\nStakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact Land Securities Group PLC. The Group has determined that the most signi/ficant future impacts from climate change on their operations will be from failure to meet their 2030 carbon reduction target leading to regulatory, reputational and commercial impact and failure to mitigate physical impact on Landsec assets. These are explained in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 56 to 59 in the principal risks and uncertainties. They have also explained their climate commitments on pages 40 to 46. All of these disclosures form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited /financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on 'Other information'.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its /financial statements.\n\nThe Group has explained in the basis of preparation note within the /financial statements how they have re/flected the impact of climate change in their /financial statements including how this aligns with their commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. Signi/ficant judgements and estimates relating to climate change are included in note 2.\n\nOur audit e/ffort in considering the impact of climate change on the /financial statements was focused on evaluating management's assessment of the impact of climate risk, physical and transition, their climate commitments, the e/ffects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 56 to 59 and the signi/ficant judgements and estimates disclosed in note 2 and whether these have been appropriately re/flected in the valuation of the investment properties, investment properties held in joint ventures and trading properties or have any other material impact on the /financial statements. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the /financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. Where considerations of climate change were relevant to our assessment of going concern, these are described above.\n\nBased on our work we have not identi/fied the impact of climate change on the /financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact a key audit matter.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/ficance in our audit of the /financial statements of the current period and include the most signi/ficant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identi/fied. These matters included those which had the greatest e/ffect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the e/fforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the /financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nThe table below sets out the materiality, performance materiality and threshold for reporting audit di/fferences applied on our audit:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                      | Basis                                                                                             | Materiality         | Performance materiality   | Audit di/fferences   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n| Overall                                                                                                                                                              | 0.9% of total assets   (2022: 0.9% of total assets)                                               | \u00a399m  (2022: \u00a3110m) | \u00a374m  (2022: \u00a383m)        | \u00a35m  (2022: \u00a36m)     |\n| Speci/fic - account balances not related  to investment properties, trading  properties (either wholly owned or  held within joint ventures) or loans  and borrowing | 5% of EPRA earnings before tax   (2022: 5% of average revenue  pro/fit before tax over two years) | \u00a319m  (2022: \u00a318m)  | \u00a314m  (2022: \u00a313m)        | \u00a31m  (2022: \u00a31m)     |\n| Parent Company                                                                                                                                                       | 0.9% of total assets   (2022: 0.9% of total assets)                                               | \u00a356m  (2022: \u00a355m)  | \u00a342m  (2022: \u00a342m)        | \u00a33m  (2022: \u00a33m)     |\n\nWhen establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged would be material for the /financial statements as a whole. We determined that an asset-based measure would be the most appropriate basis for determining overall materiality given that key users of the Group's /financial statements are primarily focused on the valuation of the Group's assets. Based on this, we determined that it is appropriate to set the overall materiality at 0.9% of total assets (2022: 0.9% of total assets). We applied overall materiality to the investment property and trading property balances, including those in joint ventures, and other directly related balance sheet items such as the value of loans and borrowings which are secured against the Group's investment properties.\n\nThis provided a basis for determining the nature, timing and extent of risk assessment procedures, identifying and assessing the risk of material misstatement and determining the nature, timing and extent of further audit procedures.",

        "page_content": "## Independent Auditor's Report\n\n## continued\n\nWe determined that for other account balances not related to investment properties, trading properties (either wholly owned or held within joint ventures) or loans and borrowings, a misstatement of less than overall materiality for the /financial statements as a whole could in/fluence the economic decisions of users. We believe that it is most appropriate to use a pro/fit-based measure as pro/fit is also a focus of users of the /financial statements.\n\nWe determined that materiality for these areas should be based upon 5% of EPRA earnings before tax. EPRA earnings is considered an important performance metric and aligned with industry earnings measures.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality which has not resulted in a change from our planning materiality.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2022: 75%) of the respective materiality. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to our past experience of the audit that indicates a lower risk of misstatements, both corrected and uncorrected.\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identi/fied misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit di/fferences in excess of \u00a35m (2022: \u00a36m), as well as audit di/fferences in excess of \u00a31m (2022: \u00a31m) that relate to our speci/fic testing of the other account balances not related to investment properties or loans and borrowings, which are set at 5% of their respective planning materiality, as well as di/fferences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, including the Strategic Report and Governance section set out on pages 1-119, other than the /financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the /financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the /financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the /financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the /financial year for which the /financial statements are prepared is consistent with the /financial statements and those reports have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements;\n- \u00b7 the information about internal control and risk management systems in relation to /financial reporting processes and about share capital structures, given in compliance with rules 7.2.5 and 7.2.6 in the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules sourcebook made by the Financial Conduct Authority (the FCA Rules), is consistent with the /financial statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements; and\n- \u00b7 information about the Company's corporate governance statement and practices and about its administrative, management and supervisory bodies and their committees complies with rules 7.2.2, 7.2.3 and 7.2.7 of the FCA Rules.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/fluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these /financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.",

There are no signi/ficant industry speci/fic laws or regulations that we considered in determining our approach.\n- \u00b7 We understood how Land Securities Group PLC is complying with those frameworks by through enquiry with management, and by identifying the Group's policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We also identi/fied those members of management who have the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and for reporting any known instances of non-compliance to those charged with governance. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Board and the Audit Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group to either corroborate or provide contrary evidence which was then followed up. Our assessment included the tone from the top and the emphasis on a culture of honest and ethical behaviour.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's /financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by reviewing the Company's risk register and enquiry with management and the Audit Committee during the planning and execution phases of our audit. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identi/fied, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how management monitors those programmes and controls.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved:\n- -Enquiry of management, and when appropriate, those charged with governance regarding their knowledge of any non-compliance or potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that could a/ffect the /financial statements;\n- -Reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;\n- -Reading of internal audit reports;\n- -Obtaining electronic con/firmations from the Group's banking providers to vouch the existence of cash balances and completeness of loans, borrowings and other treasury positions such as derivatives;\n- -Obtaining and reading correspondence from legal and regulatory bodies, including the FRC and HMRC; and\n- -Journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding the business.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the /financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee we were appointed by the Company on 18 July 2013 to audit the /financial statements for the year ending 31 March 2014 and subsequent /financial periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 10 years, covering the years ending 31 March 2014 to 31 March 2023.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the /financial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## Section 1 - General\n\nThis section contains a description of the Group's signi/ficant accounting policies that relate to the /financial statements as a whole. A description of accounting policies speci/fic to individual areas (e.g. investment properties) is included within the relevant note to the /financial statements.\n\nThis section also includes a summary of new accounting standards, amendments and interpretations that have been applied in the year and those not yet adopted, and their actual or expected impact on the reported results of the Group.\n\n## 1 \u203a Basis of preparation and consolidation\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThese /financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards (IFRSs and IFRICs), and as regards the Parent Company /financial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The /financial statements have been prepared in Pounds Sterling (rounded to the nearest one million), which is the presentation currency of the Group (Land Securities Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings), and under the historical cost convention as modi/fied by the revaluation of investment property, /financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (without recycling), derivative /financial instruments and pension assets. As applied by the Group and the Company, there are no material di/fferences between UK adopted international accounting standards and EU IFRS.\n\nThe preparation of /financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the /financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may di/ffer from those estimates.\n\nLand Securities Group PLC (the Company) has not presented its own statement of comprehensive income (and separate income statement), as permitted by Section 408 of Companies Act 2006. The Merger reserve arose on 6 September 2002 when the Company acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the nominal value of the shares issued by the Company to acquire Land Securities PLC. The Merger reserve does not represent a realised or distributable pro/fit. Other reserves includes the Capital redemption reserve, which represents the nominal value of cancelled shares, the Share-based payment reserve and Own shares held by the Group.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe impact of international and domestic political and economic events over the course of the year has resulted in the UK facing a prolonged recessionary period and therefore the Directors have continued to place additional focus on the appropriateness of adopting the going concern assumption in preparing the /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023. The Group's going concern assessment considers changes in the Group's principal risks (see pages 56-59) and is dependent on a number of factors, including our /financial performance and continued access to borrowing facilities. Access to our borrowing facilities is dependent on our ability to continue to operate the Group's secured debt structure within its /financial covenants, which are described in note 22.\n\nIn order to satisfy themselves that the Group has adequate resources to continue as a going concern for the foreseeable future, the Directors have reviewed base case, downside and reverse stress test models, as well as a cash /flow model which considers the impact of pessimistic assumptions on the Group's operating environment (the 'mitigated downside scenario'). This mitigated downside scenario re/flects unfavourable macro-economic conditions, a deterioration in our ability to collect rent and service charge from our customers and removes uncommitted acquisitions, disposals and developments.\n\nThe Group's key metrics from the mitigated downside scenario as at the end of the going concern assessment period, which covers the 16 months to 30 September 2024, are shown below alongside the actual position at 31 March 2023.\n\n| Key metrics                   | 31 March 2023   | Mitigated downside  scenario 30 September 2024   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Security Group LTV            | 33.0%           | 39.2%                                            |\n| Adjusted net debt             | \u00a33,287m         | \u00a33,670m                                          |\n| EPRA net tangible assets      | \u00a36,967m         | \u00a36,021m                                          |\n| Available /financial headroom | \u00a32.4bn          | \u00a31.6bn                                           |\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the 0nancial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2023 continued\n\n## 1 \u203a Basis of preparation and consolidation continued\n\nIn our mitigated downside scenario, the Group has su/fficient cash reserves, with our Security Group LTV ratio remaining less than 65% and interest cover above 1.45x, for a period of at least 16 months from the date of authorisation of these /financial statements. The value of our assets would need to fall from 31 March 2023 values by approximately a further 50% for LTV to reach 65%. The Directors consider the likelihood of this occurring over the going concern assessment period to be remote.\n\nThe Security Group requires earnings of at least \u00a3150m in the year ending 31 March 2024 for interest cover to remain above 1.45x in the mitigated downside scenario, which would ensure compliance with the Group's covenant through to the end of the going concern assessment period. Security Group earnings are well above the level required to meet the interest cover covenant, and would need to fall from 31 March 2023 values by over \u00a3300m for interest cover to reach 1.45x. Therefore, the Directors do not anticipate a reduction in Security Group earnings over the period ending 30 September 2024 to a level that would result in a breach of the interest cover covenant.\n\nThe Directors have also considered a reverse stress-test scenario which assumes no further rent will be received, to determine when our available cash resources would be exhausted. Even under this extreme scenario, although breaching the interest cover covenant, the Group continues to have su/fficient cash reserves to continue in operation throughout the going concern assessment period.\n\nBased on these considerations, together with available market information and the Directors' knowledge and experience of the Group's property portfolio and markets, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparing these /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated /financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 incorporate the /financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings. Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Company. Control exists where an entity is exposed to variable returns and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the e/ffective date of acquisition or to the e/ffective date of disposal. Accounting policies of subsidiaries and joint ventures which di/ffer from Group accounting policies are adjusted on consolidation.\n\nWhere instruments in a subsidiary held by third parties are redeemable at the option of the holder, these interests are classi/fied as a /financial liability, called the redemption liability. The liability is carried at fair value; the value is reassessed at the balance sheet date and movements are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere equity in a subsidiary is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the shareholders of the parent, this is classi/fied as a non-controlling interest. Total comprehensive income or loss and the total equity of the Group are attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests according to their respective ownership percentages.\n\nJoint arrangements are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are equity accounted. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. A joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, have rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Joint operations are accounted for by including the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses on a line-by-line basis.\n\nIntra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated /financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture concerned. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The areas where the Group considers the judgements to be most signi/ficant involve assumptions or key estimates in respect of future events, where actual results may di/ffer from these estimates. These key estimates are deemed to have a signi/ficant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year. Other sources of estimation uncertainties identi/fied below are estimates deemed to have a lower risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /financial year.\n\n## Judgements\n\n- \u00b7 Recognising revenue where property management activities are performed by a third party (note 6)\n- \u00b7 Compliance with the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) taxation regime and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities (note 12)\n- \u00b7 Accounting for certain property acquisitions and disposals (note 14)\n\n## Key estimates\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation of investment properties (note 14)\n\n## Other sources of estimation uncertainties\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation of trading properties (note 15)\n- \u00b7 Impairment of trade receivables (note 27)\n\nIn preparing the /financial statements, the Group has considered the impact of climate change, taking into account the relevant disclosures in the Strategic Report, including those made in accordance with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate related Financial Disclosure. These considerations included the limited exposure in terms of our investment properties, as we fully costed and committed to invest \u00a3135m to achieve our science-based net zero target by 2030 (note this cost will /fluctuate year on year to account for changes in in/flation). On this basis, the Group has concluded that climate change did not have a material impact on the /financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the assessment that this is not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's going concern or viability assessment.\n\n## 3 \u203a Changes in accounting policies and standards\n\nThe accounting policies used in these /financial statements are consistent with those applied in the last annual /financial statements, as amended where relevant to re/flect the adoption of new standards, amendments and interpretations which became e/ffective in the year.\n\nFollowing clari/fication by IFRIC on the classi/fication of monies held in restricted accounts, monies that are restricted by use only are classi/fied at 31 March 2023 as 'Cash and cash equivalents', whereas monies to which access is restricted remain classi/fied as 'Monies held in restricted accounts and deposits'. The comparative balances have been restated where applicable to re/flect this change in classi/fication. As a result, \u00a318m of monies held in restricted accounts has been reclassi/fied to Cash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet as at 31 March 2022 which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from \u00a3128m to \u00a3146m and decreased the restricted accounts from \u00a322m to \u00a34m. Within the Group cash /flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2022, this reclassi/fication also resulted in the overall net movement in Cash and cash equivalent from \u00a3128m to \u00a3136m, as well as the movements in monies held in restricted accounts being classi/fied as cash /flows from investing activities rather than /financing activities as in prior year, based on the nature of the accounts. As at 1 April 2021, the total value of the reclassi/fication is \u00a310m which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from \u00a3nil to \u00a310m and decreased the restricted accounts from \u00a310m to \u00a3nil. This prior year restatement did not have any impact on the reported net assets, net current assets or net pro/fit or loss.\n\nAdditionally, \u00a32m of monies held in restricted accounts has been reclassi/fied to Cash and cash equivalents in the Company balance sheet as at 31 March 2022 which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from \u00a3nil to \u00a32m and decreased the restricted accounts from \u00a32m to \u00a3nil. Within the Company cash /flow statement for the year ended 31 March 2022, this reclassi/fication did not result in a net movement of Cash and cash equivalents. As at 1 April 2021, the total value of the reclassi/fication is \u00a33m which increased the Cash and cash equivalent from \u00a3nil to \u00a33m and decreased the restricted accounts from \u00a33m to \u00a3nil. This prior year restatement did not have any impact on the reported net assets, net current assets or net pro/fit or loss.\n\nThere has been no material impact on the /financial statements of adopting any other new standards, amendments and interpretations.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not yet e/ffective for the Group. The application of these new standards, amendments and interpretations are not expected to have a signi/ficant impact on the Group's income statement or balance sheet.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the  nancial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2023 continued\n\n## Section 2 - Performance\n\nThis section focuses on the performance of the Group for the year, including segmental information, earnings per share and net assets per share, together with further details on speci/fic components of the income statement and dividends paid.\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. Internally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these di/fferent forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.2bn, is an example of this approach, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. The Combined Portfolio comprises the investment properties of the Group's subsidiaries, on a proportionately consolidated basis when not wholly owned, together with our share of investment properties held in our joint ventures (see note 14). We consider this presentation provides further understanding to stakeholders of the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe same principle is applied to many of the other measures we discuss and, accordingly, a number of our /financial measures include the results of our joint ventures and subsidiaries on a proportionate basis. Measures that are described as being presented on a proportionate basis include the Group's share of joint ventures on a line-by-line basis and are adjusted to exclude the non-owned elements of our subsidiaries. This is in contrast to the Group's statutory /financial statements, where the Group's interest in joint ventures is presented as one line on the income statement and balance sheet, and all subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% with any non-owned element being adjusted as a non-controlling interest or redemption liability, as appropriate. Our joint operations are presented on a proportionate basis in all /financial measures.\n\nEPRA earnings is an alternative performance measure and is the Group's alternative measure of the underlying pre-tax pro/fit of the property rental business. EPRA earnings excludes all items of a capital nature, such as valuation movements and pro/fits and losses on the disposal of investment properties, as well as exceptional items. The Group believes that EPRA earnings provides additional understanding of the Group's operational performance to shareholders and other stakeholder groups. A full de/finition of EPRA earnings is given in the Glossary. The components of EPRA earnings are presented on a proportionate basis in note 4.\n\nOur income statement has two key components: the income we generate from leasing our investment properties net of associated costs (including interest expense), which we refer to as EPRA earnings, and items not directly related to the underlying rental business, principally valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of properties, re/financing activity and exceptional items, which we refer to as Capital and other items. Our income statement is presented in a columnar format, split into those items that relate to EPRA earnings and Capital and other items. The total column represents the Group's results presented in accordance with IFRS; the other columns provide additional information. We believe EPRA earnings provides further understanding of the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as it focuses on the rental income performance of the business and excludes Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year.\n\n## 4 \u203a Segmental information\n\nThe Group's operations are all in the UK and are managed across four operating segments, being Central London, Major retail destinations (Major retail), Mixed-use urban neighbourhoods (Mixed-use urban) and Subscale sectors.\n\nThe Central London segment includes all assets geographically located within central London. Major retail destinations includes all regional shopping centres and shops outside London and our outlets. The Mixed-use urban segment includes those assets where we see the most potential for capital investment. Subscale sectors mainly includes assets that will not be a focus for capital investment and consists of leisure and hotel assets and retail parks. There has been no change to the classi/fication of these segments during the year to 31 March 2023.\n\nManagement has determined the Group's operating segments based on the information reviewed by Senior Management to make strategic decisions. The chief operating decision maker is the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), comprising the Executive Directors and the Managing Directors. The information presented to ELT includes reports from all functions of the business as well as strategy, /financial planning, succession planning, organisational development and Group-wide policies.\n\nThe Group's primary measure of underlying pro/fit before tax is EPRA earnings. However, Segment net rental income is the lowest level to which the pro/fit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the four segments. The administrative costs, which are predominantly sta/ff costs for centralised functions, are all treated as administrative expenses and are not allocated to individual segments.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reallocation of the share of post-tax loss from joint ventures reported in the Group income statement to the individual line items reported in the segmental results table.\n- 2. Removal of the non-wholly owned share of results of the Group's subsidiaries. The non-wholly owned subsidiaries are consolidated at 100% in the Group's income statement, but only the Group's share is included in EPRA earnings reported in the segmental results table. The non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries are included in the 'Capital and other items' column presented in the Group's income statement, together with items not directly related to the underlying rental business such as investment properties valuation changes, pro/fits or losses on the disposal of investment properties, the proceeds from, and costs of, the sale of trading properties, income from and costs associated with development contracts, amortisation and impairment of intangibles, and other attributable costs, arising on business combinations.\n- 3. Included in the loss on disposal of investment properties is a \u00a39m charge related to the provision for /fire safety remediation works on properties no longer owned by the Group but for which the Group is responsible for remediating under the Building Safety Act 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Three of the Group's key /financial performance measures are EPRA earnings per share, EPRA Net Tangible Assets per share and total return on equity, which was previously referred to as total accounting return. There has been no change to the calculation of this measure other than the change of name during the year to 31 March 2023. Refer to Table 70 in the Business Analysis section for further details on these alternative performance measures.\n\nEPRA earnings, which is a tax adjusted measure of underlying earnings, is the basis for the calculation of EPRA earnings per share. We believe EPRA earnings and EPRA earnings per share provide further insight into the results of the Group's operational performance to stakeholders as they focus on the rental income performance of the business and exclude Capital and other items which can vary signi/ficantly from year to year.\n\n| Earnings per share                                        | Loss for  the year \u00a3m   | Year ended  31 March 2023 EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Pro/fit for  the year \u00a3m   | Year ended  31 March 2022 EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| (Loss)/pro/fit attributable to shareholders of the parent | (619)                   | (619)                                         | 869                        | 869                                           |\n| Valuation and loss/(pro/fit) on disposals                 | -                       | 1,016                                         | -                          | (527)                                         |\n| Net /finance income (excluded from EPRA earnings)         | -                       | (21)                                          | -                          | (1)                                           |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                    | -                       | 5                                             | -                          | 6                                             |\n| Other                                                     | -                       | 12                                            | -                          | 8                                             |\n| (Loss)/pro/fit used in per share calculation              | (619)                   | 393                                           | 869                        | 355                                           |\n|                                                           | IFRS                    | EPRA                                          | IFRS                       | EPRA                                          |\n| Basic (loss)/earnings per share                           | (83.6)p                 | 53.1p                                         | 117.4p                     | 48.0p                                         |\n| Diluted (loss)/earnings per share 1                       | (83.6)p                 | 53.1p                                         | 117.1p                     | 47.8p                                         |\n\n- 1.

Lease incentives being o/ffered to occupiers to enter into a lease, such as an initial rent-free period or a cash contribution to /fit out or similar costs, are an integral part of the net consideration for the use of the property and are therefore recognised on the same straight-line basis. Where the total consideration due under a lease is modi/fied, for example, where a concession is granted to a tenant prior to the date the conceded rent falls due, the revised total amount due under the lease is recognised on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease.\n\nContingent rents, being lease payments that are not /fixed at the inception of a lease, for example turnover rents, are variable consideration and are recorded as income in the year in which they are earned. Where a single payment is received from a tenant to cover both rent and service charge, the service charge component is separated and reported as service charge income.\n\nThe Group's revenue from contracts with customers, as de/fined in IFRS 15, includes service charge income, other property related income, trading property sales proceeds and development contract income.\n\nService charge income and management fees are recorded as income over time in the year in which the services are rendered. Revenue is recognised over time because the tenants bene/fit from the services as soon as they are rendered by the Group. The actual service provided during each reporting period is determined using cost incurred as the input method.\n\nOther property related income includes development and asset management fees. These fees are recognised over time, using time elapsed as the input method which measures the bene/fit simultaneously received and consumed by the customer, over the period the development or asset management services are provided.\n\nProceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised when control of the property transfers to the buyer, i.e. the buyer has the ability to direct the use of the property and the right to the cash in/flows and out/flows generated by it. This generally occurs on unconditional exchange or on completion. If completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange or if the Group has signi/ficant outstanding obligations between exchange and completion, the Group assesses whether there are multiple performance obligations in the contract and recognises revenue as each performance obligation is satis/fied.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Rentals received are accounted for as repayments of principal and /finance income as appropriate. Finance income is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining net investment in the /finance lease and is recognised within revenue.\n\nRevenue on development contracts is recognised over time over the period of the contract as the Group creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls. Progress towards completion of the development, by reference to the value of work completed using the costs incurred to date as a proportion of total costs expected to be incurred over the term of the contract is used as the input method.\n\n## Signi/ficant accounting judgement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor those properties where the property management activities are performed by a third party, the Group considers the third party to be the principal delivering the service. The key factors considered by the Group when making this judgement include the following responsibilities of the third party:\n\n- \u00b7 selecting suppliers and ensuring all services are delivered\n- \u00b7 establishing prices and seeking e/fficiencies\n- \u00b7 risk management and compliance\n\nIn addition, the residual rights residing with the Group are generally protective in nature.\n\nAll revenue is classi/fied within the 'EPRA earnings' column of the income statement, with the exception of proceeds from the sale of trading properties, income from development contracts and the non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries which are presented in the 'Capital and other items' column.\n\n|                                                           | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m   | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m   | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Rental income (excluding adjustment for lease incentives) | 606                 | 8                              | 614             | 552                 | 3                              | 555             |\n| Adjustment for lease incentives                           | (2)                 | -                              | (2)             | (18)                | -                              | (18)            |\n| Rental income                                             | 604                 | 8                              | 612             | 534                 | 3                              | 537             |\n| Service charge income                                     | 88                  | 3                              | 91              | 77                  | 1                              | 78              |\n| Trading property sales proceeds                           | -                   | 22                             | 22              | -                   | 27                             | 27              |\n| Other property related income                             | 29                  | -                              | 29              | 25                  | -                              | 25              |\n| Finance lease interest                                    | 2                   | -                              | 2               | 8                   | -                              | 8               |\n| Development contract income 1                             | -                   | 32                             | 32              | -                   | 1                              | 1               |\n| Other income                                              | 3                   | -                              | 3               | 3                   | -                              | 3               |\n| Revenue per the income statement                          | 726                 | 65                             | 791             | 647                 | 32                             | 679             |\n\n- 1.

If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The value in use is determined as the net present value of the future cash /flows expected to be derived from the asset, discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that re/flects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/fic to the asset. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount after the reversal does not exceed the amount that would have been determined, net of applicable depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nRents payable re/flect amounts due under head leases. Where rents payable are variable, and do not depend on an index or rate, the payments are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Where these rents are /fixed, or in-substance /fixed, at the inception of the agreement, or become /fixed or in-substance /fixed at some point over the life of the agreement, an asset representing the right to use the underlying land and a corresponding liability for the present value of the minimum future lease payments are recognised on the Group's balance sheet within Investment properties and borrowings respectively.\n\nAll costs are classi/fied within the 'EPRA earnings' column of the income statement, with the exception of the cost of sale of trading properties, costs arising on development contracts, amortisation and impairments of intangible assets, and other attributable costs, arising on business combinations and the non-owned element of the Group's subsidiaries which are presented in the 'Capital and other items' column.\n\n|                                                             | 2023              | 2023                         | 2023     | 2022              | 2022                         | 2022     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------|-------------------|------------------------------|----------|\n|                                                             | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | EPRA  earnings \u00a3m | Capital  and other  items \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m |\n| Rents payable                                               | 10                | -                            | 10       | 6                 | -                            | 6        |\n| Service charge expense                                      | 98                | 2                            | 100      | 88                | 2                            | 90       |\n| Direct property expenditure                                 | 98                | 2                            | 100      | 94                | -                            | 94       |\n| Administrative expenses                                     | 80                | -                            | 80       | 80                | -                            | 80       |\n| Impairment of trading properties                            | -                 | 19                           | 19       | -                 | 6                            | 6        |\n| Cost of trading property disposals                          | -                 | 21                           | 21       | -                 | 25                           | 25       |\n| Development contract expenditure 1                          | -                 | 41                           | 41       | -                 | 1                            | 1        |\n| Depreciation, including amortisation of software            | 5                 | 3                            | 8        | 5                 | -                            | 5        |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                      | -                 | 5                            | 5        | -                 | 6                            | 6        |\n| Business combination costs                                  | -                 | -                            | -        | -                 | 8                            | 8        |\n| Costs - other per the income statement                      | 291               | 93                           | 384      | 273               | 48                           | 321      |\n| Movement in bad and doubtful debts expense - rent           | (4)               | -                            | (4)      | (9)               | -                            | (9)      |\n| Movement in bad and doubtful debts expense - service charge | 2                 | -                            | 2        | (4)               | -                            | (4)      |\n| Total costs per the income statement                        | 289               | 93                           | 382      | 260               | 48                           | 308      |\n\n- 1.

The Board has recommended a /final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2023 of 12.0p per ordinary share (2022: 13.0p) to be paid as a PID. This /final dividend will result in a further estimated distribution of \u00a390m (2022: \u00a396m). Subject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting, the /final dividend will be paid on 21 July 2023 to shareholders registered at the close of business on 16 June 2023.\n\nThe total dividend paid and recommended in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023 is 38.6p per ordinary share (2022: 37.0p) resulting in a total estimated distribution of \u00a3288m (2022: \u00a3274m).\n\nThe /first quarterly dividend for the year ending 31 March 2024 will be paid in October 2023 and will be announced in due course.\n\nA Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) has been available in respect of all dividends paid during the year. The last day for DRIP elections for the /final dividend is close of business on 30 June 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12 \u203a Income tax\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncome tax on the pro/fit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method on temporary di/fferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for /financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the asset is realised, or the liability is settled.\n\nNo provision is made for temporary di/fferences (i) arising on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities, other than on a business combination, that a/ffect neither accounting nor taxable pro/fit and (ii) relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## S Signi/ficant accounting judgement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). As a result, the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on its pro/fits and gains from the qualifying rental business in the UK. Non-qualifying pro/fits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal. In order to maintain group REIT status, certain ongoing criteria must be met. The main criteria are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at the start of each accounting period, the assets of the tax exempt business must be at least 75% of the total value of the Group's assets;\n- \u00b7 at least 75% of the Group's total pro/fits must arise from the tax exempt business; and\n- \u00b7 at least 90% of the notional taxable pro/fit of the property rental business must be distributed.\n\nThe Directors intend that the Group should continue as a REIT for the foreseeable future, with the result that deferred tax is no longer recognised on temporary di/fferences relating to the property rental business.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts, if any, to be recognised. In particular, judgement is required when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised, taking into account the expected timing and level of future taxable income. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when management believes it is probable that future taxable pro/fits will be available against which the deductible temporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nThere is no income tax charge in the income statement (2022: none). There is a deferred tax credit of \u00a33m (2022: \u00a35m charge) included within Other comprehensive income.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It includes details of investment properties, investments in joint ventures and trading properties.\n\nOur property portfolio is a combination of properties that are wholly owned by the Group, part owned through joint arrangements and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest. In the Group's IFRS balance sheet, wholly owned properties and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest are presented as either 'Investment properties' or 'Trading properties'. The Group applies equity accounting to its investments in joint ventures, which requires the Group's share of properties held by joint ventures to be presented within 'Investments in joint ventures'.\n\nInternally, management review the results of the Group on a basis that adjusts for these forms of ownership to present a proportionate share. The Combined Portfolio, with assets totalling \u00a310.2bn , is an example of this proportionate share, re/flecting the economic interest we have in our properties regardless of our ownership structure. We consider this presentation provides further insight to stakeholders about the activities and performance of the Group, as it aggregates the results of all of the Group's property interests which under IFRS are required to be presented across a number of line items in the statutory /financial statements.\n\nThe Group's investment properties are carried at fair value and trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Both of these values are determined by the Group's external valuers. The combined value of the Group's total investment property portfolio (including the Group's share of investment properties held through joint ventures) is shown as a reconciliation in note 14.\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investment properties\n\nInvestment properties are properties, either owned or leased by the Group, that are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation, or both. Investment properties are measured initially at cost including related transaction costs, and subsequently at fair value. Fair value is based on market value, as determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. The di/fference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount prior to re-measurement is included in the income statement as a valuation surplus or de/ficit. Investment properties are presented on the balance sheet within non-current assets.\n\nSome of the Group's investment properties are owned through long-leasehold arrangements, as opposed to the Group owning the freehold. Where the Group is a lessee, a right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of the lease and accounted for as investment property. Initially, the cost of investment properties held under leases includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. The investment properties held under leases are subsequently carried at their fair value. A corresponding liability is recorded within borrowings. Each lease payment is allocated between repayment of the liability and a /finance charge to achieve a constant interest rate on the outstanding liability.\n\n## Trading properties\n\nTrading properties are those properties held for sale, or those being developed with a view to sell. Trading properties are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The net realisable value of a trading property is determined by a professional external valuer at each reporting date. If the net realisable value of a trading property is lower than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement. If, in subsequent periods, the net realisable value of a trading property that was previously impaired increases above its carrying value, the impairment is reversed to align the carrying value of the property with the net realisable value. Trading properties are presented on the balance sheet within current assets.\n\n## Acquisition of properties\n\nProperties are treated as acquired when the Group assumes control of the property.\n\n## Capital expenditure and capitalisation of borrowing costs\n\nCapital expenditure on properties consists of costs of a capital nature, including costs associated with developments and refurbishments. Where a property is being developed or undergoing major refurbishment, interest costs associated with direct expenditure on the property are capitalised. The interest capitalised is calculated using the Group's weighted average cost of borrowings. Interest is capitalised from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion. Certain internal sta/ff and associated costs directly attributable to the management of major schemes are also capitalised. The total sta/ff and associated costs are capitalised based on the proportion of time spent on the relevant scheme. Internal sta/ff costs are capitalised from the date the Group determines it is probable that the development will progress until the date of practical completion.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the  nancial statements\n\nfor the year ended 31 March 2023 continued\n\n## Transfers between investment properties and trading properties\n\nWhen the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property for continued future use as an investment property, the property continues to be held as an investment property. When the Group begins to redevelop an existing investment property with a view to sell, the property is transferred to trading properties and held as a current asset. The property is re-measured to fair value as at the date of the transfer with any gain or loss being taken to the income statement. The re-measured amount becomes the deemed cost at which the property is then carried in trading properties.\n\n## Disposal of properties\n\nProperties are treated as disposed when control of the property is transferred to the buyer. Typically, this will either occur on unconditional exchange or on completion. Where completion is expected to occur signi/ficantly after exchange, or where the Group continues to have signi/ficant outstanding obligations after exchange, the control will not usually transfer to the buyer until completion.\n\nThe pro/fit on disposal is determined as the di/fference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the beginning of the accounting period plus capital expenditure to the date of disposal. The pro/fit on disposal of investment properties is presented separately on the face of the income statement. Proceeds received on the sale of trading properties are recognised within Revenue, and the carrying value at the date of disposal is recognised within Costs.\n\nSigni/ficant accounting judgement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Acquisition and disposal of properties\n\nProperty transactions can be complex in nature and material to the /financial statements. To determine when an acquisition or disposal should be recognised, management consider whether the Group assumes or relinquishes control of the property, and the point at which this is obtained or relinquished. Consideration is given to the terms of the acquisition or disposal contracts and any conditions that must be satis/fied before the contract is ful/filled. In the case of an acquisition, management must also consider whether the transaction represents an asset acquisition or business combination.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and other sources of estimation uncertainty\n\n## Valuation of the Group's properties\n\nThe valuation of the Group's property portfolio has been undertaken by independent valuers in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation - Global Standards and UK Supplement (together the 'Red Book'). Real estate by its nature is a complex asset class with value determined by a range of factors overlaid by interpretation and judgemental assessment of market data; as such it is classi/fied as a 'Level 3 asset' within IFRS. Factors a/ffecting valuation are on an individual property level and include the property type, location, tenure and tenancy characteristics, quality of the asset and prospects for future rental revenue.\n\nThe Group's investment property valuation has been undertaken by valuers interpreting market evidence as available in reaching their conclusions on fair value, re/flecting asset speci/fic data provided by management, making assumptions that tenure, tenancies, town planning and condition of buildings are as provided. As a result, the valuations the Group places on its property portfolio are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, particularly in periods of volatility or low transaction volume in the property market.\n\nThe estimation of the net realisable value of the Group's trading properties, in particular the development land and infrastructure programmes, is inherently subjective due to a number of factors, including their complexity, unusually large size, the substantial expenditure required and long timescales to completion. In addition, as a result of these timescales to completion, the plans associated with these programmes could be subject to signi/ficant market variation over the course of development. As a result, and similar to the valuation of investment properties, the net realisable values of the Group's trading properties are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are determined on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate.\n\nIf the assumptions upon which the external valuer has based its valuations prove to be inaccurate, this may have an impact on the value of the Group's investment and trading properties, which could in turn have an e/ffect on the Group's /financial position and results.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The average rate of interest capitalisation for the year is 3.0% (2022: 2.5%). The gross historical cost of investment properties is \u00a38,280m (2022: \u00a38,604m).\n\n## Valuation process\n\nThe fair value of investment properties at 31 March 2023 was determined by the Group's external valuers, CBRE and JLL. The valuations are in accordance with RICS standards and were arrived at by reference to market evidence of transactions for similar properties. The valuations performed by the valuers are reviewed internally by Senior Management and other relevant people within the business. This process includes discussions of the assumptions used by the valuers, as well as a review of the resulting valuations. Discussions of the valuation process and results are held between Senior Management, the Audit Committee and the valuers on a half-yearly basis.",

The fair value of investment properties is determined using the income capitalisation approach. Under this approach, forecast net cash /flows, based upon current market derived estimated rental values (market rents) together with estimated costs, are discounted at market derived capitalisation rates to produce the valuers' opinion of fair value. The average discount rate, which, if applied to all cash /flows would produce the fair value, is described as the equivalent yield.\n\nProperties in the development programme are typically valued using a residual valuation method. Under this methodology, the valuer assesses the completed development value using income and yield assumptions. Deductions are then made for estimated costs to complete, including /finance and developer's pro/fit, to arrive at the valuation. Costs include future estimated costs associated with refurbishment or development (excluding /finance costs), together with an estimate of cash incentives to be paid to tenants. As the development approaches completion, the valuer may consider the income capitalisation approach to be more appropriate.\n\nThe Group considers all of its investment properties to fall within 'Level 3', as de/fined by IFRS 13 and as explained in note 26(iii). Accordingly, there have been no transfers of properties within the fair value hierarchy in the /financial year.\n\nThe table below summarises the key unobservable inputs used in the valuation of the Group's wholly owned investment properties, and properties owned by the Group but where a third party holds a non-controlling interest, at 31 March 2023:\n\n|                                              | Market  value   | Estimated rental value \u00a3 per sq ft   | Estimated rental value \u00a3 per sq ft   | Estimated rental value \u00a3 per sq ft   | Equivalent yield %   | Equivalent yield %   | Equivalent yield %   |     |           | Costs \u00a3 per sq ft   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----|-----------|---------------------|\n|                                              | \u00a3m              | Low                                  | Average                              | High                                 | Low                  | Average              | High                 | Low | Average 1 | High                |\n| Central London                               |                 |                                      |                                      |                                      |                      |                      |                      |     |           |                     |\n| West End o/ffices                            | 2,288           | 20                                   | 64                                   | 156                                  | 4.0%                 | 4.3%                 | 5.6%                 | -

Interests in joint arrangements are accounted for as either a joint venture or a joint operation. The treatment as either a joint venture or a joint operation will depend on whether the Group has rights to the net assets, or a direct interest in the assets and liabilities of the arrangement.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture when the Group, along with the other parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The equity method requires the Group's share of the joint venture's post-tax pro/fit or loss for the year to be presented separately in the income statement and the Group's share of the joint venture's net assets to be presented separately in the balance sheet. Where a joint venture is in a net liability position, the Group's share of accumulated losses of a joint venture interest are recognised as net liabilities where there is an obligation to provide for these losses.\n\nA joint arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation when the Group, along with the parties that have joint control of the arrangement, has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group's share of jointly controlled assets, related liabilities, income and expenses are combined with the equivalent items in the /financial statements on a line-by-line basis.\n\nThe Group's principal joint arrangements are described below:\n\n| Joint ventures 1                             | Percentage owned  & voting rights 2   | Business segment                | Year end date 3   | Joint venture partner                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Held at 31 March 2023 4,5                    |                                       |                                 |                   |                                                                                     |\n| Nova, Victoria 6                             | 50%                                   | Central London                  | 31 March          | Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust                                                 |\n| Southside Limited Partnership                | 50%                                   | Major retail                    | 31 March          | Invesco Real Estate European Fund                                                   |\n| Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership | 50%                                   | Major retail,  Subscale sectors | 31 March          | The Crown Estate Commissioners                                                      |\n| Harvest 7,9                                  | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                | 31 March          | J Sainsbury plc                                                                     |\n| The Ebbs/fleet Limited Partnership 9         | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                | 31 March          | Ebbs/fleet Property Limited                                                         |\n| West India Quay Unit Trust 9                 | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                | 31 March          | Schroder UK Real Estate Fund                                                        |\n| May/field 8,9                                | 50%                                   | Mixed-use urban                 | 31 March          | LCR Limited, Manchester City Council,  Transport for Greater Manchester             |\n| Curzon Park Limited 9                        | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                | 31 March          | Derwent Developments (Curzon)  Limited                                              |\n| Plus X Holdings Limited 9                    | 50%                                   | Subscale sectors                | 31 March          | Paul David Rostas, Matthew Edmund  Hunter                                           |\n| Landmark Court Partnership Limited 9         | 51%                                   | Central London                  | 31 March          | TTL Landmark Court Properties Limited                                               |\n| Joint operation                              | Ownership interest                    | Business segment                | Year end date 3   | Joint operation partners                                                            |\n| Held at 31 March 2023                        |                                       |                                 |                   |                                                                                     |\n| Bluewater, Kent                              | 48.75%                                | Major retail                    | 31 March          | M&G Real Estate and GIC Royal London Asset Management Aberdeen Standard Investments |\n\n- 1. Refer to Additional information pages 205-209 for the full list of the Group's related undertakings.\n- 2. Investments under joint arrangements are not always represented by an equal percentage holding by each partner. In a number of joint ventures that are not considered principal joint ventures and therefore not included in the table above, the Group holds a majority shareholding but has joint control and therefore the arrangement is accounted for as a joint venture.\n- 3. The year end date shown is the accounting reference date of the joint arrangement. In all cases, the Group's accounting is performed using /financial information for the Group's own reporting year and reporting date.\n- 4. During the year to 31 March 2023, Wind Farms are no longer classi/fied as a joint venture and are consolidated together with other subsidiary undertakings. Wind Farms includes DS Renewables LLP, Hendy Wind Farm Limited and Rhoscrowther Wind Farm Limited.\n- 5. On 24 March 2023 the Group acquired the remaining 50% interest in St David's Limited Partnership. From that date, the results of the operations from St David's are consolidated together with other subsidiary undertakings. Results from its operations prior to that date are included as share of pro/fit or loss from joint ventures. For further details on the acquisition refer to note 14.\n- 6. Nova, Victoria includes the Nova Limited Partnership, Nova Residential Limited Partnership, Nova GP Limited, Nova Business Manager Limited, Nova Residential (GP) Limited, Nova Residential Intermediate Limited, Nova Estate Management Company Limited, Nova Nominee 1 Limited and Nova Nominee 2 Limited.\n- 7.

The fair value at the date of acquisition was \u00a330m and the asset is being amortised over a period of 20 years. On recognition of the intangible asset, the Group recognised a deferred tax liability of \u00a36m, and corresponding goodwill of the same amount. The deferred tax liability is being released to the income statement as the intangible asset is amortised or impaired, and the corresponding element of the goodwill is being tested for impairment.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2023, the intangible asset has been impaired by \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil). The recoverable amount of the intangible asset has been based on its value in use, using a discount rate of 7.0% (2022: 4.0%).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio (gearing) and loan-to-value ratio (LTV) to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders while maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing /financial and operating market cycles. The table in note 21 details a number of the Group's key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.\n\nA key element of the Group's capital structure is that the majority of our borrowings are secured against a large pool of our assets (the Security Group). This enables us to raise long-term debt in the bond market, as well as shorter-term /flexible bank facilities, both at competitive rates. In general, we follow a secured debt strategy as we believe this gives the Group better access to borrowings at a lower cost.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds a number of assets outside the Security Group structure (in the Non-restricted Group). By having both the Security Group and the Non-restricted Group, and considerable /flexibility to move assets between the two, we are able to raise the most appropriate /finance for each speci/fic asset or joint venture.\n\n## 21 \u203a Capital structure\n\n|                                                    | Group \u00a3m   | Joint  ventures \u00a3m   | Adjustment  for  non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries \u00a3m   | 2023 Combined \u00a3m   | Group \u00a3m   | Joint  ventures \u00a3m   | Adjustment  for non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries \u00a3m   | 2022 3 Combined \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Property portfolio                                 |            |                      |                                                       |                    |            |                      |                                                      |                      |\n| Market value of investment properties              | 9,743      | 635                  | (139)                                                 | 10,239             | 11,362     | 800                  | (145)                                                | 12,017               |\n| Trading properties and long-term contracts         | 118        | -

EPRA LTV is a new measure introduced by EPRA in the current year. The EPRA measure di/ffers from the Group LTV as it includes net payables and receivables, and includes trading properties at fair value and debt instruments at nominal value rather than book value. EPRA LTV was not presented in the /financial statements as at 31 March 2022 as the measure had not yet been introduced. EPRA LTV would have been presented as 35.5% at 31 March 2022.\n- 2. The weighted average cost of debt is calculated based on historical average rates of gross debt for the period. The weighted average cost of debt as at 31 March 2022 has been restated to re/flect average rates of gross debt for the period, rather than average rates of net debt used in the calculation in previous periods.\n- 3. Cash and cash equivalents and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits have been restated as at 31 March 2022 following a clari/fication by IFRIC on classi/fication of funds with externally imposed restrictions. There was no impact on computed net debt, adjusted net debt, gearing, adjusted gearing, Group LTV and Security Group LTV.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any di/fference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the e/ffective interest method.\n\nWhen debt re/financing exercises are carried out, existing liabilities will be treated as being extinguished when the new liability is substantially di/fferent from the existing liability. In making this assessment, the Group will consider the transaction as a whole, taking into account both qualitative and quantitative characteristics.\n\n|

The Security Group includes investment properties, development properties, the X-Leisure fund, and the Group's investment in Westgate Oxford Alliance Limited Partnership, Nova, Victoria and Southside Limited Partnership, in total valued at \u00a39.6bn at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: \u00a311.2bn). The secured debt structure has a tiered operating covenant regime which gives the Group substantial /flexibility when the loan-to-value and interest cover in the Security Group are less than 65% and more than 1.45x respectively. If these limits are exceeded, the operating environment becomes more restrictive with provisions to encourage a reduction in gearing. The interest rate of each MTN is /fixed until the expected maturity, being two years before the legal maturity date of the MTN. The interest rate for the last two years may either become /floating on a SONIA basis plus an increased margin (relative to that at the time of issue), or subject to a /fixed coupon uplift, depending on the terms and conditions of the speci/fic notes.\n\nThe e/ffective interest rate is based on the coupon paid and includes the amortisation of issue costs. The MTNs are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange and their fair values are based on their respective market prices.\n\nDuring the year, the Group did not purchase any MTNs (2022: none).\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the Group's committed facilities totalled \u00a33,007m (31 March 2022: \u00a33,022m).\n\n| Syndicated and bilateral bank debt   |                                | Authorised   | Authorised   | Drawn   | Drawn   | Undrawn   | Undrawn   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                      | Maturity as  at 31 March  2023 | 2023 \u00a3m      | 2022 \u00a3m      | 2023 \u00a3m | 2022 \u00a3m | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n| Syndicated debt                      | 2022                           | -            | 12           | -       | 12      | -         | -         |\n| Syndicated debt                      | 2024-27                        | 2,782        | 2,785        | 383     | 1,393   | 2,399     | 1,392     |\n| Bilateral debt                       | 2026                           | 225          | 225          | -       | 155     | 225       | 70        |\n|                                      |                                | 3,007        | 3,022        | 383     | 1,560   | 2,624     | 1,462     |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair value of interest-rate and foreign exchange swaps is based on counterparty or market quotes. Those quotes are tested for reasonableness by discounting estimated future cash /flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market rates for similar instruments at the measurement date.

This note provides further detail on /financial risk management and includes quantitative information on speci/fic /financial risks.\n\nThe Group is exposed to a variety of /financial risks: market risks (principally interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group's overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse e/ffects of these on the Group's /financial performance and includes the use of derivative /financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.\n\nFinancial risk management is carried out by the Group's treasury function under policies approved by the Board of Directors, except where the relevant arrangements have been put in place by an individual subsidiary or a joint venture level prior to acquisition.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it intends to hold its /financial assets to collect the contractual cash /flows, or whether it intends to sell them before maturity and classi/fies its /financial instruments into the appropriate categories. The following table summarises the Group's /financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures:\n\n|                                                             | 2023 \u00a3m   | Group 2022 1 \u00a3m   | 2023 \u00a3m   | Company 2022 1 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|\n| Financial assets at amortised cost                          | 450       | 570               | -         | -                   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                   | 41        | 146               | 2         | 2                   |\n| Financial liabilities at amortised cost                     | (3,750)   | (4,777)           | (2,821)   | (2,912)             |\n| Financial instruments at fair value through pro/fit or loss | 38        | 26                | -         | -                   |\n|                                                             | (3,221)   | (4,035)           | (2,819)   | (2,910)             |\n\n- 1. Cash and cash equivalents and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits, and the impacted categories in the table above, have been restated as at 31 March 2022 following a clari/fication by IFRIC on classi/fication of funds with externally imposed restrictions.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (i) Credit risk\n\nThe Group's principal /financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, net investment in /finance leases and amounts due from joint ventures. Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that speci/fically relates to each type of asset.\n\n## Bank and /financial institutions\n\nThe principal credit risks of the Group arise from /financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and /financial institutions. In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit, only independently rated banks and /financial institutions with a minimum rating of A- are accepted. For UK banks and /financial institutions with which the Group has a committed lending relationship, the minimum rating is lowered to BBB+. The Group's treasury function currently performs regular reviews of the credit ratings of all /financial institution counterparties. Furthermore, the treasury function ensures that funds deposited with a single /financial institution remain within the Group's policy limits.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables. The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. In determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements, likely deferrals of payments due, agreed rent concessions and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our customers operate. These assessments are made on a customer by customer basis.\n\nTo limit the Group's exposure to credit risk on trade receivables, a credit report is usually obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty. This report, alongside the Group's internal assessment of credit risk, is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required, if any, from the tenant at inception. In general, these deposits represent between three and six months' rent.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cash and cash equivalents and monies held in restricted accounts and deposits, and the impacted categories, have been restated as at 31 March 2022 following a clari/fication by IFRIC on classi/fication of funds with externally imposed restrictions.\n\nThe Group's core /financing structure is in the Security Group, although the Non-restricted Group may also secure independent funding.\n\n## Security Group\n\nThe Group's principal /financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets (the Security Group) that comprises the majority of the Group's investment property portfolio and certain investments in joint ventures. These arrangements operate in 'tiers' determined by LTV and interest cover ratio (ICR). This structure is most /flexible at lower tiers (with a lower LTV and a higher ICR) and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom. In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive. No /financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 33.0% (2022: 36.4%), meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and bene/fited from maximum operational /flexibility.\n\nManagement monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis or semi-annual basis, depending on the covenant, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.\n\n## Non-restricted Group\n\nThe Non-restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt. Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-restricted Group and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Due to a combination of factors, including the degree of certainty required under IFRS 9 Financial instruments, the Group does not apply hedge accounting to hedging instruments used in this context. Speci/fic interest-rate hedges are also used from time to time to /fix the interest rate exposure on our debt. Where speci/fic hedges are used to /fix the interest exposure on /floating rate debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the Group (including the Group's share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) had pay-/fixed and receive/floating interest-rate swaps in place with a nominal value of \u00a3619m (2022: \u00a3619m) and forward starting pay-/fixed interest-rate swaps of \u00a3940m (2022: \u00a3275m). The Group's net debt (including the Group's share of joint ventures and non-wholly owned subsidiaries) was 100.6% /fixed (2022: 70.0%) and based on the Group's debt balances at 31 March 2023, a 1% increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/ (decrease) the annual net /finance expense in the income statement and reduce/(increase) equity by \u00a31m (2022: \u00a39m). The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the /floating rate components of borrowings, interest rate swaps as well as cash and cash equivalents.",

The vast majority of the Group's foreign currency transactions relate to foreign currency borrowing under the Group's commercial paper programme. It is the Group's policy to hedge 100% of this exposure. At 31 March 2023, the Group had issued \u20ac190m (2022: \u20ac255m) and $180m (2022: $185m) of commercial paper, fully hedged through foreign exchange swaps. A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil) impact in the income statement and equity arising from foreign currency borrowings.\n\nWhere additional foreign exchange risk is identi/fied (not linked to commercial paper borrowing), it is the Group's policy to assess the likelihood of the risk crystallising and if deemed appropriate use derivatives to hedge some or all of the risk. At 31 March 2023, the Group had no foreign currency exposures being managed using foreign currency derivative contracts (2022: \u20ac6m exposure, which were entered into in order to economically hedge our exposure to movements in foreign currencies). A 10% weakening or strengthening of Sterling would therefore have no impact on the pro/fit before tax and/or total equity (2022: \u00a31m impact).\n\n## Financial maturity analysis\n\nThe interest rate pro/file of the Group's borrowings is set out below (based on notional values):\n\n|           | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   |   Floating  rate \u00a3m | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   | Floating   rate \u00a3m   | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| Sterling  | 2,863             |                 383 | 3,246           | 2,479             | 1,700                | 4,179           |\n| Euro      | -                 |                 167 | 167             | 30                | 217                  | 247             |\n| US Dollar | -                 |                 145 | 145             | -                 | 142                  | 142             |\n|           | 2,863             |                 695 | 3,558           | 2,509             | 2,059                | 4,568           |\n\nThe expected maturity pro/files of the Group's borrowings are as follows (based on notional values):\n\n|                                                   | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   | Floating  rate \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   | Fixed   rate \u00a3m   | Floating   rate \u00a3m   | 2022 Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| One year or less, or on demand                    | 427               | 312                 | 739             | 30                | 511                  | 541             |\n| More than one year but not more than two years    | 87                | 292                 | 379             | 427               | 2                    | 429             |\n| More than two years but not more than /five years | 415               | 91                  | 506             | 437               | 1,546                | 1,983           |\n| More than /five years                             | 1,934             | -                   | 1,934           | 1,615             | -                    | 1,615           |\n| Borrowings                                        | 2,863             | 695                 | 3,558           | 2,509             | 2,059                | 4,568           |\n| E/ffect of hedging                                | 619               | (619)               | -               | 400               | (400)                | -               |\n| Borrowings net of interest-rate swaps             | 3,482             | 76                  | 3,558           | 2,909             | 1,659                | 4,568           |\n\nThe expected maturity pro/files of the Group's derivative instruments are as follows (based on notional values):\n\n|                                                   | Foreign  exchange  swaps \u00a3m   | 2023 Interest- rate  swaps \u00a3m   | Foreign  exchange  swaps \u00a3m   | 2022 Interest- rate swaps \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| One year or less, on demand                       | 319                           | 400                             | 360                           | -                              |\n| More than one year but not more than two years    | -                             | 494                             | -                             | 400                            |\n| More than two years but not more than /five years | -                             | 665                             | -                             | 494                            |\n| More than /five years                             | -                             | -                               | -                             | -                              |\n|                                                   | 319                           | 1,559                           | 360                           | 894                            |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The fair value of the Group's net investment in tenant /finance leases, calculated by the Group's external valuer by applying a weighted average equivalent yield of 7.9% (31 March 2022: 4.9%), is \u00a316m (31 March 2022: \u00a366m).\n\nThe fair values of any /floating rate /financial liabilities are assumed to be equal to their nominal value. The fair values of the MTNs fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, the syndicated and bilateral facilities, commercial paper, interest-rate swaps and foreign exchange swaps fall within Level 2, and the amounts payable and receivable under leases fall within Level 3.\n\nThe fair values of the /financial instruments have been determined by reference to relevant market prices, where available. The fair values of the Group's outstanding interest-rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash /flows, using appropriate market discount rates. These valuation techniques fall within Level 2.\n\nThe fair value of the other investments is calculated by reference to the net assets of the underlying entity. The valuation is not based on observable market data and therefore the other investments are considered to fall within Level 3.",

The Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its trade receivables. A provision for impairment is made for the lifetime expected credit losses on initial recognition of the receivable. If collection is expected in more than one year, the balance is presented within non-current assets.\n\nIn determining the expected credit losses the Group takes into account any recent payment behaviours and future expectations of likely default events (i.e. not making payment on the due date) based on individual customer credit ratings, actual or expected insolvency /filings or company voluntary arrangements and market expectations and trends in the wider macro-economic environment in which our customers operate. Where a concession is agreed with a customer after the due date for the rent, this amount is recognised as an impairment of the related trade receivable.\n\nTrade and other receivables are written o/ff once all avenues to recover the balances are exhausted and the lease has ended. Receivables written o/ff are no longer subject to any enforcement activity.\n\n## Source of estimation uncertainty\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impairment of trade receivables\n\nThe Group's assessment of expected credit losses is inherently subjective due to the forward-looking nature of the assessments. As a result, the value of the provisions for impairment of the Group's trade receivables are subject to a degree of uncertainty and are made on the basis of assumptions which may not prove to be accurate. See note 26 for further details of the Group's assessment of the credit risk associated with trade receivables.\n\n|                                                            | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net trade receivables                                      | 47        | 38        |\n| Tenant lease incentives (note 14)                          | 175       | 212       |\n| Prepayments                                                | 46        | 34        |\n| Accrued income                                             | 11        | 11        |\n| Amounts due from joint ventures and associates             | 39        | 15        |\n| Deferred consideration                                     | 17        | -         |\n| Other receivables                                          | 30        | 58        |\n| Total current trade and other receivables                  | 365       | 368       |\n| Non-current amounts due from joint ventures and associates | 142       | 147       |\n| Non-current property sales receivables                     | -         | 5         |\n| Deferred consideration                                     | 4         | 18        |\n| Other non-current receivables                              | -         | 7         |\n| Total trade and other receivables                          | 511       | 545       |\n\nThe accounting for lease incentives is set out in note 6.

The scheme assets are measured at fair value, except annuities which are valued to match the liability or bene/fit value. The operating and /financing costs of the scheme are recognised separately in the income statement. Service costs are spread using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they are identi/fied. Net /financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise, calculated with reference to the discount rate, and are included in /finance income or expense on a net basis. Re-measurement gains and losses arising from either experience di/ffering from previous actuarial assumptions, or changes to those assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.\n\n## De/fined contribution schemes\n\nThe charge to operating pro/fit for the year in respect of de/fined contribution schemes was \u00a33m (2022: \u00a33m).\n\n## De/fined bene/fit scheme\n\nThe Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies (the Scheme) is a registered de/fined bene/fit /final salary scheme subject to the UK regulatory framework for pensions, including the Scheme Speci/fic Funding requirements. The Scheme is operated under trust and as such, the Trustees of the Scheme are responsible for operating the Scheme and they have a statutory responsibility to act in accordance with the Scheme's Trust Deed and Rules, in the best interest of the bene/ficiaries of the Scheme and UK legislation (including trust law). The Trustees and the Group have the joint power to set the contributions that are paid to the Scheme.\n\nIn setting contributions to the Scheme, the Trustees and the Group are guided by the advice of a quali/fied independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method. The Scheme is closed to new members (and was closed to future accrual on 31 October 2019). A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2021 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson LLP. This valuation was updated to 31 March 2023 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19 Employee Bene/fits. The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2024.\n\nThere have been no employer or employee contributions following the closure of the Scheme to future accrual on 31 October 2019. Prior to this, the employer contribution rate was 43.1% of pensionable salary to cover the costs of accruing bene/fits and the employee contributions were at 8% of monthly pensionable salary. It was also agreed that no further de/ficit contributions were required from the Group. Employee contributions were paid by salary sacri/fice, and therefore appeared as Group contributions. The Group does not expect to make any employee or employer contributions to the Scheme in the year to 31 March 2024 (2023: \u00a3nil).\n\nAll death-in-service and incapacity bene/fits arising during employment are wholly insured. No post-retirement bene/fits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This insurance contract is valued as an asset using the same IAS 19 assumptions. Insurance contracts are annuities which are unquoted assets. All other Scheme assets have quoted prices in active markets. The Scheme assets do not include any directly owned /financial instruments issued by the Group. Indirectly owned /financial instruments had a fair value of \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\nIn the most recent triennial valuation, the de/fined bene/fit scheme liabilities were split nil% (2022: nil%) in respect of active scheme participants, 26% (2022: 31%) in respect of deferred scheme participants, and 74% (2022: 69%) in respect of retirees. As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there are no longer any active scheme participants. The weighted average duration of the de/fined bene/fit scheme liabilities at 31 March 2023 is 12.0 years (2022: 14.6 years).",

In December 2022, the Scheme transacted a buy-in policy for \u00a379m covering all remaining uninsured members. As a result the Group no longer bears any longevity, interest rate or in/flation risk in respect of the pension scheme. The buy-in policy is an investment asset of the Scheme.\n\nThe Company did not operate any de/fined contribution schemes or de/fined bene/fit schemes during the /financial years ended 31 March 2023 or 31 March 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All awards are equity settled and therefore the fair value is measured at the grant date. Where the awards have non-market related performance criteria, the Group uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. Where the awards have Total Shareholder Return (TSR) market related performance criteria, the Group has used the Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to establish the relevant fair values. The resulting values are amortised through the income statement over the vesting period of the awards. For awards with non-market related criteria, the charge is reversed if it appears probable that the performance or service criteria will not be met.\n\nThe following table analyses the total cost recognised in the income statement for the year between each plan, together with the number of options outstanding.\n\n|                               | Charge  \u00a3m   | 2023 Number  (millions)   | Charge  \u00a3m   | 2022 Number  (millions)   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| Long-Term Incentive Plan      | 3            | 3                         | 2            | 2                         |\n| Deferred Share Bonus Plan     | 1            | -                         | -            | -                         |\n| Executive Share Option Scheme | -            | 1                         | -            | 1                         |\n| Sharesave Plan                | -            | 1                         | 1            | 1                         |\n| Restricted Share Plan         | 2            | 2                         | 1            | 1                         |\n|                               | 6            | 7                         | 4            | 5                         |\n\nA summary of the main features of each type of plan is given below. The plans have been split into two categories: Executive plans and Other plans. For further details on the Executive plans, see the Directors' Remuneration Report on pages 100 to 113.\n\n## Executive plans: Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nThe LTIP is open to Executive Directors, Executive Leadership Team members and senior management members with awards made at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. In addition, other than for Executive Directors, an award of 'matching shares' could be made where the individual acquired shares in Land Securities Group PLC and pledged to hold them for a period of three years. The awards are issued at nil consideration, subject to performance and vesting conditions being met. Awards of LTIP shares and matching shares are subject to the same performance criteria and normally vest after three years. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the Employee Bene/fit Trust (EBT). There were no awards exercised during the year (2022: the weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 752p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a37m (2022: \u00a37m).\n\n## Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP)\n\nThe Executive Directors' annual bonus is structured in two distinct parts made up of an initial payment and deferred shares. The shares are usually deferred for one or two years and are not subject to additional performance criteria. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of existing shares held by the EBT at nil consideration. The weighted average share price at the date of vesting during the year was 615p (2022: 703p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a32m (2022: \u00a31m).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. There were no awards exercised during the year (2022: none). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\n## Sharesave Plan\n\nUnder the Sharesave Plan, Executive Directors and other eligible employees are invited to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave plan operated by Equiniti. On completion of the three or /five year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a price based upon the middle market price on the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of invitation less 20% discount. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 717p (2022: 764p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a31m (2022: \u00a31m).\n\n## Restricted Share plan (RSP)\n\nThe RSP started in the year ended 31 March 2020. It is open to qualifying management level employees with awards granted as nil cost options. Awards are discretionary and are granted over ordinary shares of the Company at the middle market price on the day immediately preceding date of grant. Awards normally vest after three years and are not subject to performance conditions. Awards are satis/fied by the transfer of shares from the EBT and lapse ten years after the date of grant. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for awards exercised during the year was 697p (2022: 787p). The estimated fair value of awards granted during the year under the scheme was \u00a36m (2022: \u00a32m).\n\nThe aggregate number of awards outstanding, and the weighted average exercise price, are shown below:\n\n|                                             | Executive plans 1      | Executive plans 1       |                        |                         |                                  |                                  |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                             | Number of awards       | Number of awards        | Number of awards       | Number of awards        | Weighted average  exercise price | Weighted average  exercise price |\n|                                             | 2023 Number (millions) | 2022 Number  (millions) | 2023 Number (millions) | 2022 Number  (millions) | 2023 Pence                       | 2022 Pence                       |\n| At the beginning of the year                | 2                      | 2                       | 2                      | 2                       | 805                              | 821                              |\n| Granted                                     | 2                      | 1                       | 1                      | -                       | 685                              | 662                              |\n| Exercised                                   | -                      | -                       | -                      | -                       | 736                              | 635                              |\n| Lapsed                                      | (1)                    | (1)                     | -                      | -                       | 699                              | 781                              |\n| At 31 March                                 | 3                      | 2                       | 3                      | 2                       | 768                              | 805                              |\n| Exercisable at the end of the year          | -                      | -                       | 1                      | 1                       | 2,072                            | 1,367                            |\n|                                             | Years                  | Years                   | Years                  | Years                   |                                  |                                  |\n| Weighted average remaining contractual life | 1                      | 1                       | 2                      | 3                       |                                  |                                  |\n\n- 1.

The expected life used in the model has been determined based upon management's best estimate for the e/ffects of non-transferability, vesting/exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. The risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an award on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated vesting of that award.\n\n## Fair value inputs for awards with market performance conditions\n\nFair values are calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.

Based on an assessment of the relevant tax rules, in addition to advice received from external parties, the Group does not believe that any tax is due and has written to the authorities explaining that position. It is not possible to accurately state the timing of any potential out/flow, as the Group awaits further correspondence from the tax authorities.

In the year ended 31 March 2023, share options are excluded from the weighted average diluted number of shares when calculating EPRA diluted earnings per share because they are not dilutive, based on IFRS loss for the year.\n- 2. EPRA LTV is a new measure introduced by EPRA in the current year. The EPRA measure di/ffers from the Group LTV presented in note 21 as it includes net payables and receivables, and includes trading properties at fair value and debt instruments at nominal value rather than book value. EPRA LTV was not presented in the /financial statements as at 31 March 2022 as the measure had not yet been introduced. EPRA LTV would have been presented as 35.5% at 31 March 2022.\n- 3. This measure re/flects voids in the Combined Portfolio excluding only properties under development.\n- 4. This measure relates to the Combined Portfolio, excluding properties currently under development, calculated by our external valuer and includes certain developments that currently generate income from meanwhile use. Excluding all developments, the EPRA NIY is 5.4% and the EPRA topped up NIY is 5.9%, refer to Table 4 in the Operating and portfolio review for further details. Topped-up NIY re/flects adjustments of \u00a339m for rent free periods and other incentives.\n- 5. This measure is calculated based on gross rental income after rents payable and excluding costs recovered through rents but not separately invoiced of \u00a39m.\n\n## EPRA vacancy rate\n\nThe EPRA vacancy rate is based on the ratio of the estimated market rent for vacant properties versus total estimated market rent, for the Combined Portfolio excluding properties under development. There are no signi/ficant distorting factors in/fluencing the EPRA vacancy rate.\n\n|                                                                  |   Table 71 31 March  2023  \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| ERV of vacant properties                                         |                          26   |\n| ERV of Combined Portfolio excluding properties under development |                         617   |\n| EPRA vacancy rate (%)                                            |                           4.2 |\n\n| Change in net rental income from the like-for-like portfolio   |   2023  \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m | \u00a3m   | Table 72 Change %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------|------|---------------------|\n| Central London                                                 |        251 |       225 | 26   | 12                  |\n| Major retail                                                   |        120 |       137 | (17) | (12)                |\n| Subscale sectors                                               |         95 |        74 | 21   | 28                  |\n|                                                                |        466 |       436 | 30   | 7                   |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The forecast minimum PID for the year ended 31 March 2023 is \u00a3197m, which must be paid by 31 March 2024. The Group has already made PID dividends relating to 31 March 2023 of \u00a3158m, leaving \u00a339m to be paid in the coming year.\n\nOur latest tax strategy can be found on our corporate website. In the year, the total taxes we incurred and collected were \u00a3134m (2022: \u00a3154m), of which \u00a338m (2022: \u00a357m) was directly borne by the Group including environmental taxes, business rates and stamp duty land tax. The Group has a low tax risk rating from HMRC.\n\n## REIT Balance of Business\n\nTo retain the Group's REIT status, it must meet conditions from the REIT legislation. At least 75% of the Group's assets and 75% of the Group's income must relate to qualifying activities.

Energy consumption is reported as kWh and no normalisation technique is applied. Carbon emissions are reported as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e). We report our full greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually in accordance to the WRI Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, including scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\nAt Landsec, scope 1 comprises emissions from natural gas and refrigerant gases. Scope 2 emissions are from electricity, heating and cooling purchased for common areas and shared services. All material sources of scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported. As the remaining sources (e.g. diesel used in generator testing) represent such a small proportion of total emissions, we do not report them.\n\nScope 2 emissions are reported using both the 'location-based' and 'market-based' accounting methods. Location-based emissions are reported using the UK Government's 'Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2022'. Scope 2 market-based emissions are reported using the conversion factor associated with each individual electricity, heating and cooling supply, either obtained directly from the supplier or from their o/fficial company website.\n\nScope 3 emissions are those that are a consequence of our business activities, but which occur at sources we do not own or control and which are not classi/fied as scope 2 emissions. The GHG Protocol identi/fies 15 categories of which 8 are directly relevant for Landsec. Our scope 3 reporting methodology is detailed in our Sustainability Performance and Data Report on landsec.com/sustainability/reports-benchmarking.\n\n| Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions   | Landsec - Scope 1 and 2 emissions   |                                 |                                 |                                 |         |                               | Table 83                      |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                     |                                     | Location-based emission factors | Location-based emission factors | Location-based emission factors |         | Market-based emission factors | Market-based emission factors |\n| Emissions                           | Unit                                | 2020/21                         | 2021/22                         | 2022/23                         | 2020/21 | 2021/22                       | 2022/23                       |\n| Scope 1                             | tCO 2 e                             | 7,554                           | 7,151                           | 6,681                           | 7,554   | 7,151                         | 6,681                         |\n| Scope 2                             | tCO 2 e                             | 18,434                          | 18,338                          | 16,798                          | 2,079   | 2,054                         | 2,954                         |\n| Scope 1 and 2                       | tCO 2 e                             | 25,988                          | 25,489                          | 23,480                          | 9,633   | 9,205                         | 9,636                         |\n| Intensity                           |                                     |                                 |                                 |                                 |         |                               |                               |\n| Scope 1 and 2                       | kgCO 2 e/m 2                        | 14.23                           | 14.12                           | 12.70                           | 5.27    | 5.10                          | 5.21                          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions using location-based emission factors have decreased by 8% compared with the previous reporting year, despite an increase in occupancy levels. The decrease has been largely due to changes in emissions factors and actions taken to drive energy e/fficiency across our assets.\n\nThe detailed breakdown of main factors driving the change in our scope 1 and scope 2 can be seen in chart 84 Landsec Scope 1 and 2 emissions - year on year driving factors . In terms of market-based emissions, we have seen a small increase (5%) due to the inclusion of two assets that have come under our operational control from 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our scope 3 reporting allows us to identify the most signi/ficant categories in our value chain that contribute to our carbon footprint - Capital goods and Downstream leased assets, make up over 76% of our total emissions.\n\nCapital goods include the emissions associated with the manufacture and transport of materials used within our development activities and portfolio projects. Downstream leased assets are those emissions associated with energy consumed by our customers within our assets.\n\nThe emissions from our development activities have decreased by 25% due to the fact that the four projects on-site are nearing completion and the materials delivered during this phase are much less carbon intensive than in the earlier phases of structural works. In table 87, we provide the amount of embodied carbon emissions reported for each development in 2022/23.\n\nIn relation to Downstream leased assets, we continue engaging our customers (speci/fically those in our retail assets) to increase the share of primary tenant energy usage data (now at 63% - a 6% increase compared with last year), thereby increasing data accuracy. There's a 2% reduction in carbon emissions as compared with last year for this category which can be explained by the increase of actual data included in the calculation.\n\nBecause both categories represent a signi/ficant proportion of our total carbon footprint, we are committed to understanding the source of these emissions and taking action to reduce them. As such, for all our development and refurbishment schemes, we undertake life-cycle assessments, following the RICS guidance document 'Whole life carbon assessment for the built environment' 1st Edition and BS EN 15978. We will adopt the latest RICS guidance document once adopted. The assessment considers both the upfront embodied carbon emissions from our supply chain and construction activities (stages A1 to A5), as well as anticipated emissions from a building's operations and embodied carbon associated with maintenance and repairs over the lifetime of the building (stages B1 to C4). To minimise our construction impacts, we set targets on the upfront embodied carbon emissions from supply chain (A1-A5) on a project-by-project basis and track these through to the completion of our buildings. We also track the carbon emissions from Modules B and C to ensure that the decisions we make for upfront embodied carbon do not lead to negative consequences in the long term, for example higher replacement rates. Once all reduction opportunities have been achieved, we o/ffset the remainder of the upfront embodied carbon emissions of our buildings at practical completion, in alignment with the UK Green Building Council guidelines. We also carefully design our buildings to minimise the energy demand of our operations and meet this demand through renewable electricity contracts.",

For most shareholders, PIDs will be paid after deducting withholding tax at 20%. However, certain categories of shareholder may be able to receive PIDs gross, (i.e. without deduction of withholding tax).\n\nThese categories are principally UK companies, charities, local authorities, UK pension schemes and managers of ISAs, PEPs and Child Trust Funds.\n\nA REIT may additionally pay ordinary dividends which will be treated in the same way as dividends from non-REIT companies.\n\nFurther information on UK REITs and the forms required to be completed to apply for PIDs to be paid gross are available on the Landsec website or from the Registrar: landsec.com/ investorsshareholders-equity-investors/uk-reit-regimeand-dividends .\n\n## Payment of dividends to UK resident shareholders\n\nDividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal bank or building society account or alternatively sign up to our Dividend Reinvestment Plan (see below). Under this arrangement, dividend con/firmations are still sent to your registered address.\n\nReceiving dividends directly into a nominated account has a number of advantages, including the crediting of cleared funds on the actual dividend payment date.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so should contact the Registrar (Equiniti) or complete a mandate instruction available on our website landsec.com/investorsshareholders-equityinvestors/dividend-information and return it to the Registrar. Alternatively, these details can be sent via their Equiniti Shareview online account, which is available on our website on the investors page under shareholders or directly at Equiniti: shareview.co.uk .\n\n## Payment of dividends to non-UK resident shareholders\n\nAs applicable to UK resident shareholders, dividend payments by cheque ceased from October 2020 and all shareholders are now required to have their dividends paid directly into their personal bank or building society account. Payments to overseas accounts are made a few days after the Company's dividend payment date.\n\nShareholders who have not already done so are encouraged to contact the Registrar (Equiniti) on +44 (0)371 384 20301 or download an application form online at shareview.co.uk or provide these details via their Equiniti Shareview online account.\n\nThis service is available in over 90 countries worldwide.\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)\n\nThe DRIP provides shareholders with the opportunity to use cash dividends to increase their shareholding in Landsec. It is a convenient and cost-e/ffective facility provided by Equiniti Financial Services Limited. Under the DRIP, cash dividends are automatically used to purchase shares in the market as soon as possible after the dividend payment. Any residual cash will be carried forward to the next dividend payment.\n\nDetails of the DRIP, including terms and conditions and participation election forms, are available on our website in the investor section under shareholders.\n\nThese are also available by post from: Dividend Reinvestment Plans Equiniti Telephone: +44 (0)371 384 2268\u00b9\n\nAspect House, Spencer Road, Lancing, West Sussex BN99 6DA\n\n## Share dealing facilities\n\nEquiniti provides both existing and prospective UK shareholders with an easy to access and simple-to-use share dealing facility for buying and selling Landsec shares online, by telephone, or post.

Net assets per share is also commonly known as net asset value per share (NAV per share).\n\n## Net initial yield\n\nNet initial yield is a calculation by the Group's external valuer of the yield that would be received by a purchaser, based on the Estimated Net Rental Income expressed as a percentage of the acquisition cost, being the market value plus assumed usual purchasers' costs at the reporting date.

It is stated gross, prior to the deduction of ground rents and without deduction for operational outgoings on car park and commercialisation activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Equivalent yield\n\nCalculated by the Group's external valuer, equivalent yield is the internal rate of return from an investment property, based on the gross outlays for the purchase of a property (including purchase costs), re/flecting reversions to current market rent and such items as voids and non-recoverable expenditure but ignoring future changes in capital value. The calculation assumes rent is received annually in arrears.\n\n## ERV - Gross estimated rental value\n\nThe estimated market rental value of lettable space as determined biannually by the Group's external valuer.

Properties in the development pipeline and completed developments are also excluded.\n\n## Loan-to-value (LTV)\n\nGroup LTV is the ratio of adjusted net debt, including subsidiaries and joint ventures, to the sum of the market value of investment properties and the book value of trading properties of the Group, its subsidiaries and joint ventures, all on a proportionate basis, expressed as a percentage.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
